I'm not sure if this is going to sell out or not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll send out a sign up sheet next week for brunch at Zaftigs. The show is at 2:00 pm. We should probably get there at 1:15 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to Brunch with us at 11:00 am at Zaftig's Deli down the street. Sign ups are at: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/calendar/12352698/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&lt;/b&gt;: Simulcast of London's National Theatre&lt;br /&gt;performance of Nation, Terry Pratchett's new play&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When&lt;/b&gt;: Saturday, January 30th, 2010 at 2:00 pm ( line up at 1:15 pm). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price&lt;/b&gt;: $20.00 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Cheryl White, who helps organize both lectures at the Museum of Science, and Coolidge Corner's Science on Screen program:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I’m writing to you with my Coolidge Corner Theatre hat on versus my MOS hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I wanted to let you know that on &lt;b&gt;Saturday, January 30&lt;/b&gt;, the Coolidge will present, direct from the London stage, a live simulcast broadcast of &lt;b&gt;Nation&lt;/b&gt;, a play based on the novel by the great fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett.  Nation is the third play in the pilot season of NT Live, a series of four plays transmitted live in high definition from the UK’s prestigious National Theatre onto cinema screens around the world.   The Coolidge is the only venue exhibiting NT Live in the Boston area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Details follow.  I thought this might be something [Nerd Fun] would be interested in.  It’s the only opportunity to see this extraordinary production without having to travel to London&amp;quot;.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Thanks so much Cheryl! As you can see, I passed along the details to people. What? There's more information? First we need to figure out ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty-five minutes before showtime, rain or shine, the Coolidge Corner Theater lines up people single-file along the brick wall to wait a half-hour for the doors to open. After ten minutes, the line snakes all along the wall of the alley and turns the corner of the next block. This makes it quite difficult to form up as a group. Although the show doesn't start until 2:00 pm, I was thinking we should all get in line as a group at &lt;b&gt;1:15 pm&lt;/b&gt;. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Care to meet up somewhere for brunch beforehand? I'll create a sign-up sheet a week before for &lt;b&gt;Zaftigs Delicatessen&lt;/b&gt; at 335 Harvard Street in Brookline, MA so we can start getting a headcount on reserving a table. Menus can be found on their site at &lt;a href="http://www.zaftigs.com/menus.html"&gt;http://www.zaftigs.co...&lt;/a&gt; . The bagels, lox, and chopped liver is excellent. They have a wide variety of sandwiches and food for breakfast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Your Jewish mother will kvell over the brisket even if she doesn't take to tray offerings such as pork sausages and smoked ham. Kosher, this is not. In fact, what has made this 'new Jewish'-style restaurant one of the best eating spots in Brookline are the less traditional offerings, including cheddar-apple omelets and banana stuffed French toast. The wild artwork and hip young wait staff seal the deal; this ain't your grandma's deli. Zaftigs Delicatessen serves breakfast (all day), lunch, and dinner. Located in Coolidge Corner in Brookline, there are public parking lots available and convenient parking available using meters along Harvard Street&amp;quot;.  [ &lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.zaftigs.com/directions.html"&gt;http://www.zaftigs.co...&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the show&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Coolidge Corner Theatre will present a live broadcast of the London National Theatre’s production of Nation, a powerful story of survival and self-discovery based on the novel by bestselling fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett, on Saturday, January 30 at 2 pm.  An encore presentation (pre-recorded) will follow on Saturday, February 15, at 2 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nation takes place in a parallel world in 1860. Two teenagers are thrown together by a tsunami that has destroyed Mau’s village and left Daphne shipwrecked on his South Pacific island, thousands of miles from her aristocratic home in Victorian England. Neither speaks the other’s language; somehow they must learn to survive. As starving refugees gather, Daphne delivers a baby, milks a pig, brews beer and does battle with a mutineer. Mau fights cannibal Raiders, discovers the world is round and questions the reality of his tribe’s fiercely patriarchal gods. Together they come of age, overseen by an acerbic parrot, as they discard old doctrine to forge a new Nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Live music, thrilling dance and dazzling puppetry combine to bring to life the surprising and spectacular world of Terry Pratchett's Nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This brilliant production is the third play in the pilot season of NT Live, a series of four plays transmitted live from the UK’s prestigious National Theatre onto cinema screens around the world.  Each play is broadcast in stunning high-definition.  The Coolidge is proud to be the only venue exhibiting NT Live in the Boston area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Tickets are available in advance online at www.coolidge.org or at the Coolidge Corner Theatre box office, located at 290 Harvard Street in Brookline.  Ticket prices are $20 general admission; $17 for Coolidge members, and $10 for ages 15 and under.

It appears that this play is based on Terry Pratchett's Young Adult book, &amp;quot;Nation&amp;quot;.   . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amazon posts this review of the book, published September 30, 2008&lt;/i&gt;: &amp;quot;Critics praised Nation as a hybrid, deeply philosophical book aimed at young adults, but one likely to appeal to adults as well, much like Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy or J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. With echoes of William Defoe and William Golding, Nation takes the form of a 'classic Robinsonade,' notes the Washington Post—that is, a book in which characters on a desert island recreate civilization. As his characters grapple with questions of leadership, humanity, and survival, Pratchett explores fundamental ideas about religion and culture. This might all sound rather heavy, but there is plenty of originality and humor—and cannibals, spirits, and secret treasures—to go around. In the end, Pratchett offers a vision of a deeply humane world. 'In some part of the multiverse there is probably a civilisation based on the thinking of Terry Pratchett,' writes the Guardian, 'and what a civilised civilisation that will be.' &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this page from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nation-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061433012"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt; you can watch a three minute video of Terry Pratchett describing his book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Terry Pratchett (according to his site):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.terrypratchett.co.uk/terry-pratchett/"&gt;http://www.terrypratc...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Terry Pratchett is one of the most popular authors writing today and is the acclaimed creator of the bestselling Discworld series.
