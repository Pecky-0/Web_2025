Japan has always been at the aesthetic cutting edge, and this year's selection of promos and shorts proves no exception. With the likes of director Nagi Noda (Partizan Productions) leading the pack, the bar has been set very high. From the dizzily surreal to the so-cute-it-hurts, Mirrorball presents a veritable bento box of live action and animated visual styles. These selections from the Edinburgh Film Festival are arguably a collection of the best live action and animated music videos coming out of Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us as we continue to explore art in music videos as part of the MFA's Mirrorball series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater after the show. Post-movie, we will be going to a local cafe for snacks (sushi, anyone?) and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can music videos be art? Decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173119576000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170852768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mirrorball, the Art of the Music Video: Part 3, Made in Japan</name><id>5460430</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172946600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5460430/</event_url></item>
