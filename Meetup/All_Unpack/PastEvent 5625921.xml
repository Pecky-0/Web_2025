Volunteering on an animal sanctuary for a couple of hours and then eating a nice big picnic lunch together afterwards. This is a &amp;quot;Bring your own food&amp;quot; event, and there will be no way to keep food warm unless you can find a way to yourself. If you can''t set aside that much time, you can always come for one part or the other. But you'll love my favorite wooly friends, the close-talkers! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CARPOOLING IS AVAILABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place: Maple Farm Sanctuary *See the bottom of this section for the rain location!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time: Work begins at 11 - Lunch begins at 1 (Times are approx)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Farm Sanctuary is a safe and loving refuge for farmed animals given a &lt;br /&gt;second chance at life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located on a 121 acre farm in Mendon, MA, the sanctuary is home to cows, pigs,&lt;br /&gt;chickens, goats, llamas, horses and many other individuals who had once endured &lt;br /&gt;miserable lives of fear and suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, they live the remainder of their lives in peace, free to roam and&lt;br /&gt;meander among the land to share with our human and non-human family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Rain Location to be announced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, email me with any questions!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183680738000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175450620000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp May Meetup</name><id>5625921</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178506800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/5625921/</event_url></item>
