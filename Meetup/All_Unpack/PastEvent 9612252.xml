And since I haven't organized an official running group yet, I figured I would double post this to the running group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So without further ado ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get in some cross country skiing before we settle in and watch the big game. The conditions should be great with all the new snow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the touring center at 10. Depending upon whose there we'll probably split up into groups by ability. I figure we can ski for a hour and half and then meet back at the center for lunch. Afterward people can continue skiing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a lunch, beverages, and some snacks. And dress in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day pass at the center costs $11 dollars (cash only). They also rent skis at the center.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a yellow cap with a bucking bronco on it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>4878639</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233708713000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233076070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cross Country Ski on Super Sunday</name><id>9612252</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233500400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/9612252/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
