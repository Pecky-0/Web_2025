Though if you wait for the day-of, you might score a half-off &amp;quot;Rush&amp;quot; ticket (if you get one at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRE-PARTY:&lt;/b&gt; I don't know yet if we'll be up for dinner before.  If you're interested, let me know, and I'll get back to you about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; Jason, cell #203-901-4957 (calling or texting is fine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TICKETS:&lt;/b&gt; Info on buying is &lt;a href="http://www.artidea.org/view_page.php?id=38" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy at the door, at the Box Office, by phone, or online.  Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.artidea.org/event.php?id=19" target="_blank"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the actual event.  Tickets range from $7-45; most of them are $33.  We already have our tickets since we didn't want to miss-out and wanted good seats.  If you want to try to get tickets near us, we're in mezzanine row B, seats 1 &amp;amp; 2 (not cheap seats).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARKING:&lt;/b&gt; If you're going to a paid Arts &amp;amp; Ideas event you're supposed to get a voucher for discounted parking along with your ticket.  A list of garages accepting these vouchers is &lt;a href="http://www.artidea.org/view_page.php?id=51" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to the Shubert are &lt;a href="http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_directions.php" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to arrange car-pools, chat about the event, etc, click &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/messages/boards/thread/4893423#18625729"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to visit the thread on the message board&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214784348000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213476774000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fri. 6/27 - Opera star in New Haven</name><id>8143431</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214611200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8143431/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/1/f/global_4453311.jpeg</photo_url></item>
