We'll meet at Sidebar at 8pm. I have a deal set up for $20 per person that'll include some apps,&amp;nbsp;and one drink token per person.&amp;nbsp;Please bring cash because we won't be able to do separate checks for cards for that portion. They'll set us up in the lounge, and then around 10:30, we have to give that space up. So we can stay at Sidebar or we can travel to different bars. We'll get a group consensus then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't join for the food/drink/cover deal, please let me know. I need to give them an estimate&amp;nbsp;of how many people and I don't want to be stuck with a large bill at the end because no one wanted to join for that part. No big deal, I just need to know in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need to get a hold of me - call/text 716-307-6590&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
