Price is reasonable, food is fabulous. said, Beverly on July 19, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with twenty of us in agreement it seems like the right time to schedule a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do lunch, the buffet to be precise, it consists of multi course vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes along with salads, bread, rice and desserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamarind Bay offers a variation of Indian cuisine in a sophisticated yet intimate setting. showcasing the fish, cocktails and foods from the coasts of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="http://www.tamarind-bay.com/TamarindBay-CoastalIndianKitchenDinnerMenu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Tamarind Bay Menu&lt;/a&gt; for a la carte options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARKING:  &lt;br /&gt;You should find parking at meters along Beacon Street, which are operational during our meal. Therefore have quarters to feed the meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I list the Reservation Rules, please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it will be fairly and strictly enforced.  &lt;br /&gt;I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well, you have transportation issues, you don't have the money, or you just don't want to be around people. My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me, you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules for Events with Reservations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at (617) 445-7549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All RSVPs are on a first reply, first seated basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If brunch is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will automatically be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the brunch and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I change you're RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update brunch confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within twenty-four hours of the brunch, it is counted as a NO-SHOW if you do not contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email Tonya about rejoining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so please, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will arrive at 12:00 PM (noon)  to welcome you from Tamarind Bay bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beverly </member_name><member_id>3757831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297087784000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295409237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lunch Buffet at Tamarind Bay on Saturday February 5th at 12:15 PM</name><id>16102313</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296926100000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/16102313/</event_url></item>
