We will begin our indoor/outdoor season this month. I ask all members to please list which location you plan to attend in the comments section of your RSVP. This will help ensure that there's a &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; at each location. We don't want any lonely chihuahua roaming about. For those who are new to the group, all members can choose to attend one or both meetups     (boston common , meets neat boylston T stop on the green @ 11AM) and/or Doggie Day play center at our usual time of 1:00pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Mother's Day....chi moms and all&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indoor meetup will be held at Doggie day &lt;b&gt;(1-3pm)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should anyone have any questions, feel free to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;Susana&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2067938</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247414294000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Chihuahua Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>chihuahua-99</urlname><id>32412</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Chihuahua Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241972387000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chihuahua June Meetup</name><id>10379295</id><headcount>28</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244991600000</time><rsvp_limit>45</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chihuahua-99/events/10379295/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/global_6840113.jpeg</photo_url></item>
