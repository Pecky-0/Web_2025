While we suppose you could call TempleCon a convention, as many are quick to do, it's a bit more than that.  It's really a three day festival of modern hobby gaming and retro-futurist fandom, including events, performances and activities from all the genres out there that you can think of, and probably some that you can't.  It's also a social event, which means that while we're all about the entertainment, we're even more about the people who love it.  We started TempleCon for a lot of reasons, but one of them is because we think that things gaming and fandom need to finally be dragged out of the basement and into the ballroom.   TempleCon breaks a lot of the long-standing rules of &amp;quot;geek&amp;quot; conventions, and offers up a diverse event full of wild parties, great games, live music, crazy performances, guests, workshops, vendors, and a ton more stuff that we think you'll like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust us.  You want to be here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, check out the &lt;a href="http://templecon.org/11/" target="_blank"&gt;Templecon website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Registration</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>11219434</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297184094000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295806381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TempleCon 2011</name><id>jrthqypdbgb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296828000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/16153962/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
