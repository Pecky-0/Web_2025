<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>One of the satire-parody movies mocking the bestest genre ever, super-heroes. I'm REALLY looking forward to this one. :-)&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: for shows not playing in New Haven, I'll try picking  some at the North Haven theatre in the future. For this one, though, I have some co-workers coming, so Branford will be easier for them.&lt;br /&gt;We can meet at six at the nearby restaurant for food and drinks if anyone is interested. They have great chips and salsa for free. There's also a good diner nearby. Both are options for before or after. Please state your interest in your response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showtime is 7:25. Lets meet at the theatre at 7:15 and take seats at showtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailers: &lt;a href="http://movies.go.com/trailer?cid=939238&amp;amp;vid=939239" target="_blank"&gt;http://movies.go.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synopsis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Riker (Drake Bell) is just your average ordinary dorky teenager until he's bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly. Acquiring the bug's powers, Rick transforms himself into the superhero the Dragonfly. He also gets his own supervillain to fight: the Hourglass (Christopher McDonald), who has the ability to steal a person's lifeforce. This comedy spoofs both the Spider-Man movies and other superflicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Neil&lt;br /&gt;203-645-2008&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208474543000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208046322000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movies and muchies: Super-hero Movie</name><id>7728414</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208301300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7728414/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
