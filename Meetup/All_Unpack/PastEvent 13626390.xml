They will arrive about a week before the crawl will go quickly so if you would like one, please let me know and we'll need to make arrangements for the &amp;quot;exchange&amp;quot; prior to the crawl as carrying around a boatload of shirts to the crawl is not my cup of tea!  :-)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!  And as I tell all my friends on the crawl - at some point I might not remember that I saw you there, but I know I'll be happy that I saw you just the same  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Everyone will be wearing navy blue t-shirts with the logo on the back</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277863728000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275075431000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>8th Annual Drink &amp; Drool Pub Crawl</name><id>13626390</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276977600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/13626390/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/4/4/global_9179700.jpeg</photo_url></item>
