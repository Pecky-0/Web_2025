We had 8 people show up and we had a great time. As a group, we decided to make a few changes, first to change the meet-ups to Wednesday night (instead of Thursday) and also to move this meet-up to the East Bay Grill in Plymouth for the summer. It was a fun atmosphere, the food was great and it seems to be a location that everyone can find easily. As always, if you get there and  you can't find the group all my cell 847-361-8851-I have it on the table, so I will answer your call. Stop by and bring a friend. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask receptionist or call my cell phone 847-361-8851</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Ventre</member_name><member_id>5313492</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>karen r</member_name><member_id>12098520</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280425955000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Graphic-Designers-Writers-Web-Folks</urlname><id>1467271</id><group_lat>42.0400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Graphic Designers, Writers &amp; Web Folks</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280250362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>East Bay Grill</name><id>qkwznynkblc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280356200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Graphic-Designers-Writers-Web-Folks/events/14229533/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/f/global_9065663.jpeg</photo_url></item>
