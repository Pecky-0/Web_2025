&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;Showtime is 7, I will be at the theater by 6, and we will head in for seats by 6:30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I arrive at the theater an hour before the show to start gathering people, and we head in for seats about 30 minutes before the show, so we can sit together. This also allows us to take turns getting snacks, etc., before the previews start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993366"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;About Buying Advanced Tickets&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993366"&gt;I encourage everyone to consider buying your tickets in advance.  We see most movies on opening weekend and they do often sell out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993366"&gt;Fandango.com is the site that this movie theater uses.  Be warned though, there are sometimes hiccups to the system, especially the mobile app.  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993366"&gt;Not being able to complete a transaction does not mean they are sold out.  Please don't post a comment to the site that the movie is sold out.  Zip me an email and I will check it out.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color : #993366"&gt;If it is indeed sold out, I will let people know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after. We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;$$$$Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after.$$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Plot Summary:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Hero is a word we hear often in sports, but heroism is not always about achievements on the field of play. "42" tells the story of two men—the great Jackie Robinson and legendary Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey—whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball. In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking—ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a meetup pin.
