You may feel that there must be something "more," and you long to know what that is. You begin to search for the meaning of life, and your longing causes you to open to God and the spiritual world. Come join us for a seminar that will explore this great awakening and will lay out what a true spiritual life looks like. There will be plenty of time for questions and for a firsthand experience of the spiritual world. An emphasis will be placed on how you can begin to grow closer to God while coming to know who you really are and why you are here.
