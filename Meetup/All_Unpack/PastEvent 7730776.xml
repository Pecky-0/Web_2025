Just bring a little something to share, have some coffee or tea, and let's get to know each other.  We will answer any question you may have about cohousing in general or JP Cohousing in particular, then take you for a tour of our Common House which includes the kid's room, living room, Great Room, kitchen, mailroom, offices, rumpus room, laundry, and guest suite.
