When we practice observing the mind, we notice it is continually making commentary, and we cultivate the ability to carefully observe those thoughts, seeing them for what they are without aversion or judgement. We learn to be more present by realizing that thoughts are just thoughts, allowing us to let go of unhelpful, conditioned thinking. We will meet to discuss the benefits, challenges and opportunities of a mindfulness practice as a path to improved quality of life, and support each other as we explore this practice individually and collectively. Guided and/or group meditation may be included in gatherings. And we can discover additional ways to practice mindfulness beyond meditation, like when waiting in lines, at traffic lights, or while walking. All levels of experience are welcome. Please bring your sense of humor (nothing should be taken too seriously).&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.67</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1219844288000</created><lat>43.6599998474</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1322</id><urlkey>meditation</urlkey><name>Meditation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>6126</id><urlkey>etolle</urlkey><name>Eckhart Tolle</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10290</id><urlkey>spirituality</urlkey><name>Spirituality</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10306</id><urlkey>wellness</urlkey><name>Wellness</name></topics_item></topics><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name><id>1270329</id><members>463</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>7931343</member_id><name>TomC</name></organizer><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/b/c/600_196335292.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/b/c/highres_196335292.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>196335292</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/b/c/thumb_196335292.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Portland</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/</link><lon>-70.2600021362</lon></item>
