The truth that life contains suffering that is due to one’s attachments is a lesson that humans must learn over and over in varying degrees and layers. Detachment from the world and attachment to truth brings peace to the heart and mind. This seminar will explore the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism and how they can be applied to modern spiritual development. Join us for a trip up the mountain toward freedom.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the Orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227743460000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223569393000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  The Road Up the Mountain: The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism</name><id>8930507</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226761200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/8930507/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/c/global_5804972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
