The two friends first banded together in college before combining their musical talents and touring the northwestern Oregon circuit. By 2006, however, they'd decided that a change of scenery might help fuel their songwriting. Blind Pilot consequently relocated 90 miles north, where they spent three months inside an Astoria warehouse while recording demos for a full-length album. Afterwards, Nebeker and Dobrowski launched a &amp;quot;bike tour&amp;quot; that saw them traveling from Vancouver to San Francisco via their bicycles, playing shows and selling EPs (not to mention saving gas money) along the way. They returned home to finalize their 3 Round and a Sound debut, which was released by Expunged Records in June 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Low Anthem (from allmusic):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Low Anthem's unique brand of Americana makes room for gospel, folk, and blues, a blend that began taking shape in the trio's hometown of Providence, RI. Ben Knox Miller and Jeff Prystowsky -- both students at Brown University, as well as late-night DJs at the school's radio station -- formed the group in 2006, drawing upon their background as classical composers to help mold the eclectic music. Jocie Adams joined one year later, and the Low Anthem began widening their arsenal of instruments accordingly, utilizing everything from World War I pump organs to crotales in the process. After making their independent debut with 2007's What the Crow Brings, the band rang in 2008 by temporarily relocating to Block Island -- a remote location 12 miles off the Rhode Island coast -- to record an album with producer Jesse Lauter. The stark, serene environment proved to be an appropriate for the music, which the band initially self-released under the title Oh My God, Charlie Darwin. As their buzz continued to build, and the Low Anthem signed a contract with Nonesuch Recordings and reissued Oh My God in 2009, supporting the release with a string of performances at summer festivals.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/text me on 617-549-8453</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew</member_name><member_id>8828135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258251234000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255630284000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blind Pilot / The Low Anthem @ Paradise</name><id>11635028</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258077600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/11635028/</event_url></item>
