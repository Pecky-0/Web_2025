Feel free to place it on the calendar as an event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Memento (According to Wikipedia):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Memento is a 2000 psychological thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, adapted from his younger brother Jonathan's short story 'Memento Mori'. It stars Guy Pearce [L.A. Confidential] as Leonard Shelby, a man with anterograde amnesia which renders his brain unable to store new memories. During the opening credits, (which portrays the end of the story) we are shown that Leonard has just killed [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;... Let's just say that over the course of the film, you see Leonard kill a man, and part of the fun is watching the movie unfold as you try to decipher Leonard's reasons for committing that cold-blooded act as the movie slowly unfolds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This film is often used to show the distinction between plot and story. The film's events unfold in two separate, alternating narrativesâ€”one in color, and the other in black and white. The black and white sections are told in chronological order, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous phone caller in a motel room. Leonard's investigation is depicted in color sequences that are in reverse chronological order. As each sequence begins, the spectator is unaware of the preceding events, just like Leonard, thereby giving the viewer a sense of his confusion. By the film's end when the two narratives converge we understand the investigation and the events that lead up to the death of [the victim].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Memento premiered on September 5, 2000 at the Venice Film Festival to critical acclaim and received a similar response when it was released in European theaters starting in October 2000. Critics especially praised its unique, nonlinear narrative structure and themes of memory, perception, grief, self-deception, and revenge. The film was successful at the box office and received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Original Screenplay and Editing&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Come, let us get confused together, then try to sort it all out over beer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care to grab a bite to eat beforehand? T.J.
