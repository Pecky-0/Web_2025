This one spends very little time on 9/11, starts with a great deal on the money system, then goes from there. A great deal of time is given to John Perkins (Confessions of an Economic Hit Man), which is very revealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zeitgeist: Addendum&lt;/b&gt; presents the really big picture vision of what we can be and what we can do to help develop our world into the place it can be - it's a really grand vision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is &lt;b&gt;an interesting offshoot of the Zeitgeist movie&lt;/b&gt; is a large following of people who do want to do something about the problems we face. To address that, the creator of the film has also created the&lt;a href="http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Zeitgeist Movement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We should preface all of this with the statement that this month's movie may not be for all and the movement may not be for all, but if we have learned anything from 9/11 it's that we must remain open minded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll have a discussion&lt;/b&gt; after the video regarding what we can do, including how each person can become more involved in this group and spread the workload of running a meetup like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: 1st Tuesday-Nashua; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; 4th Tuesday- Plymouth. If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, maybe we'll have a Truth Party somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 6:30&lt;/b&gt; if you can, in order to help set up your snacks and beverages (that you bring to share with others) and enjoy the pre-meeting conversations. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and then on to the video showing right after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have set up a &lt;a href="http://mv911t.erideshare.com" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; online at eRideShare.com. Ride-sharing arrangements can now be made by clicking on the link above to go to the online ridesharing group. Our group nickname is &amp;quot;mv911t&amp;quot; and our password is &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;. You can post if you are driving to one of our events and have extra seats - if you're looking for a ride to an event just logon and post that you're seeking a ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, donations to the driver for the ride-sharing are appreciated to cover gas costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be fiddling with the A/V equipment</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225040762000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223260783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concord - Zeitgeist: Addendum</name><id>8904506</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224628200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/8904506/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/c/global_5909420.jpeg</photo_url></item>
