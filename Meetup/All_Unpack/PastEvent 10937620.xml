We will cover the topic of MEDITATION AND PRAYER WITH CHILDREN and how to help them to develop a LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD and Its creation. All faith are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my work as a minister, as a family support specialist for the City of Cambridge and as a parent myself, I have witnessed and experienced that children thrive when they feel love and experience a sense of belonging to creation.
