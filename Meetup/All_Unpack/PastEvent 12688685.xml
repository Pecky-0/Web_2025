Who will run it?&lt;br /&gt;Should we get static displays? Who's? From where? LSA's?&lt;br /&gt;FPA Table?&lt;br /&gt;FCA Table?&lt;br /&gt;Rides?&lt;br /&gt;Who to invite?&lt;br /&gt;Advertise? Where?&lt;br /&gt;Other ideas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so we know who's coming. Probably have it at Bullocks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time we had a good meeting about OSH like this and got everything pretty much accomplished in one meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are invited and the input would be helpful. This is your airport and organization. Let's make this event a hit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Bisson</member_name><member_id>6711202</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267828566000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266966170000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FPA- AOPA- EAA  LTF day meeting...</name><id>12688685</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267655400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/12688685/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
