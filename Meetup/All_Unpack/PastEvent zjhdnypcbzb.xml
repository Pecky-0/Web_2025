May 2011 bring better health, happiness, and prosperity that 2010 left you with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been getting a lot of questions with regard to Trade Risk... For instance: -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where does trade risk actually come from?&lt;br /&gt;Can you actually control trade risk or is it really out of your hands?&lt;br /&gt;What's the easiest way of determining the risk on any given trade?&lt;br /&gt;How does one determine if the amount of risk is appropriate for the asset involved?&lt;br /&gt;How do you manage risk once the trade has been opened?&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I use Stops, it seems I get stopped out and then the trade goes the way I originally thought it would. How can I stop this from happening?&lt;br /&gt;What are some other methods of controlling risk without using stops?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I have decided to address this issue as the topic of our 1st meeting for 2011. If any of you have specific examples you'd care to share for discussion, they'd certainly be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a book they'd care to recommend, or provide a review on for the group, please let me know via email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, bringing questions regarding a favorite stock from your own watchlists (or perhaps even a trade from the past) for a group critique is very much encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to a lively and engaging discussion, and hope all can attend (if you have friends that might like to attend, please bring them along). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a lively meeting!
