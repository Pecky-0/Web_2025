<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Join us at the home of Laura Morrisette for conversation, listening to French music, and a book swap!   Bring a favorite French-language CD or song to play during the meetup (we won't be swapping CD's).   And, if you have French books you'd like to exchange, bring them to swap with another member.  Of course, it's OK if you simply want to join for conversation.  Please note, lunch will not be served, though you're welcome to bring your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura's address is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 Emily Lane - condo complex located across from 271 Davis Street, Greenfield MA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note Emily Lane is not on the map or GPS. Laura's is the last condo on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event has an end time of 3:30 PM.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Romy</member_name><member_id>8392408</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263321339000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernmassfrenchclub</urlname><id>1101087</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Western Mass French Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260148042000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Greenfield Meetup: Music &amp; Book Swap</name><id>12032388</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263148200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernmassfrenchclub/events/12032388/</event_url></item>
