Fate landed him a job assisting legendary photographer, Pete Turner. That experience helped him develop his own signature way of seeing things and launched his successful 30-plus year career as an editorial and commercial photographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this program you will discover how an upside down photo of a leaf in his studio led to his latest project, Shoe Fleur: A Footwear Fantasy, which has captured the imagination of a new generation of young designers and art directors. Michel will chronicle the genesis of the new book and detail the pitfalls and successes he experienced in the process of bringing it to bookshelves everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the twisted trail as Michel also recounts his journey through the wild business of advertising and editorial photography. Learn how he continuously thrives in today's marketplace by combining his imagination and technical virtuosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silent Auction&lt;br /&gt;During the program you can bid on a signed copy of Michel?s new book. Proceeds from the silent auction will benefit CIPNE?s educational activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-registration is required for this program.&lt;br /&gt;Cost: &lt;br /&gt;CIPNE Members - Free, Non-members - $5, Full-time Students - $5&lt;br /&gt;Go here to register (Non-members may pay by Paypal) &lt;a href="http://www.cipne.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cipne.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: on-line registration closes November 9th.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195081393000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192452187000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CIPNE Event: Michel Tcherevkoff</name><id>6552419</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194908400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/6552419/</event_url></item>
