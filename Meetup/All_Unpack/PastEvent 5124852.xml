How about a few drinks after work on a Thursday night.  The Met Club is a very hip bar in Chestnut Hill so please dress accordingly.  The week of September 24th-30th 50 bars in Boston and around Boston are offering a drink menu with drinks for $4.  Hopefully many of you can attend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of response from the group I am considering cancelling the group all together so lets try and get together and have a good event.  Hope to see you all there.....please RSVP yes or no.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540521000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialnetworking</urlname><id>251346</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158004308000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Afterwork Drinks</name><id>5124852</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158881400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialnetworking/events/5124852/</event_url></item>
