We will hike all the loops and do 6-7 mi.  There will be an option to shorten it by about 2 miles near the end if you need to leave early. There are some flats and small hills. This is a very scenic hike with a glacial boulder garden, historic cemetery, and old farms.  The hike will be around 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Moderate pace but depending on the group we may speed up a bit to make it into a real workout :)  Will still take time for pictures etc. Bring along water, snacks and insect repellant. Also DEM regulations require that hikers wear orange as it is still turkey season. An orange vest is the recommended fashion accessory! I know its last minute notice... but hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the parking lot. Address is 100 Plain Rd.
