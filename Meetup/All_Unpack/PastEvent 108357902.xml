&lt;p&gt;Plan Ahead for a Fun Day! &lt;br /&gt;

 -Rain or shine, dress for the weather! &lt;br /&gt;

 -Bring your dog if he/she will enjoy being around other people or dogs. &lt;br /&gt;

 -Keep your dog on a 6 ft. or shorter leash. For safety's sake, please, no retractable leashes. &lt;br /&gt;

 -Be courteous and responsible - please clean up after your dog. Bags will be available. &lt;br /&gt;

 -Walk the course only if you and your dog are in adequate physical condition to walk 1 mile. &lt;br /&gt;

 -Water will be provided for both dogs and people at the walk mid-point. Even if you are not thirsty, be sure to let your dog have plenty of access to the provided water.&lt;/p&gt;
