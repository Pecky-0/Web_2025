 Halloween Pancake Breakfast on Saturday, October 29th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come out with the family and enjoy pancakes &lt;br /&gt;

 (including our famous pumpkin pancakes!) &lt;br /&gt;

 sausage, juice and more all for the great price of free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, there is no charge but, the Jaycees are asking &lt;br /&gt;

 for monetary donations for the South Windsor Food &amp;amp; Fuel Bank in &lt;br /&gt;

 conjunction with our annual Thanksgiving Baskets for the &lt;br /&gt;

 Needy project that provides more than 100 less fortunate &lt;br /&gt;

 families in South Windsor with a lovely Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having a great breakfast there will be crafts &lt;br /&gt;

 for the kids and holiday photo opportunities. Children are &lt;br /&gt;

 welcome to wear costumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jaycees want you to plan on joining us for breakfast &lt;br /&gt;
