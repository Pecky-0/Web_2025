They had an event planned on the original date).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready for a fun night out in Manchester? We can eat at Hart's Turkey Farm located right next door to the Clarion Hotel. There is a fairly new comedy club called Headliners there. I have been a couple of times to this comedy club and the show was really funny. Tickets are $15 for the show. I haven't seen the comediens that will be performing on Oct. 17th, but let's try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a turkey dinner will get us in the mood for Thanksgiving. I have eaten at this restaurant once and is was good but not great. The location is perfect though as it is attached to the Clarion Hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase tickets online for the comedy show or call 669-2660 to reserve tickets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the websites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.headlinerscomedyclub.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.hartsturkeyfarm.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there!!!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256244356000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254281176000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Date change---Turkey Dinner and Comedy Night</name><id>11505224</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255816800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/11505224/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/5/global_10985029.jpeg</photo_url></item>
