Unfortunately, he finds out there is no real ending, only a run-down afterlife that is strikingly similar to his old one?just a bit worse. A comic and absurd road trip through purgatory, directed and co-written by Goran Dukic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: Goran Dukic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Patrick Fugit, Shannyn Sossamon, Shea Whigham, Tom Waits, Will Arnett, Leslie Bibb, John Hawkes, Mikal P. Lazarev, Sarah Roemer, Abraham Benrubi, Azura Skye, Nick Offerman, Mark Boone Junior, Jake Busey, Clayne Crawford&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: R &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run Time: 1hr 31mins &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the actual start time for the film is 2:05.  I wanted to see this a few weeks ago, but it quickly disappeared from the Kendall schedule.  I'm glad it's back.  I apologize for the late announcement, but I tend to do things at the last minute (3 days is actually in advance for me!)  I'll be at the front of the theater with a Meetup sign, and as usual we'll go to an area restaurant afterwards for the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it -- I want my first hosting gig a good one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195499040000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195077587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wristcutters: A Love Story 11/17/07</name><id>6742039</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195326000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6742039/</event_url></item>
