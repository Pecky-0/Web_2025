<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll meet at the Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square, walk down to Central, and then up north into Cambridge to check out the side streets for a change.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll map out a proposed route before the meetup, but if anyone has ideas, please share in the comments when you RSVP.  The Beacon Hill walk was well improvised with Sue pointing out a cool tiny street that I had no idea about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to try something new with this meetup - I'm putting no limit on the # of Yes's, but no Maybe's.  If you're undecided, just sign up at the last minute.  I've been using my phone to check the website for RSVPs instead of printing out a list, so it'll be up to the minute.   I will also post my cell # in the comments before I leave to meet up.  In the past I only usually get 1 out of 10 or so Maybe's which is why I'm trying this.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See my profile pic and I'll email my cell # to the rsvps.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249742947000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249008984000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harvard, Central, and Cambridge walk</name><id>10998890</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249512300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10998890/</event_url></item>
