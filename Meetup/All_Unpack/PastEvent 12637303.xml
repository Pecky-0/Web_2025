I've never been to the ICA before so I will stand near the doors where I can be seen easily.  I don't have a Meetup badge but I will be wearing a &amp;quot;Meetup red&amp;quot; peacoat and I look like my picture, so I should be pretty easy to spot.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;  If I don't see you come and introduce yourself to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand there will be a free tour from the lobby (I have not personally confirmed this) and we can either tag along or do our own thing.  A sizeable group from Social Fun will be there also.  They have plans to go out afterward for a bite to eat and something to drink.  We can each decide how we'd like our evening to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.icaboston.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.icaboston....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the lobby wearing a red peacoat and I look like my picture.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266708766000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266504337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Thursday at the Institute of Contemporary Art</name><id>12637303</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266535800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12637303/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
