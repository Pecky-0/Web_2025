Especially since it is FREE!  The Brazilian Women Organization are hosting a few events up to Sept. 9th to celebrate Brazil's Indepence.  This will be a festival so if you can only make it to one activity make it this one and feel free to bring as many people that you would like that are familiar or not with the Brazilian culture.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is from noon til 6 pm.  As the date approaches we can decide to meet at a specific location but as it is an all day many will be showing up at different times.  If anyone has any suggestions on how we can get together to mingle for a little bit let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more detailed information on this event and all other events relating to this go to www.verdeamarelo.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beijos!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189739402000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187111582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>12th Brazilian Independance Day Festival</name><id>6179271</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189353600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/6179271/</event_url></item>
