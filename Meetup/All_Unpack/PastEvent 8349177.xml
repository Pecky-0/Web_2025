These are always a great time and this one should be no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a chair/blanket, bring some beer/wine, bring your ability to enjoy free music while sitting outdoors with friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be at the green around 5:30pm to stake out a place for my blanket and start enjoying my crackers with cheese and wine. I can't say for sure where I'll be sitting yet, but if you can't find me give me a call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Jeanie (203) 494-3518&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216677830000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216175704000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Concert on the Green (with Squirrels)</name><id>8349177</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216504800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8349177/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/9/global_4807625.jpeg</photo_url></item>
