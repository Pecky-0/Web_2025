<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ok everyone, &lt;br /&gt;I'm going to run a D&amp;amp;D one-shot adventure.  I have the game all set and written out, and the minis have been bought.  It'll be a short game, about 5 hours.  I'm play testing it because I'll be running it at the &lt;a href="http://www.templecon.org/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;TempleCon&lt;/a&gt; event in February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise of the game:&lt;br /&gt;You are a group of adventurers traveling to the city of Orleans to search for your next mission.  En route, a peasant villager begs for your assistance to help his village.  The town is under attack by zombies and the Lord is nowhere to be found.  You gladly assist and ride fast to Thallen to dispense with the vile creatures.  But what happened to the Lord of the Manor.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game will be at my house on Sunday, January 28th.  The game will start promptly at 1pm, so come early to get familiar with your character and pick spells (if necessary).  Do not come any earlier than 12:30, but come well-fed because we will not break for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need 7 payers for the game.  It's absolutely critical, if you sign up to play the game, you MUST be here to play the game, otherwise it'll totally be off-balance.  I have all the characters pre-rolled, and they'll be distributed on a first pick basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characters:&lt;br /&gt;Edwina - Human Female Ranger 5 / Rogue 2&lt;br /&gt;Yarrish - Human Male Cleric 6&lt;br /&gt;Aldous - Human Male Fighter 6&lt;br /&gt;Mordekain - Human Male Barbarian 6&lt;br /&gt;Jaccob - Human Male Paladin 6&lt;br /&gt;Lupidia - Human Female Sorcerer 6&lt;br /&gt;Solak - Human Male Fighter 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game will be awesome!!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170210124000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1167837746000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lord Tamar's Manor</name><id>5361663</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170007200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/5361663/</event_url></item>
