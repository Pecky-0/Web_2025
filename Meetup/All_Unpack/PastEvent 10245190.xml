Being that this is the first time we'll be running a circle after a long break, I'm going to offer an orientation at the beginning of our session.  &lt;b&gt;I'm going to ask that everyone come for the 2:00pm session so that we can all be on the same page when we start drumming!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:00pm - The Energetics of the Drum Circle&lt;/b&gt; - Learn about the energies that flow through the drum circle and the ways in which the dancers and drummers interact to create the space together.  Learn why we set space and how you can participate in the event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:45pm - Setting the Space &lt;/b&gt;- Together we will create an altar that sets the tone for the circle for the day.  Bring with you something to place on the altar that represents you.  We'll create that container together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3:00pm - The Beginner's Circle&lt;/b&gt; - Are you new to drumming/dancing?  Perfect!  We'll be walking you through how to drum without hurting yourself, some basic rhythms, and how to listen and be a good contributing member of the circle.  Dancers, we'll talk about the form of drum circle dancing and how you fit into the mix.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:00pm Open Drumming &lt;/b&gt; - Bring your drums, rattles, Native American flutes, digeridoos, etc.  We will open up the room and get it rocking with the rhythms.  There will be space made for both heart-pounding beats and softer rhythms with room for voices and instruments.  There will be some instruments available for borrow, but it would be best in the beginning if everyone brings what they have so we are certain to have enough to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6:00pm - Closing Circle&lt;/b&gt; - We'll close the space as we opened it with a circling up of the participants and a closing of the energy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: &lt;/b&gt; Guess What?  After months of searching, we found a venue so happy to have us there that they are not charging us for the space.  &lt;b&gt;So, that means the event is FREE.  (YAY!!)&lt;/b&gt;  We will put out a donation basket for those who choose to contribute.  Donations will go to cover the costs of maintaining this meetup group and the costs of electricity and heat for the church.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE RSVP!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there's no charge for this event, I will be making copies of some handouts for the group and I'll need to know how many to make.  Please RSVP and come if you say you will so that I have enough copies for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The First Parish in Malden, a Unitarian Universalist congregation, is located three blocks west of the Malden Center T station at 2 Elm Street (intersection with Pleasant Street), just off Route 60. Convenient, free parking is available between the church and the Beebe Elementary School. Visit MaldenUUA.org for directions and map. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is our intention to run this event once each month on the third Sunday of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I look forward to seeing you all there!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There will be signs after you enter.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelle Sparta</member_name><member_id>1953058</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245607296000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Rhythm Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-drum-circle</urlname><id>617617</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240432467000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May Drum Circle Meetup</name><id>10245190</id><headcount>32</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242583200000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-drum-circle/events/10245190/</event_url></item>
