Sebastian's pregnant mother wants him to live with her and her West German boyfriend in a pleasant but dull Berlin suburb. Decidedly averse to the idea, Sebastian has come to seek refuge in his father's dilapidated apartment in Prenzlauer Berg. However, Sebastian's father - an unemployed country music fan - has quite enough problems of his own. After things went belly up in the electrical business and he was forced to close shop, he has been trying to find work in the security trade - without a shred of success so far. Sebastian soon realizes that what his father lacks is the right marketing strategy. Immediately, he sets about coaching his dad for the next interview. Nevertheless, the stubborn Marcel begins to take his son's precocious advice on board, and before long, the two indeed develop something of a comradely partnership. However, the special relationship between father and son is put to the test when Sebastian introduces his father to a beautiful girl named Nora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film and the Q&amp;amp;A with director Robert Thalheim we'll go to an area restaurant for a discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the exit holding a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207672913000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205724446000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Netto</name><id>7547439</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207499400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7547439/</event_url></item>
