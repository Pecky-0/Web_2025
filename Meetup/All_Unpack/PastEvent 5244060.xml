If anybody wants to show the group new things they've learned recently, feel free!  I'm sure people will want to discuss the Microsoft and Novell situation, and other Linux related topics are also &amp;quot;fair game&amp;quot;.  In situations like this, I was told that instead of viewing the meeting as having no specific topic, I should view the meeting as being open to *all* Linux related topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For future topics, I'm wondering if anybody would like to discuss the Open Source PBX using Asterisk, or ways that Linux and amateur radio work together.  You folks in the group have expertise in many varied areas - if you're interested in sharing any of this, please let me know, and we can use that as a topic for a future meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that extra parking can be found behind The Java Room by entering the parking lot near The Traveling Rhino store (just past the gas station on Rt. 110).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing you at the next meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andy Stewart</member_name><member_id>3117855</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163808631000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Linux Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>linux-393</urlname><id>304994</id><group_lat>42.6199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>The Chelmsford Linux Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162662117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Linux @ The Java Room</name><id>5244060</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163635200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/linux-393/events/5244060/</event_url></item>
