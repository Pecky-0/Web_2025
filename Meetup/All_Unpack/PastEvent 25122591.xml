The July 2nd barbecue was such a success, I've decided to organize another one! This time around I'd like to up the ante a little bit and ask folks to make (or buy) a special, mouth-watering vegan dish. Maybe we'll even have a little friendly competition and give out prizes to the dishes voted most delicious! With good press coverage, this event can do much to educate the public about alternatives to the standard American barbecue. We also had several local residents attend the last one, who had never tried vegan alternatives, and they LOVED the food! Folks have plenty of time to think about, plan, and prepare a really special vegan dish. Call me if you'd like suggestions. Let's educate more locals and show the public that we have more delicious vegan options than they ever imagined!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315253902000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310221618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's have a vegan barbecue at Tilton Island Park!</name><id>25122591</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315069200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/25122591/</event_url></item>
