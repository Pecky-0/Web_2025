<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thanks to those who showed up for our June discussion on naturalism and progressive politics - an animated back and forth between liberals and libertarians (well, one libertarian actually).  We reached at least one substantial conclusion: that if, as naturalists, we can agree on questions of fact, then the residual disagreements boil down to questions of values.  For instance, what sort of society should we become?  What's more important, personal liberty or social solidarity? These questions may well not be answerable by empirical inquiry, and therefore naturalists may well end up disagreeing on political issues. But this keeps things interesting - all too interesting perhaps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Michael Ratner kindly volunteered to formulate and lead the July discussion, particulars immediately below.  Please RSVP, and I hope you can make it.  Any ideas for future meetings most welcome (can include discussions, outings, movies, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July topic: Humanist Ethics in Light of Darwinian Evolution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: Does our current scientific understanding of the evolution of our species - Darwinian evolution as fleshed out by modern biology - have ethical implications?  Animal rights, cultural survival rights, eugenics, family law, immigration policy, racism, and more could each be considered from a Darwinian viewpoint.  Can Darwinian ideas be a force for good, or do they more or less inevitably lead to Social Darwinism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184195265000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181606573000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humanist ethics in the light of Darwinian evolution</name><id>5880478</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184022000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/5880478/</event_url></item>
