&lt;p&gt;What better way to begin the week than with good beer, food and  the coolest bunch of people to assemble round a table?  This week we  will be at the English Cellar Ale House. A fairly new addition to the  eastside, but already infamous for its faux British pub interior.   Come  on down as we make another showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying you aren't any good at  trivia is no excuse not to come out. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to  Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography?  Every little bit helps  and great conversation is guaranteed.  Game starts close to 8:00 and  runs for about 2 hours!  See you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**** Try to arrive a little  before 8:00 so that we can get good tables.  Any winnings will be  applied to a future event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ill be there with a meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>c</member_name><member_id>2264651</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1300407758000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Its always been a fun time based on past experience.
