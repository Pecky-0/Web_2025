<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;From June to September, celebrate Nights on the Neck on the first Thursday of the month from 5:30 to 9pm. Many galleries host receptions with refreshments. Musicians, dancers, authors, historians and other entertainers give performances and lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done this several times, and it's always been a great night out. We can walk the neck, visit the open galleries, listen to music, and end up at one of the restaurants for drinks &amp;amp; / food. This is a combined event with other meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*WE WILL MEETUP @ 5pm at The Rocky Neck Art Colony sign- the sign is at the public lot at the base of Rocky Neck Avenue. If you are unable to join us at 5, join us when you can. My contact # is: 978.289.7679. This is a mostly outdoor event - therefore, weather dependant. Please make sure to check for an update if weather is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
