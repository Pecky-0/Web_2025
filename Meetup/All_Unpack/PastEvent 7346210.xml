I had the pleasure of seeing them live at Geraldines and loved every minute.  They sing top 40 RB and Soul music of the 70's, 80's and 90's.  Their presentation and style is much like the Temptations but only more upbeat and contemporary.  The RC record label scout that was present at Geraldine's the night they performed was also very impressed.  This is your chance to see a great band in a chic and trendy club that caters to a  mature and elegant crowd.  The cover charge is $5.00 and includes a free buffet and happy hour if you arrive between 6:30-8:30p.m., live entertainment from 8:30-11:00p.m., and dance party from 11:00-2:00a.m.  Only those who are really serious about partying should attend this meetup event.
