Two Conquer artists are performing at Hennessey's on Union St. (Fanueil Hall) from 5-7:30pm -- Mia Boostrom, of two-time America's Got Talent fame, &amp;amp; Ryan McHugh, with a career including regular gigs in the Boston area &amp;amp; beyond as well as a performance for tv's "The Sopranos"! The duo puts on quite a show, playing a range of music including hits across genres like pop, rock &amp;amp; more! No cover &amp;amp; a fun bar that also serves great food! Conquer contact: Nina Pickell, Certified Artist Developer team lead, at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank"&gt;617-513-9631&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a definite fun time! Start your weekend off right with a little bit o' live music, good food and spirits.&amp;nbsp; I should be there around 5:30pm and will try to get a couple of tables up close in front but this place gets a good after work crowd so it will be busy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hennessy's is conveniently located in the Haymarket, easily accessible to the Green, Blue and Orange lines.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO. Don't forget to tip your bartender/server! ;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

NOTE: THIS EVENT IS CROSSLISTED WITH SOCIAL FUN AND RED SOX NATIVES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;
