In this rehearsal, we will master the nuts and bolts of our show. We will go over warm-up routines, introductions, develop the order in which we perform our games, master transitions, and prepare our close. In addition to practicing the games we've learned up until now, we will learn a new game that centers around a single audience member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to construct a performance that will connect with audience members while entertaining everyone involved. In rehearsal, we will work towards projecting an appropriate energy for performing in places of therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we are approaching our first performance (TBD), it is especially important that all regulars attend. Others that have not been attending quite so regularly are, as always, a valued addition to our rehearsal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward,&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244076272000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240040566000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting 7: Developing Our Show</name><id>10211489</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240174800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/10211489/</event_url></item>
