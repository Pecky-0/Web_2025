&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Watatic, with an elevation of 1832 feet, has long been a popular destination for hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts who wish to experience the scenic views that are afforded in all directions from its summit. The Mid-State Trail and Wapack Trail are both long-distance hiking trails that traverse the Reservation propert&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/a/a/event_182873162.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;y. The diversity of ecological features, including the bald summit, rocky outcrops, forested slopes, seeps and wet lowlands, abut additional lands managed by the DCR (a 211-acre block of Ashburnham State Forest) and the Department of Fish and Game (the 150-acre Watatic Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary and the 263-acre Ashby Wildlife Management Area). The abundant wildlife attracts national hiking, birding and conservation groups to the area. The summit is one of the best places in the northeast to view the annual hawk migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at the main parking area on Route 119 and head out on our approximately 3 mile loop hike of Mt Watatic.&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/c/0/event_182872672.jpeg" width="466" height="627" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress appropriately for the weather, and due to hunting season, wearing something bright would be a good idea. And plan for it being colder and windier at the mostly open summit. This hike should take less than 3 hours total.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Terry Rooney</member_name><member_id>43555442</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354471379000</updated><rating><average>4.55999994278</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353886111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Loop hike on Mt Watatic</name><id>92779332</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354374000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group/events/92779332/</event_url></item>
