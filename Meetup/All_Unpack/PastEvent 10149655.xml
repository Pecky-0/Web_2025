<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>These are two lovely wooded walks, one along a river, and the other a little known trail along  the Quabbin reservoir (AKA the Accidental Wilderness).  We will walk for two hrs before lunch along the river then have lunch at the Petersham country store.  After lunch, those who have the stamina will drive another 10 or 15 minutes to the Quabbin for another 1-2 hr walk.  Maybe we'll have dinner after our last excursion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should carpool as it is a long ride and there is limited parking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're planning to have lunch you should call the country store a couple days in advance to order your lunch.  Let them know you are part of the meet-up.  I have arranged for them to create a menu for us to choose from;  it will probably consist of a few kinds of sandwiches.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at parking lot by 108 East St.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will park by the pond at 108 East ST,  Petersham</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim</member_name><member_id>3553414</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241652928000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239248374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PetershamTrustees of Reservations  trail  and Quabbin Reservoir </name><id>10149655</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241276400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10149655/</event_url></item>
