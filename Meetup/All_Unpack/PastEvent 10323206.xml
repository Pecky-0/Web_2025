All friends and family are welcome. Guests are encouraged to bring sports and game gear, and are asked to contribute to the potluck buffet.  (An updated list of what people are bringing will be below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will not be an official speaker or program.  Our main purpose is to network with other New England area freethinkers in a casual, social setting in order to strengthen our community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Greater Worcester Humanists is having a drive to provide school supplies for needy families in the Worcester area. We were told by the staff of the food pantry that recently opened at the UU Church of Worcester that there is a real need for school supplies, and we thought this would be an appropriate need for our group to address. Therefore we'll be taking donated school supplies at this meeting.  Supplies would include: Pencils, colored pencils, pens, markers/crayons, notebooks, loose-leaf paper, crafts supplies, and backpacks. Thanks for helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rutland State Park has more than 300 acres of walking/biking trails and also a pond for swimming. The GWH has reserved the use of the main pavillion for this event. Parking is $5.
