David is right - the two major streets immediately around the track (Powder House Blvd &amp;amp; College Ave) require Permit parking. However, Broadway, going west from Powder House Circle toward Teele Square, requires a Parking Permit only between midnight and 6:00 AM. Double check the signs anyway; there's at least one every block on Broadway.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park your car on Broadway between Powder House Square and Teele Square. Remember to bring a bike lock and running shoes. We'll meet at the bleachers at the track and start the ride from there. The ride is described in this &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/5ut3xn" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map&lt;/a&gt;. When you finish the ride, grab your bike lock &amp;amp; shoes, lock your bike to the track fence, and start running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &amp;quot;go at your own pace&amp;quot; brick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone wants to volunteer as the bike route sweeper, we'd all greatly appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: If you're not driving, you can leave your bike lock &amp;amp; shoes on my porch. I live a block from the track.
