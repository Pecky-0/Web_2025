&lt;p&gt;Each hike will be 5 to 7 miles of moderate hiking over a 3 to 4 hour duration. The group will meet at the end of the trail head and car pool to the beginning. We will then walk back to the cars and make arrangements to pick up the cars that were left at the start. It would be nice to have a group of people who are interested in completing all of the sections. Connecticut Forest and Part awards a patch to those who do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 6 – Rattlesnake Mountain to Pinnacle Rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt; 5.8 miles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrain:&lt;/strong&gt; Cross the fields of the Hill-Stead Museum and then follow the blue blaze along a short distance of road until you reach the base of Rattlesnake Mountain. After Summiting Rattlesnake the trial descends before raising again to a trap rock ledge with several outlooks to the west. Cruse the ridge until you do a quick decent to New Britain Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace:&lt;/strong&gt; A moderate pace with breaks for water and views but the intent is to cover the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; Sunday 10AM EDT 15 July 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting location:&lt;/strong&gt; Parking lot of the business located at 440 New Britain Ave, in Plainville CT. We will split up into car pools and drive to the trail head just off the parking lot located at the dead end of Hill-Stead Museum Road in Farmington CT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who to look for:&lt;/strong&gt; Red Dodge Wagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and Drink:&lt;/strong&gt; A snack and a quart of water. Plans can be discussed for an after hike lunch meeting location during the hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;The Metacomet Trail traverses the traprock Metacomet Ridge which extends from Long Island Sound to the Massachusetts/ Vermont border. This ridge, rising hundreds of feet above the Connecticut River, Farmington River, and Quinnipiac River valleys, is a prominent landscape feature of central Connecticut. From south to north, the trail uses the ridges of the Hanging Hills, Short Mountain, Ragged Mountain, Bradley Mountain, Pinnacle Rock, Rattlesnake Mountain, Farmington Mountain, Talcott Mountain, Hatchet Hill, Peak Mountain, and West Suffield Mountain. Abrupt vertical cliffs with visible talus slopes and frequent viewpoints are common throughout. Views are generally to the west from West Suffield Mountain south through Ragged Mountain; west and south in the Hanging Hills. The Farmington River cuts through the ridgeline between Hatchet Hill and Talcott Mountain in the Tariffville Gorge (east of Simsbury). Historic features along the trail include Old Newgate Prison museum and copper mine in East Granby; Heublein Tower on Talcott Mountain with expansive view of four states; the Hill-Stead museum in Farmington, Connecticut, notable for its French impressionist painting collection and gardens; and Hubbard Park of the Hanging Hills of Meriden, designed with the help of famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead.[1][6][7] The traprock ridges and talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge are also home to several unique microclimate ecosystems that support species of plants that are unusual or endangered in this part of New England, and are a seasonal migration path for raptors.[8] Viewshed from the ledges include agrarian land, suburbs, small towns, river corridors, the eastern Berkshires ridgeline, and metropolitan Meriden and Hartford.&lt;/p&gt;
