<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the suggestion of some folks at our last meetup, I thought it would be good to try for an outdoor meetup next month. I've scheduled it for the last weekend of March, in the afternoon -- the warmest part of the day. Hopefully the weather will cooperate. I also know many folks have emailed me and requested afternoon times for meetup, so hopefully this will allow more people to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless anyone has a suggestion for a reasonable outdoor venue, we're happy to continue hosting at our place (though we can't promise the landscaping will be nice by then!). For new folks who've never been there, we have a large fenced-in backyard, so pups can run around and play without worry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll ask for small donations to cover meetup costs, but unlike our last two meetings when we had to pay the venue, they will not be mandatory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can come! Please remember to RSVP. And, as always, email with any questions or concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;Marianna&lt;br /&gt;(organizer)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241363291000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners and Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernMApugs</urlname><id>1207399</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235670657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Meet-up!</name><id>9830319</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238263200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernMApugs/events/9830319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/c/global_4651788.jpeg</photo_url></item>
