My sister Laurie was in town with her friend Renee - who is the lead singer for a NY rock band - Born of Scars (check them out at www.myspace.com/bornofscars). So ... when we got to O'Brien's for karaoke, (after enjoying the Deck) we had lots of performers in our group. Michael, Mike (don't care what you say - you all  sounded good!), Renee, myself, and even Steve got up and shared our vocal skills. &lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite weekly outings! Hope to see more of you there next week!&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet on the Deck at 7:00, and from there we can listen to the music, watch the sunset, and/or move on from there! &lt;br /&gt;Either way, it's a good way to get some ya-ya's out before its back to work on Monday!&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to call me at 631-433-5223 with questions or comments/suggestions! Keep this number handy 'cause if you're late we may have moved on, and we wouldn't want to leave you behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A PS for those who signed up and didn't make it: Please call if you respond 'yes' and can't attend. We hate to miss people, and we know that some of the members won't recognize us. Again, if you can't find us, or can't make it ... please call! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the bar - or call Mark at 631-433-5223</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>10739343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281958410000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280295431000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Sunsets</name><id>dxvcpynlbtb</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281913200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/14238185/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/b/global_17120123.jpeg</photo_url></item>
