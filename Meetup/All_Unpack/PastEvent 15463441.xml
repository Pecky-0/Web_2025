It has a great beer selection both on draft and in bottles together with a variety of wines and spirits.  Prices are very reasonable.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their private club license does not let them put out a sign, so here are the directions.  The bar is in the basement of a large ugly dorm called the Graduate Center, which is on the west side of Thayer St. between Charlesfield and Power.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk uphill on Power St. (away from Thayer) to the back edge of the building.  Walk down the driveway toward the dumpsters at the end.  Turn right at the dumpsters and enter the door to head down the cinder block corridor.  At the end, enter the student-chic atmosphere that is the GCB.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake the bartender and Susan the manager have been warned that we will be coming.  Tell them you're with Meet-up, and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so you feel more comfortable walking past the dumpsters and down that cinder block corridor, follow this link for a review by other people who have enjoyed GCB:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/17135/?view=beerfly&amp;amp;ba=ThirstyBird" target="_blank"&gt;http://beeradvocate.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If lost, phone the bar at 401-421-0270.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce B</member_name><member_id>11410054</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290792373000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289910701000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Graduate Center Bar</name><id>15463441</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290466800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/15463441/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/b/global_5889099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
