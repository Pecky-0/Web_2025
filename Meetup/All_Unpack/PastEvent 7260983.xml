We have arranged to meet them on Monday, February 18th, for a ride around Peaks Island, where they are staying (weather permitting), followed by a potluck dinner. If you don't have your bike out this time of year, or the weather does not permit a ride, please come anyway! There will be a beach stroll for the non-riders, and everyone's welcome at the pot-luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the itinerary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 PM&lt;/b&gt;: Portland contingent meets (with bikes, if you have them) at Casco Bay Ferry Lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:15 PM&lt;/b&gt;: Ferry departs for Peaks Island&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 PM&lt;/b&gt;: Meet Boston Green-Streeters at top of ferry road (probably have opportunity to drop off your potluck offering somewhere first). Bike ride departs. Non-riders depart for ocean-side stroll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 PM&lt;/b&gt; or whenever riders/walkers return: Potluck dinner at the Inn at Peaks Island, 33 Island Ave, near the top of the ferry road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cascobaylines.com/schedules/winter_peaks.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Ferries back to Portland&lt;/a&gt; leave at 5:00, 6:00, 7:40, 8:40 or 9:40 PM. Round-trip fares are $3.75 for adults and children 10 and above, $1.85 for children 5-9, children under 5 are free, and bikes are $6. You will pay your own ferry fee, but there is no other charge for this meetup, though we do ask that you bring a potluck offering of some sort if possible. &lt;b&gt;Also please bring your own plate(s), cup(s), napkin(s) and utensils.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Note changes from original plans: None of the group will be arriving on Monday as originally thought, and we were not able to arrange a demo of Metro bike racks for that day, so that demo and that of the train station bike racks will be postponed for another day, possibly later this month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at ferry waiting area</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Ride the Peaks Island loop, and eat good food with interesting bike-y people.</why><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202146898000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Green Streets Party</name><id>7260983</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203361200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/7260983/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/8/global_3142520.jpeg</photo_url></item>
