What's on the agenda for this week: Verona, a Czech game due out at Spiel 2010; 20th Century, another Czech game that I'm waiting for rules on in order to play; 40+ Japanese games; whatever else fits in the time we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP with an arrival time if you're in. I'll likely host gaming on other nights this week, too, so let me know other times of availability if you can't make Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And feel to make suggestions on what you want to play. Advance notice is usually good for preparation â€“ not that I've been ready to play Verona the past few times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286901367000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286684949000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>15059912</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286841600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/15059912/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
