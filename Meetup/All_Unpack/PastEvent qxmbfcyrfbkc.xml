Wednesdays after 5 is free at the MFA. We'll repeat this on an-going basis to really take the time to see the many galleries in this new wing. Guests welcome. If you RSVP "yes" that means you will be attending. You can always change your RSVP if your plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary art finds a dynamic new home at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, when the Museum unveils to the public the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, located in the MFA’s dramatic I. M. Pei-designed building. The transformed wing features seven galleries introducing innovative approaches to contemporary art within the context of the Museum’s collections, offering new perspectives and encouraging connections between art of the past and present. Art is displayed throughout the wing, including in the Henry and Lois Foster Gallery, where the exhibition "Ellsworth Kelly: Wood Sculpture," the first museum survey of wood sculpture by the acclaimed artist Ellsworth Kelly, debuts September 18. And don't miss the 24-hour screenings of Christian Marclay's The Clock in Loring Gallery 276.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet near the Members Table in the Main Information Center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Q.</member_name><member_id>2269958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364434820000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318498227000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Wednesday at the MFA</name><id>qxmbfcyrfbkc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364423400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/106728092/</event_url></item>
