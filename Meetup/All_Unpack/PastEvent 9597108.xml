Lavish and eclectic, Art Deco geometric shapes conjure images of a streamlined technological age reflected in the emergence of skyscrapers, aviation and telecommunications through the 1920's and 1930's. While many look to other cities like New York and Miami for Art Deco in architecture, Boston retains a rich collection and some of the finest examples in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Batterymarch building through to the Paramount Theater, join us on this walk and discover many hidden treasures in Boston's financial district on this Boston By Foot tour of downtown architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guided walking &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Art_Deco" target="_blank"&gt;tour of Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; leaves from Angell Memorial Park in Post Office Square (near the corner of Milk &amp;amp; Congress Streets) at 2pm. This tour is $15 ($5 for &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot card holders&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tour was offered last year and was very well received. One of our members made this comment: &lt;i&gt; &amp;quot;It was amazing! It was hard to believe that I'd walked by those buildings dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and had never noticed the details until the tour. I learned a lot. And now whenever I'm in town I'll be sure to look up, so I don't miss anything. It was great, and I'm glad I went.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find guides with Boston By Foot signs and buttons in Angell Park.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240151389000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232901629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art Deco in Boston</name><id>9597108</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239559200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/9597108/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/5/0/global_4708432.jpeg</photo_url></item>
