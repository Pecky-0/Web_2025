Rock Bottom Brewery has really good food and reasonable prices. Nick's is located at 100 Warrenton Street - just a short walk from the restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have free admission at Nick's (tix are usually $20 each). We will be meeting for dinner at 6:30. Doors open at Nick's at 8pm- show starts at 8:30. We should be there early to get good seats. If you just want to join us for the comedy show and not dinner, please specify that in your RSVP. The reservation at Nick's is under the name Catherine.
