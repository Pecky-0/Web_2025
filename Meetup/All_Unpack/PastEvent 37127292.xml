It's high time I hosted another meetup!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose to do it the Sunday before Halloween because it's my favorite holiday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COSTUMES REQUIRED!!!! There will be a small contest for Scariest, Most Creative and Best Overall Costumes. I'm not a rich person but I will get creative will prizes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For food..... You know how much I love to cook!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will make a pasta dish, a meaty type appetizer and a vegetarian appetizer also. I plan to make cupcakes, hand molded chocolate treats and possibly a jello mold for desserty things.&amp;nbsp; I have a Mock-Tail punch recipe I'll&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;and some other sodas and juices. If you want to drink alcohol&amp;nbsp;this will be a BYOB event and I ask that whatever you don't finish you please take home with you as I am&amp;nbsp;staying sober&amp;nbsp;lately. (Seriously I really quit drinking if you can believe it! &lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/981263258369601089/img/smileys/smile.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that if anyone has a great recipe they would like to make, or a snack&amp;nbsp;you'd like to bring, please do so. For those of you who are culinary challenged and want to contribute, don't worry about it....bring and couple bucks and throw it in my meetup collection pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you planning on bringing something, PLEASE make a public note here so others know not to bring the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Friend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dollar (to help support the website fees)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Smile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DON'T FORGET COSTUMES ARE MANDATORY!!!!!!! (I even got one for the dog!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog Alert...I have a very friendly Besenji and she will be out for the event. She is hypoallergenic and cannot bark. But&amp;nbsp;be warned, she sits on the couches like a person and loves people to pet her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is on the cross street, Englewood Ave or somewhere on my lawn if there is space. DO NOT park on my street Packard....cars drive by WAY too fast there and will take off your mirror! It's happened before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about all I can think of, contact me for anything else!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Mustard yellow house directly across from Englewood Ave</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nina</member_name><member_id>4895998</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320724947000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318438345000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Halloween Games Night</name><id>37127292</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320616800000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/37127292/</event_url></item>
