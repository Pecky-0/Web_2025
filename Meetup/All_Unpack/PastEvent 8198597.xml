It is a beautiful blend of traditional Christian symbols and esoteric Gnostic meaning. Membership is not required to attend or take part in the liturgy, so please come visit, and participate if you feel moved to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Liturgy for this weekend is for the Renewal of Spirit. We'll hear a real juicy esoteric reading from Simon Magus about the role of the body and the spirit. The Gospel is from my favorite of the Apocrypha, the Gospel of Philip, and addresses the need to find the Light while we're here. There will be lots to think about and plenty to learn. You don't want to miss this!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk in the front door of the building and straight down the hall</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
