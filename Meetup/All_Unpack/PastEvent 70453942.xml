We will be covering topics which include How fashion and music pros can work together to sell each other's products-How do you figure out which demographic to target in relationship to selling fashion designs/merchandise and music-How do you determine the best designs and music that will work well together to increase sales, customers, and grow a fan base.&lt;/p&gt;
