[b]Update[/b]

7:30 is the time for the movie.  I will be wearing my red meetup hat, and I will be in the theater lobby at 7:00. I'll send some folks into the movie theater about 15 minutes before showtime to get us some seats. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables at the front of the lobby in front of the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, I will be just behind the ropes across from the concession stand. If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" delves into the origins of the centuries-old blood feud between the aristocratic vampires, known as Death Dealers, and the barbaric Lycans (werewolves). A young Lycan, Lucian (Michael Sheen), emerges as a powerful leader who rallies the werewolves to rise up against Viktor (Bill Nighy), the cruel vampire king who has persecuted them for hundreds of years. Lucian is joined by his secret lover, the beautiful vampire Sonja (Rhona Mitra), in his battle to free the Lycans from their brutal enslavement.
