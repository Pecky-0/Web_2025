Understand and accept what has been, what lessons you've learned and the positive things that are part of your history. Let things be as they are and value the unique person you are and have been. Most people have challenges, painful experiences and some regrets. Accept that as normal and we'll look at ways to let go of the painful feelings associated with your past and how to be in the present, ok with your past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional cost $40, sliding scale to $20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 to 9:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce is a relationship coach, therapist, workshop leader and organizational trainer.
