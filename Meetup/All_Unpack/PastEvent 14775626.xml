We are going to have lots of fun with some new games that will really allow you to surprise yourselves in your improv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember there's no experience required, so if you have yet to attend, make this your first!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions?  Let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on over and head to my backyard, I'm going to try to hook up some awesome lighting this week too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  If you are interested in perhaps performing with an improv group on a regular basis, send me an email.  We are audition people for Laughing Matter which is a group I direct who performs at Rehab Centers, Homeless Shelters, Retirement Homes, and the like.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Room through the door to the left.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284823056000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284523145000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Resident Improv: AfterDing</name><id>14775626</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284679800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/14775626/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
