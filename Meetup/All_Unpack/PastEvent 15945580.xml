Are you frustrated because you have already tried many approaches that produce immediate results, but don't last? You are not alone. Qigong presents a sustainable and self-directed approach. Instead inhibiting your dietary needs, Qigong practice cultivates knowledge of who you are and how your body works. This knowledge reveals how the body regulates itself so you gain the power to control your health and weight. Through simple daily exercises you can improve the rate of digestion, increase metabolism, and promote weight loss.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erik  harris</member_name><member_id>10967674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296571664000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294338499000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>QI Gong for weight loss </name><id>15945580</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296280800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/15945580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/a/global_11136970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
