Not to be confused with a rally, a cotillion, or a members-only salon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be August's social event; a more focused evening revolving around a discussion of what atheism and human rights will be announced for earlier in the month as details are firmed up. If you have suggestions on topic, format, or a speaker guest, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available on the street and in nearby lots. Boston Beer Works is easily accessible by trolly or bus. The Sox are away this night, so I don't anticipate the sort of congestion we've had to deal with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1121719964000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Atheists in August</name><id>4737018</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1124233200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/4737018/</event_url></item>
