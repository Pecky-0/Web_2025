Opt to take public transportation if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at 7pm on the football field at Russell Field which is located right next to Alewife Station. We generally play from 7 to 9:30 and then go out for food and drinks. Before attending our events, please review our &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about"&gt;About Us page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bostonfrisbee.com/images/russell.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes if it's a wet day. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face. :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, frisbee batteries, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/IRMLHWE8OGKZ"&gt;Amazon Wishlist&lt;/a&gt; to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your non-obligatory donations are certainly appreciated! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bostonfrisbee.com/images/russell_sat.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;time=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;ttype=&amp;amp;q=russell+field+park,+cambridge+ma&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=43.565393,80.15625&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.399376,-71.137376&amp;amp;spn=0.009951,0.019569&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;om=0"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see a full Google map of the area.
