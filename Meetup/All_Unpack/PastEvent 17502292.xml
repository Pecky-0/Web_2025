This      game is intended to be approximately Yankee C level  or   equivalent.      Players are required to know how to play a 6-2 and  5-1    formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSTRUCTIONS: Because this game requires players to know      formations, the    RSVP procedure is a little different. If you'd like      to play, please  do   the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Send an email to me using the    following URL: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=4774008" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=4774008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the   email, confirm that you know how to play in a 5-1 or 6-2       offense, and   mention your preferred position (if any). 2. Players   will     be added to   the list to fill up positions. Preference is   given to     Yankee C or above   players (or equivalent), and people who   have not     been no-shows at   previous meetups. There is a strict  cap  at 12  players    to make sure   everyone gets lots of playing  time.  Note that  sending   an  email does not   guarantee a spot to  play;  spots are only   guaranteed  if  you are assigned  a  Yes RSVP.   The  cost of the meetup   will be $5.   Please pay the  organizer  when  you  arrive before the   meetup starts.  The  money goes to  cover the   cost  of the court rental.    The entrance  to  the gym is on  Cambridge    Street opposite Harvard   Market. The  nearest  intersection to  the   entrance  is Cambridge Street   and Roberts  Road. The  nearest T stop    is Harvard  Square. The gym is   about a ten  minute walk  from the T   stop.   Parking  near the school  on  Sundays is  generally easy  to   find, as  meters and  residential   parking rules are  generally not    enforced on  Sundays (parking  signs   should say "EX  SUNDAY" or   similar).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304882541000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304284602000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Advanced Indoor Volleyball</name><id>17502292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304877600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/17502292/</event_url></item>
