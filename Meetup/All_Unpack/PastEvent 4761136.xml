With a moderate understanding of how to audit PHP code, you can vastly improve the security of your team's PHP applications. This talk explains the art of the PHP security audit.  Using practical examples, you are shown how to search for common pitfalls, how to identify filtering and escaping errors, and how to report your findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, after any healthy technical discussion food &amp;amp; drink must follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting at Optaros,  a venture backed consulting firm that leverages the benefits of Open Source Software for its clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optaros is located at  60 Canal Street  - next to TD Banknorth Garden so there's plenty of nearby parking and access via the Green and Orange Line.  There are no Garden events scheduled for the 6th, however, you might want to double check ( &lt;a href="http://www.tdbanknorthgarden.com/calendar_m.asp?month=10&amp;amp;year=2005" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tdbanknort...&lt;/a&gt; ) as the day gets closer so you can plan accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.BostonPHP.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1126222386000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP Meetup October Meetup</name><id>4761136</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1128637800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/4761136/</event_url></item>
