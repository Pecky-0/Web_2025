This event is part photo romp, part photoshop play date as we will stroll Newbury street and the area nearby and take series photos that we will later use photoshop's photo merge feature to 'stitch' together and marvel at the often unexpected results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resulting images can be quite large so bring a blank DVD or other Mass Storage device to take your creation home with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Digital Lounge, take a stroll around the block and meet at 5 PM - 8PM to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that this is on Mothers Day, and may move it a week earlier - please comment when you RSVP if you would prefer this be a week earlier or on a Saturday. I'll try to accommodate as many folks as possible within reason :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS $3 Lounge Tip includes 20 oz soda,&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have the place to ourselves!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243810415000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239714653000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Creative Panoramas</name><id>10181929</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243197000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/10181929/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/5/global_8150885.jpeg</photo_url></item>
