I've found the run from the Fiedler footbridge, down to and across Arsenal St, up the Cambridge side of the river, and back over the Mass Ave bridge to Fiedler to be a nice route, but I'm flexible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week's schedule has me doing 12mi and I've been keeping about a 10 min pace of late, feel free to add on or subtract miles as you wish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers,&lt;br /&gt;jess&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>9807882</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252358026000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251829820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Late Afternoon Long Slow Distance Run</name><id>11259435</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252184400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/11259435/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
