We are going to make a day of it but you can pick any ferry you want to leave on. Go to blockislandferryschedule.com Look at the traditional ferry schedule. If you feel a need for speed you can take the fast ferry. The site says they always have traditional ferry tickets available day of but I have found if you buy them ahead on line the wait is shorter. The rate is $20.75 RT for you and $6.40 for your bike. We are planning a go with the flow day! We will ride, enjoy the view, ride, eat lunch, ride. Our thought is to end the day with cocktails at Ballards. Ferrys go back at 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 PM. Bring your suncreen, your bike and a laid back attitude! Hope you can all make this! I will look for a place as a possbile breakfast meeting before we board the ferry if folks are interested! The meetup is listed as 8 am, the ferry leaves at 8. Be there by 7:30 am!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Solange Morrissette</member_name><member_id>13231478</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342998744000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339453381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ride Block Island</name><id>68748602</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342872000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/68748602/</event_url></item>
