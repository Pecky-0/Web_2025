It's their yearly Halloween edition (Came out Nov 1 - go figure): Monster Mayhem! We'll have this meeting in the Borders Bookstore Cafe in Providence Place Mall this coming Thursday. Borders sells SI magazine - so if anyone wants a copy of it, it will be right there to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have a laptop opened with the RI Skeptics Facebook logo displayed on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a busy month and I'm now trying to get back into the swing of doing this twice a month or so. With luck we can have one or two more meetings before the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a laptop opened with the RI Skeptics Facebook logo displayed on it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>paul ruggeri</member_name><member_id>6360030</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290130675000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Skeptics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>skeptics-133</urlname><id>357970</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Skeptics Society</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289759295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skeptics in the Coffee Shop - EMERGENCY MEETING!!!!
