I'm looking forward to the new season - to seeing long-time members and meeting new ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a great theatre season in RI, with classics like Camelot, West Side Story, South Pacific coming to town. Honestly, I could use some Lerner &amp;amp; Loewe after all the avant garde plays we saw last season! But if 1950s musicals aren't your thing, there are plenty of other interesting plays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To kick off the season, we'll have an informal get-together at &lt;a href="http://www.trinitybrewhouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trinity Brewhouse&lt;/a&gt;, starting at &lt;b&gt;7 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; You pay for your own dinner and drinks - the stimulating conversation is free. I will also be asking for our annual $7 membership fee. Thanks to those who already paid in the spring, I won't hit you up again until next year. ;-) Everyone is welcome, whether you've just joined or you come to every Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Nicole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask at hostess stand for RI Theatre Group</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284313788000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281881792000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Start-of-season Meetup</name><id>14427450</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284246000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/14427450/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/5/global_12093749.jpeg</photo_url></item>
