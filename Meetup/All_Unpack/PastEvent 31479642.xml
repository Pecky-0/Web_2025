<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Sandy has graciously offered to host a game night at the function room of The Essex. Please meet at the front door of The Essex condo (11 Church St, Salem - across from what some folks call "the Almy's parking lot" - you'll see the green awning) and then Sandy will take everyone downstairs to the Essex Room. Those who arrive later will need to call Sandy to get in (978-219-9292). Her number/directions will be posted on the front door. The on-street and metered lot parking is free in the evening. Please bring your favorite games to play. Sandy will have a few (Luck of the Draw, Fluxx, Uno, Cribbage, Yahtzee, and several decks of cards). Nearby the function room, there is a rec area with a pool table and ping pong table that can accommodate a few players. Beverages available, but feel free to bring snacks to share.
