Details (such as lunch) may change depending on the group's feelings but the route will remain the same more or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for a beautiful ride through Cape Ann that will showcase the rugged coastlines of Magnolia and Gloucester and the pastoral horse farms of central Essex.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving from the Balch street entrances of the Cummings center in Beverly we'll wind our way through Beverly farms over to 127, north through Manchester-by-the-sea and Magnolia past Hammond Castle to Gloucester and the magnificent shoreline and homes of Eastern Point.  Heading west after that we'll get into some of the most beautiful and quiet country roads the North Shore has to offer with a stop at JT Farnham's in Essex for an al fresco lunch overlooking the scenic Essex river and surrounding marsh.  Then it's back in the saddle for more bucolic farm vistas and country lanes.  A quick detour through Bradley Palmer State Park and a skirt of the Massachusetts Audubon Sanctuary brings us back to 97 and a 6 mile ride back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 50 miles in total.   I'll be planning on doing this in about 5-6 hours (depending on the length and frequency of stops) finishing with an average riding pace of about 13mph.  Usually I like to start earlier than this (say 8am) but I thought I might be the only one.  If however there is interest in avoiding some of the heat of the day we can make adjustments depending on travel arrangements of members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to bring:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul type="1" class="fakeOL"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bike (road or hybrid) and helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A spare tube and patch kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Water or sports drink and plenty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Money for lunch, water, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cummings Center is located on route 62 (Elliot street) in Beverly and is about a 5 min pedal north of the Beverly commuter rail station.  The route map is below cue is available in the group files under the 'more' menu above.
