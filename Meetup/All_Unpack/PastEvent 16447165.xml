This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Apartment - the Jewelry District's newest locale, near Olga's Cup &amp;amp; Saucer and across the street from Rick's Roadhouse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might have been there already on the Doc's last crawl and the reviews have been been great from various sources. It has a great name, its cute and comfortable and I also understand that the beer selection is pretty good as well, so what's not to like! And its open on Monday night! If you've been and you loved it, you know all you need is a reason to go again, and if you haven't, let's check it out!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
