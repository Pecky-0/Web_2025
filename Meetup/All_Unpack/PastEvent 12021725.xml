<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Dear Members,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup is open to all current members of Laughing Matter. Newly-joined members will support the existing group as it prepares its upcoming shows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Existing members will learn and practice the games that comprise the group's show repertoire. Warmups will drill listening, as during last rehearsal, and will work to stretch the group's character range. Newly-joined members will participate in drill and scene-based warmups and play the interactive role of &amp;quot;audience members.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the tail end of rehearsal, we will discuss cast assignments, anticipated performance schedule, and the organization's first fundraising drive. More information on these subjects will follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come rested, energized, and improvised for a hard-hitting rehearsal. Also, please think about and mentally rehearse the concepts learned up until this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you next week!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259986362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Rehearsal - Training 4</name><id>12021725</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260577800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/12021725/</event_url></item>
