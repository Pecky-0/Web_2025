<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Greetings!&lt;br /&gt;The turning of the wheel now brings us to Lughnasadh (LOO-nus-uh), also known by its medieval Christian name of Lammas, named in honor of the Celtic god Lugh, a name which means “light” or “shining.” Lughnasadh is the first of the three harvest Sabbats, Mabon and Samhain being the other two, which celebrates the ripening grains and corn. This time of the year finds us with fields to harvest, the first of a bountiful crop that will hold us through the winter months. Even though the hottest days of summer are upon us, we have but to look to see that fall is just around the corner. Shadows are growing longer as the days slowly become shorter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start the festivities with a pot-luck cookout at Hedgehog Park 53 Lowell Road, Salem, NH 03079 from 1-5. The park provides space for outdoor activities and a small beach for swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Open Circle will be at the UU Church of Haverhill as always and will start at 6PM. Please bring harvest-appropriate snacks for Cakes &amp;amp; Ale and donations for the church as you are able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no class this week.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249854692000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237305047000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Lughnasadh</name><id>9972998</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249232400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9972998/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
