&lt;p&gt;The Head Pond Rail Trail in Hooksett is a flat, wide trail most of the way. . There are a few places along the way the dogs can access the water. There is a pond at the turn around point where the dogs can swim.  As this is a line hike (you come back the exact same way) on a easy to follow mostly straight trail any one getting  tired before we reach the turn around point can easily find their way back to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware that the third house down the trail has 2 vicious dogs with an electric fence but they can reach within 10 feet of the trail.  Fortunately that house is very near the start of the hike and won't take long to get past if the dogs are outside. Simply staying to the left on the trail with your dog should take care of that when you first pass that house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
