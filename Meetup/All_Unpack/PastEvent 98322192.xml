&lt;p&gt;Since May, there has been a regular walk around Fresh Pond at about an hour before sunset. Frequently, 20-25 walkers turn out for this walk, and you can too. There are a whole bunch of regulars, along with some new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently, if we eat too much food, we'll go for another walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come see why this walk is so popular. It's at a great time, the people are friendly, the parking is free -- no permit parking in Cambridge on Sunday, so you can park on Huron or Aberdeen Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get there by T easily from Harvard Square, take the 71 OR 73 bus to Aberdeen Ave, then walk to the other end of Aberdeen Ave, and you'll see us there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're late, and we've already started, start walking counter-clockwise. We'll be walking clockwise, so we'll surely bump into each other. We're the large group of vigorously chatting walkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll all go out for dinner afterwards, somewhere in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron R.</member_name><member_id>4515948</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358127043000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357539175000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Regular Sunday walk around Fresh Pond followed by food and drink at TBA</name><id>98322192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358109000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/98322192/</event_url></item>
