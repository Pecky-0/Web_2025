Charlie literally wrote the book on Technical Analysis (one of them, anyway).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout his 42 years in the investment field, the national media and his peers have recognized Charles D. Kirkpatrick II. He has been featured on Wall $treet Week, CNBC, and in the magazine Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities, has been quoted in such publications as the Wall Street Journal, Businessweek, Forbes, Futures Magazine, Money Magazine and the New York Times, and has written articles for Barron’s and the Journal of Technical Analysis. He is the only person to win the annual Charles H. Dow Award twice, for articles on technical analysis in 1993 and 2001. The Market Technicians Association, Dow Jones Newswire, Bridge Information Systems, and Barron’s jointly sponsor the Charles H. Dow award. In 2008, he won the MTA Annual Award “for Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Technical Analysis.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been a featured speaker before such professional organizations as the New York Society of Security Analysts, Financial Analysts Federation, Market Technicians Association and the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, and he is mentioned in Who’s Who in Industry and Finance as well as other professional biographical publications. He is a Chartered Market Technician, a past elected Board Member of the Market Technicians Association (www.mta.org), past editor of their Journal of Technical Analysis, Chairman of their Academic Liaison Committee, responsible for the development of courses in technical analysis at major business schools.  He currently spends much of his time as Director of the Market Technicians Association Educational Foundation (www.mtaef.org) developing courses in technical analysis for colleges and universities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After serving as a combat decorated officer with the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, Mr. Kirkpatrick began his career with the investment advisory division of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp;amp; Co. managing the Harriman family accounts. He later moved to the Tabell Group at Walston &amp;amp; Co. where he assisted in the origination of an extensive historical database on the stock market and in the creation of one of Wall Street’s first block trading desks. He then joined the Arthur Lipper Corporation where he originated a number of notable studies on individual stock price patterns, relative price strength and earnings growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1970 Mr. Kirkpatrick co-founded the Market Forecasting division of Lynch, Jones &amp;amp; Ryan and in 1978 his own market forecasting and brokerage firm, Kirkpatrick &amp;amp; Company, Inc., which published an investment-strategy letter, provided computerized stock-selection methods to institutional portfolio managers, managed a hedge fund, and traded options on the PHLX and CBOE. While currently retired from the investment management, brokerage and trading businesses, he continues to publish his Market Strategist letter, to calculate his award-winning stock-selection lists, to lecture to investment classes at colleges and universities throughout the country, and beginning in the fall of 2009 to teach a credit course in technical analysis at Brandeis University's graduate school of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard College (AB), and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (MBA), Mr. Kirkpatrick lives in Kittery, Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets during the hour from 5:30 PM to 6:50 PM.
