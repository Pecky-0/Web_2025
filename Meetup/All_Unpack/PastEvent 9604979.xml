Imbolc is the Awakening of the light, when the first signs of new growth begin to appear, and the plans for the new year are laid. Seed catalogs are purchased, and farmers ready to sow their crops when the time comes. Animals prepare to bring forth life in their turn. The first Awakening is the awakening to the possibilities of the new year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no class this week&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Back of Church, upstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234027153000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232996036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Imbolc Celebration - Open Circle</name><id>9604979</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233532800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9604979/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
