<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I discovered this historic, hidden gem from another MeetUp group when I went geocaching in the area with my dog. This place is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;The quarry which was in operation for nearly a century, very suddenly ceased operations about 45+ years ago. It's as if all the humans had suddenly disappeared and never came back. Left behind is the equipment, remains of buildings, machinery, trucks, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great web of hiking trails, many marked with educational information for a self-guided walking tour.&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are allowed, but should be under voice control and/or leash (preferably) at all times.&lt;br /&gt;If going, be sure to bring your camera, comfortable hiking shoes or boots, water and snacks (for both you and your dog). Please be a responsible owner and bring at least a couple bags for your doggy's &amp;quot;business&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Hike should last about 2 to 3 hours depending on number of stops and trails taken.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Mass. Pike to Westfield Exit 3. Right out of tolls onto Rtes. 10/202 south. In downtown Westfield, right onto Franklin Street/Rte. 20 West. Quarry road is on LEFT approx. 3 miles from the Chester Fire Dept. (immediately after Wade Inn Road which will be on your right). Follow Quarry Road south/southwest for roughly 1.5 mile or so passing Gould Road on left. Quarry entrance will be on left a very short distance after that. For APPROXIMATE GPS/Nav systems, enter &amp;quot;500 Quarry Road, Becket, MA&amp;quot;  For you geocachers use coordinates: Lat: 42 degrees 15' 05&amp;quot; N and Long: 73 degrees 01' 12&amp;quot; W&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have the gold Subaru Outback and a black lab'.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>7131280</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241879436000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240591687000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Historic Becket Quarry Dog Friendly MeetUp hike</name><id>10259563</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241362800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/10259563/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/0/global_8312432.jpeg</photo_url></item>
