This is supposed to be one of the best haunted houses in the area, they work with theme park companies in Orlando and have real horror movie actors....so hopefully it will be scary! If you go to the site at &lt;a href="http://www.factoryofterror.com/main.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.factoryoft...&lt;/a&gt; you can print a coupon so its only 15 bucks. They don't take cards so make sure you bring cash (There is an ATM across the street). Parking is free at the garage located on Pearl and Anwan. As it gets closer we can figure out car pooling so not everyone has to drive (only half an hour from Newport). We can do an optional drink after to calm our nerves.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll arrange car pooling as it gets closer and meet at the entrance.
