Screenplay by Jean-Paul Rappeneau. Director of photography, Pierre Lhomme. Cast: Romy Schneider, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Henri Serre. The most exciting discovery of the fall is a rarely seen (in the States) gem from France's visionary New Wave. With a restoration overseen by cinematographer Pierre Lhomme (Army of Shadows, King of Hearts, Camille Claudel), every frame is a revelation. Three great actors star in a personal/political thriller that reflects the growing changes in France after the Algerian War. Romy Schneider is the impossibly beautiful wife of a factory owner's son, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant (The Conformist). However, their relationship is under attack both by Trintignant's secret right wing activities, and Schneider's growing attraction for her husband√≠s friend - a left wing printer played by Henri Serre (Jules and Jim). &amp;quot;NOT TO BE MISSED! Cavalier's beautifully crafted thriller stars three of the most accomplished actors of European cinema at their absolute peak here.&amp;quot; Elliott Stein, Village Voice. 104 min.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the lobby, with glasses and a smile.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253231642000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251772896000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Le Combat Dans L'ILe</name><id>11253762</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252884600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/11253762/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
