Their duo is called "West and Jackson" and will play jazz guitar selections. There is a $10 admission charge which includes tea, pastries, and music. The performance lasts 1 hour so plan to get there a little bit early so we can sit together and enjoy the whole show. Here is more info: &lt;a href="http://www.pphmuseum.org/tea.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pphmuseum....&lt;/a&gt; Sounds like a wonderful summer afternoon event in a beautiful setting.
