WE WON'T RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT THEN! WE MUST ORDER AS A GROUP TO GET THIS PRICE.***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start the evening by having dinner at The Green Elephant at 608 Congress St., Portland at 5pm.  After dinner we will head to the theater for the show. If you can't make it to dinner, please contact me in advance to make other arrangements to meet us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.greenelephantmaine.com/images/logo.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phew! This is the most complicated meetup I've organized so far, so please read the details below carefully!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. We will receive a group rate for this event if we have a minimum of 10 people.&lt;/b&gt; The rates are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0-10 people (confirmed and paid) - $28.00&lt;br /&gt;10-50 people (confirmed and paid) - $23.75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including PayPal fees and the meetup fee of $1, the total amount due will be &lt;b&gt;$25.80&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a minimum of 10 people can attend, we will receive a savings of $4.25, or 15% per ticket. Not bad considering we only need 10 people~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. This meetup requires 10 confirmed and paid participants. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Upon RSVPing Yes, you will need to pay online for this event through PayPal.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including PayPal fees and the meetup fee of $1, the total amount due will be &lt;b&gt;$25.80&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to make payments directly to Portland Stage Company in order to receive the discount. I have to put 20% down to hold the seats, and a final head count and final payment must be made 2 weeks prior to the performance date. At that time ALL sales become final.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To make this work, the following rules apply:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You may RSVP yes up until November 8th.&lt;br /&gt;2. All payments MUST be received by November 8th.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you have RSVP'd yes, but NOT made payment by November 8th, you will be excluded from this event.&lt;br /&gt;4. 4. Tickets are being sold on a first come first serve basis, which means the tickets may all be sold &lt;b&gt;BEFORE&lt;/b&gt; the deadline. There are 20 tickets total for this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;REFUNDS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refunds will only be issued if the event is canceled, or the member cancels their attendance by November 7th, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet for dinner at 5pm at the Green Elephant at 608 Congress St. After dinner we will head to the theater for the show.
