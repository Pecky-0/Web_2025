They have taken on a lot of customers and teachers from the recently departed Sparks Craft Studio. You can bring snacks and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;Just bring whatever project you are currently working on. No need to buy anything, but if you need supplies, they have a variety for sale.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241272136000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234643835000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup at Abeille in Brookline </name><id>9742363</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238342400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/9742363/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/e/global_5889278.jpeg</photo_url></item>
