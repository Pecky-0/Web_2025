Audio guides available: add $5 (adult), $4 (senior, child, member). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Exhibit opens to the public Sunday, October 25. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;Purchase Tickets&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://store.mos.org/?action=showevent;event_id=530" target="_blank"&gt;https://store.mos.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Event details: 617-589-0180, 617-589-0417 (TTY), 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. daily&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking that we could grab a few big tables in the food court of the Museum of Science starting at 10:00 am. I'll throw a few red MEETUP table tents on the table we grab so people could find us. It seems like tickets are selling out fast for this day. For example, as of 9/8/2009 from 10:00 am to 11:00 am slot only the 10:20 am, 10:25 am, 10:40 am, and 10:50 am and 10:55 am slot is open. We could hang out briefly and group up with the people in the same time slot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it should take an hour or so to browse the entire show. With so many people split up into different groups, it might be difficult to plan anything after. Let's see what happens...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. He managed to get the 10:45 am timeslot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More about the Harry Potter exhibition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;We want you to get the most out of your experience in the exhibit, so please be aware of the following restrictions when planning your visit: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When ordering tickets, keep in mind that there are no refunds or exchanges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Photography, filming, or recording of any kind are not permitted in the exhibit.
