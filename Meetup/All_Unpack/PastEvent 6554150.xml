The marshland of phragmites and the small lake attract over 100 species of birds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trail goes around Kendrick Pond (also called Cutler Pond). A new trail extends from the pond trail and goes to Powell's Island canoe landing, doubles back and goes under the MBTA commuter rail and out to the Great Plain. From here a hiker has two choices. A right turn leads to a boardwalk through a cattail marsh and ends up on Needham Street in Dedham. A left turn leads down the wide path alongside the elevated railroad line all the way to the Charles River. Directly across is Millennium Park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a snowfall the area becomes a fairyland for cross-country skiing. In summer, there's hiking, canoeing, and fishing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HISTORY: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marshlands, created by flooding from the Newton Upper Falls Silk Dam, have been used for pasturelands for hundreds of years. The marshes were tapped from the late 1800s as watershed well sites. You can see remains of filtering ponds, ditches, and waterworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This park is described in the AMC Massachusetts Trail Guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A portion of the park has been designated as a &amp;quot;core habitat&amp;quot; by the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species program. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193756732000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192472555000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CUTLER PARK NEEDHAM</name><id>6554150</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193583600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/6554150/</event_url></item>
