(licquer store at the intersection too)&lt;br /&gt;Will see a picknick area on left go a bit further apx 0.5 miles to the access right before the bridge on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From I-384, follow rte 6 to toward Willimantic. &lt;br /&gt;6 and 66 will intersect at a light. Take a left on to 6. &lt;br /&gt;Follow this highway to the second exit, go straight (=rte633 or s. frontage rd.) it is actually a parallel to rte 6 connector to rte 195, &lt;br /&gt;Signs for UCONN should be there somewhere too, &lt;br /&gt;Go North on rte 195 toward UCONN for about 2 miles then turn right at the onto Basset Bridge Rd, same info from here as above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available Kayaks are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Brown Bathtub= Pungo 12'= Kathy~g&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Flipper= Riot Tourlite 15'=  AL-r&lt;br /&gt;The Yellow Bananna= Cobra Expidition SOT 18', includes Paddle Pants= Alex&lt;br /&gt;The Red Eddyliner= Eddyline Wind Dancer 18'= Bill&lt;br /&gt;The Red Greenland= NDK Greenlander Pro 18'=  Lori&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Hotub= Canoe 18' this one can hold 3 people pretty easily..maybe more..= Jill and Guest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa J will have her kayak loaded on trailer too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant rent to maybe's&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have the Blue Toyota Avalon with the Kayak Trailer and look for the ORANGE CONES with reflective stripes on them</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AL-r</member_name><member_id>2711041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214762844000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Its a nice day and this is a good place for paddling and a Pot luck Barbie Q just one drive way away.</why><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212513024000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mansfield Hollow Paddling Event Meet at Boat Launch/Parking lot Area</name><id>8069772</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212940800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/8069772/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/3/global_2851763.jpeg</photo_url></item>
