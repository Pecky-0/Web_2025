&lt;p&gt;Whitehall is a gem with a tree-lined shoreline and lots of coves and islands.&amp;nbsp; Power boat traffic is minimal (mostly fishing) and the place is big enough to explore for hours.&amp;nbsp; It is a MA state park, but parking is free in a large lot.&amp;nbsp; If you rely on your GPS to find the park, beware, as it will take you to the opposite end of the lake.&amp;nbsp; For your address, use Dale Street, Hopkinton, since it is the nearest road, just to the west of the entrance to the parking lot.&amp;nbsp; Expect to spend 2- 3 hours exploring the lake.&amp;nbsp; RSVP "yes" only.&lt;/p&gt;
