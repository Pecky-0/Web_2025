Bring your signs and banners (so will we), and let's get a crowd outside that just can't be ignored.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll cheer outside from 4pm until 6:30pm, and then retire to Murphy's Taproom at 494 Elm Street to watch the debate (from 7pm to 9pm).  After about an hour charming the press, Dr. Paul will join us--so expect him around 10pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rally Details:&lt;br /&gt;*We will have signs--bring them if you've got them, but don't worry if you don't.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try to carpool to St. Anselm as parking will be very tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Campaign supporters will have a designated rally area in the parking lot in front of Joan of Arc Residence Hall.  That parking lot is in sightline of the Sullivan Arena.  The earliest supporters can arrive is 4:00 p.m. on debate day.  All signs must be carried in and carried out.  No 4' by 8' signs will be permitted.  No signs allowed/staked in the ground -- including along Saint Anselm Drive.  No blow horns, bands, loudspeakers, audio systems will be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, enthusiasm is still permitted.  So come on out and give Dr. Paul a hero's welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181340203000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>20</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>130</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177943207000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rally at the Debate and meet Dr. Paul!</name><id>5724620</id><headcount>200</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181073600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/5724620/</event_url></item>
