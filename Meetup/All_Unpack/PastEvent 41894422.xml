On December 16, 2007, Ron Paul supporters raised a record $6 Million Dollars for Ron Paul ! They beat their previous one day online record of over $4 Million set just one month earlier on November 5, 2007. &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/DKZmIzEMUN8" target="_blank"&gt;http://youtu.be/DKZmI...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/idICPVftzi0" target="_blank"&gt;http://youtu.be/idICP...&lt;/a&gt; This year, make this an early Christmas or Hanukkah present for your country and donate all you can. $100 from 200,000 supporters would equal $20 Million. $50 from 200,000 supporters would equal $10 Million. Out of a nation of 315 Million and Millions of Ron Paul supporters, this is possible. Lets shatter the record and send a message to our fellow citizens that we will no longer let this monetary terrorism happen on our watch ! Debt has increased from less than a Trillion in 1980, after 204 years as a nation, to $15 Trillion today, in just 30 years ! &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mRRmPj0Ogt0" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/6bNiDx7qTjA" target="_blank"&gt;http://youtu.be/6bNiD...&lt;/a&gt; In South Florida, we will be having 2 local tea parties.
