Buntdown was voted &amp;quot;Best of Show&amp;quot; at the American Baseball Coaches Association Convention  in Philadelphia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buntline.com describes Tom’s product as “similar in size to a conventional bat but differing in shape in that the hitting surface is half-round from just above the trademark to the end of the bat. This encourages the batter to keep the bat over the path of the ball which is essential when bunting. When used properly, this bat teaches the batter to hit the ball on the ground and not to pop it into the air. Repeated use effectively reinforces the primary rule in bunting which is to let the ball come to the bottom of the bat.” Tom’s product represents the first significant change in a product that has been on the market since 1957.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom will describe the story behind the development of his product, applying for his design patent, and his sales strategy.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the SEC Education Room 1st Level</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Cormier</member_name><member_id>6323188</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238623710000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228351646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Innovators' Resource Network February Meetup</name><id>9276017</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233791100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/9276017/</event_url></item>
