We're having it at the Limelight in Boston again, but in a much larger studio this time.  Space is limited, so please RSVP right away so we can reserve a spot for you.  I have removed the &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; option as in the past, few people who RSVP'd &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; ever attended.  The admission fee is $10.00 which is half off their standard studio pricing.  I have given you the option of paying in advance through Paypal if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our members range from semi-professional to first-time karaoke singers.  We have excellent performers who provide high quality entertainment for us all, we have beginners who are surprisingly good but nonetheless want a supportive group to try out their talents.  Then there are the rest of us in various stages of development.  All experience levels are welcome and supported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I will be posting pictures from the June 30th Meetup soon.  So please come back and take a look at the fun everyone had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, I look forward to meeting you at this Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Meetup Coordinator,&lt;br /&gt;- Phil&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Philip L</member_name><member_id>1522860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185239385000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonkaraoke</urlname><id>212993</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183674269000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup - July 21st</name><id>5979932</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185058800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonkaraoke/events/5979932/</event_url></item>
