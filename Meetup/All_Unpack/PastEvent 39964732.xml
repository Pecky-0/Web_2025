Distance Time Elev Change Trail / Waypoint Latitude Longitude starting at Mount Morgan Trailhead 43&amp;deg; 47' 22" 71&amp;deg; 32' 57" This trail leaves the west side of NH 113, 5.5 mi. northeast of its junction with US 3 in Holderness and 6.3 mi. southwest of its junction with NH 109 in Center Sandwich. From the small parking area, the trail follows a logging road, turning left off it almost immediately. 0.10 mi 4 min +47 ft on Mount Morgan Trail 0.10 mi 4 min +47 ft This trail leaves the west side of NH 113, northeast of its junction with US 3 in Holderness and southwest of its junction with NH 109 in Center Sandwich. From the parking area, the trail follows a logging road, turning left off it almost immediately. It soon reaches the Morse Trail (Morgan-Percival Connector) diverging right, leading to the Mt. Percival Trail. to the junction of Morse Trail 43&amp;deg; 47' 23" 71&amp;deg; 33' 03" 0.50 mi 16 min -12 ft on Morse Trail 0.60 mi 20 min +34 ft This trail links the lower ends of the Mt. Morgan and Mt. Percival trails, making possible an excellent loop hike without a road walk on NH 113. The Morse Trail descends easily to cross a small brook. It passes through a stone wall and ascends gradually, crosses a brook on a footbridge at 0.4 mi., passes through another stone wall, and bears right to meet the Mt. Percival Trail, 0.2 mi. from NH 113. to the junction of Mount Percival Trail 43&amp;deg; 47' 35" 71&amp;deg; 32' 54" 1.80 mi 1 hr 37 min +1359 ft on Mount Percival Trail 2.40 mi 1 hr 57 min +1393 ft This trail provides access to the fine views and interesting boulder caves on Mt. Percival, and in combination with the Mt. Morgan Trail and Crawford-Ridgepole Trail, offers one of the most popular and scenic loop hikes on the southern fringe of the White Mountains. The Mt. Percival Trail passes through a clearing, and it turns left onto a relocated section, then loops back to rejoin the original route. After a slight descent, it crosses a brook and climbs moderately. Then it turns right (northeast) and traverses the south slope of Mt. Percival. The trail then swings left and climbs steeply to a fork (From this fork an alternate route diverges left and ascends a difficult and very strenuous route through a boulder cave (not recommended in wet weather), then continues up ledges to the summit.) Here the main trail turns right, struggles up a steep, rough ledgy section, crosses a cliff top with a fine view of Squam Lake, and continues over ledges to join the Crawford- Ridgepole Trail at the summit. to Mt Percival 43&amp;deg; 48' 34" 71&amp;deg; 33' 25" 0.80 mi 29 min -34 ft on Crawford-Ridgepole Trail 3.20 mi 2 hr 26 min +1360 ft This trail follows the backbone of the Squam Range from Sandwich Notch Rd. to the south knob of Cotton Mountain. Except for the very popular segment between Mt. Percival and Mt. Morgan, the trail is used infrequently, despite fine views in the Squam-Doublehead section. Continuing along the ridge with minor ups and downs and occasional views, it passes just west of the actual high point of the range (sometimes called the Sawtooth, it can be reached by a short but thick bushwhack and has a restricted view), and continues to a junction with the Mt. Morgan Trail. Here the Mt. Morgan Trail leads to the right 90 yd. to a fork; the left branch (almost straight ahead) leads another 50 yd. to a fine cliff-top viewpoint, whereas the right branch climbs 50 yd. to the true summit of Mt. Morgan, where there is a restricted view north. to the junction of Mount Morgan Trail 43&amp;deg; 48' 14" 71&amp;deg; 33' 54" 0.10 mi 4 min +38 ft on Mount Morgan Trail 3.30 mi 2 hr 30 min +1398 ft Here the Mt. Morgan Trail leads right to the cliff-top viewpoint; partway along, a short spur leaves it on the right and runs to the true summit. to Mt Morgan 43&amp;deg; 48' 14" 71&amp;deg; 33' 58" 0.10 mi 4 min -38 ft on Mount Morgan Trail 3.40 mi 2 hr 34 min +1360 ft The Mt. Morgan Trail leads from the summit to the junction with the Crawford-Ridgepole Trail. The two trails coincide, descending a set of steps. 2 Distance Time Elev Change Trail / Waypoint Latitude Longitude to the junction of Crawford-Ridgepole Trail 43&amp;deg; 48' 14" 71&amp;deg; 33' 54" 0.30 mi 18 min -308 ft on Mount Morgan Trail 3.70 mi 2 hr 52 min +1052 ft The two trails continue, descending to a junction where the Mt. Morgan Trail diverges left and descends off the ridge. to the junction of Crawford-Ridgepole Trail 43&amp;deg; 48' 01" 71&amp;deg; 33' 57" 1.60 mi 1 hr 19 min -1005 ft on Mount Morgan Trail 5.30 mi 4 hr 11 min +47 ft The Mt. Morgan Trail descends the southeast slope of the mountain then traverses to the south and descends east at a moderate grade. The Morse Trail (Morgan-Percival Connector) diverges left, leading to the Mt. Percival Trail. to the junction of Morse Trail 43&amp;deg; 47' 23" 71&amp;deg; 33' 03" 5.30 mi 4 hr 11 min +47 ft Totals&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>WE'LL BE IN A FOUR DOOR SILVER SUBARU LEGACY</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321213320000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320430355000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PERCIVAL MORGAN LOOP</name><id>39964732</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321108200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/39964732/</event_url></item>
