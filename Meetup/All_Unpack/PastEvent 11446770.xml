That means 50% off climbing and gear rental if you dress up like a pirate!  Now as a sponsor of this meetup gorup, Rock Spot Climbing gives us an amazing deal of $10 if you have gear, and $15 if you need gear and or a lesson, so this is a super amazing night!  If you have your own gear it's just $5 as long as you come dressed like a pirate.  Arrrrr!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there at 7 until about 10-ish, mostly top roping due to a funky back, but the boulder just got reset so I suggest you come down and check that out as well.  The gym is open until midnight so don't feel you have to leave at 10 when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've never been to Rock Spot Climbing you will need to take a belay lesson or test if you plan on top rope climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, there will also be free snacks as part of pirate night.  No promises on what kind of snacks, but definitely chocolate coins and something else theme-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there Friday Night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Kat&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kat Waterhouse</member_name><member_id>8778978</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256232007000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Rock-Climbers</urlname><id>1496386</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>South Shore Rock Climbers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253721276000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pirate Night at Rock Spot Climbing- Yaaarrrrrr</name><id>11446770</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253919600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Rock-Climbers/events/11446770/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/2/9/global_9903881.jpeg</photo_url></item>
