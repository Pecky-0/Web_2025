Let's give thanks to Nature. Nothing like a little fresh air and exercise, to close out a holiday weekend! Sleeping Giant is a nice central location, and it has enough trails that we can try something entirely new this time.  There will probably be some rocks to climb over, so please keep that in mind. &lt;b&gt;We will not be walking the tower trail.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will be at Sleeping Giant, which is a Connecticut State Park located in Hamden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN: Sleeping Giant is a great park for any level of hiking. &lt;b&gt;For this Meetup, we will try one of the more difficult trails, with more incline and more rocks to climb over.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the entrance, which is located on Mt. Carmel Avenue, between 9:45 and 10, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by 10:05. This particular hike will take 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: Water! (And a snack if you like.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads; warm LAYERS; a hat and gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please see link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: Please take advantage of the street parking on Mt. Carmel Avenue, adjacent to the park, ACROSS FROM (not inside) Quinnipiac University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325264" target="_blank"&gt;Sleeping Giant State Park Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Sarah (Group Organizer) will be wearing red.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228570337000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227113778000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Early-bird Hiking Thanksgiving Weekend Meetup</name><id>9193310</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228057200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/9193310/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/4/global_6216756.jpeg</photo_url></item>
