The weather is predicted to be dry (and the preceding day should be sunny with a high of 51), so it is hopeful that the rain on Thursday will mostly dry out on the hill by Sat.  I suggest hiking footwear that is water proof (there is still mud), not wearing cotton, and a bottle of water. Dress warm with hat, and gloves optional.  &lt;br /&gt;We will do the Sam Adams brewery tour at 2pm following the hike in the afternoon. If you don't plan on hiking and only want to do the tour (or just the hike), respond to the two questions in the RSVP to make your selections. &lt;br /&gt;Directions: Houghton's Pond is exit 3 off rte 93 in Milton. once off the exit, you,ll be on Ponkapoag Trail which turns into Blue Hills River Road. At the end of Blue Hills River Road, take a right onto Hillside Street. Go another .25 mile and you'll see a large parking lot on the right.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad</member_name><member_id>3842442</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260306712000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259846673000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Blue Hills on Saturday and/or Sam Adams brewery tour</name><id>12008160</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260025200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/12008160/</event_url></item>
