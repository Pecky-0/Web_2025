&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;12 Noon - Pre-Game:&amp;nbsp; Show up with a box of your favorite cereal and register.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;ll be donating the cereal to a local food pantry.&amp;nbsp; You may bring a $10 donation in lieu of a box of cereal if you prefer.&amp;nbsp; However, part of the fun is sharing why the cereal you brought is your favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;12:30-1:30pm - 9 Innings of Dates:&amp;nbsp; This portion of the event will be like speed dating only we&amp;rsquo;re calling it &amp;lsquo;Cereal Dating!&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp; You will have blocks of time to sit down and chat with other attendees.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you will make a meetup match!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;1:35pm Extra Innings-Grab your favorite date, watch the Sox game and then maybe the Pats game too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members are encouraged to bring a friend of the opposite sex. This will help us keep the male/female ratio balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you will attend and arrive on time. You must have a real photo posted in order to attend. Members who RSVP without a photo will be deleted from the Natives Meetup.
 &lt;br /&gt;Scoreboard Sports Bar and Grill is a great place to socialize, have some food/drink and watch a game. Some other groups will be joining us&amp;hellip;make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on the fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Note:&amp;nbsp; Please bring your favorite box of cereal to be donated to a local food pantry as an entry fee or a $10.00&amp;nbsp; donation.
