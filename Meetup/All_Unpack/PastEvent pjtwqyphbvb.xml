&lt;p&gt;I love, loved tUnE-yArDs' first album, and the second, released this week, is being praised as one of the best of the year.&amp;nbsp; I would try to describe her music, but I'd do it badly.&amp;nbsp; It's different and amazing...give it a listen.&amp;nbsp; And the best part?&amp;nbsp; As good as the albums are, by all accounts they don't do justice to how good the music is performed live.&amp;nbsp; I know it's a Monday, but I promise it'll be worth your while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet around 8:30 at the venue to grab a beer and socialize before the show.&amp;nbsp; Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tUnE-yArDs is the lo-fi experimental folk project of Merrill Garbus, also of the noisy indie pop band Sister Suvi. A truly solo project, Garbus began writing and performing under the tUnE-yArDs moniker in 2006. She assembled songs with a digital voice recorder and shareware mixing software, making a homespun patchwork of found sounds, field recordings, ukulele, unusual percussion, and her surprisingly soulful vocals. It took Garbus two years to piece her debut album, Bird-Brains, together, then she offered it as a pay-what-you-want download on the tUnE-yArDs website. Thanks to frequent touring with artists like Thao and positive buzz from music blogs, Garbus sold over $1,000 worth of copies of the album. In spring 2009, Marriage Records released the album on vinyl; that summer 4AD reissued it in a special screen-printed version limited to 1,000 copies before releasing a widely distributed CD version of Bird-Brains that fall, coinciding with a tour opening for the Dirty Projectors. For 2011's W H O K I L L, Garbus added bassist Nate Brenner to the fold and ventured into a professional studio for a more polished but still wide-ranging sound.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/text me on 617-549-8453 when you arrive to find the group.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew</member_name><member_id>8828135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305643841000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303307536000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>tUnE-yArDs @ Brighton Music Hall</name><id>pjtwqyphbvb</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305592200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/17371381/</event_url></item>
