Join us on this first day of spring as the snow-covered ground gives way to the earliest spring flowers and the swelling of magnolia and red maple buds.  We will observe the early signs of spring’s arrival and learn how to identify some of the most interesting trees and shrubs at Mount Auburn by their buds, twig and bark characteristics. Hot refreshments and an indoor quiz will bring the walk to a warm conclusion.  It sounds like it will be a fun way to spend an afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten the group a discount so that we only have to pay the member price of $5.  Unfortunately, they are sticking with the 20 person limit so please change your RSVP if you can't make it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should register in advance with Mount Auburn by emailing friends@mountauburn.org. You can either pay when you get there or you can pay online if you like by clicking: Link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - John&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>10829130</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1269281152000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268348209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mount Auburn Winter Tree and Shrub Identification</name><id>12852910</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269108000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12852910/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
