&lt;p&gt;Time Elev Change Trail / Waypoint Latitude Longitude starting at Mount Kearsarge North Trailhead 44° 04' 31" 71° 06' 33" This trail ascends Kearsarge North from a small parking area on the north side of Hurricane Mountain Rd., 1.5 mi. east of NH 16 near the state highway rest area at Intervale. 3.10 mi 2 hr 52 min +2587 ft on Mount Kearsarge North Trail 3.10 mi 2 hr 52 min +2587 ft This trail is a very popular and relatively easy trail to the magnificent views of Kearsarge North, but inexperienced hikers should not underestimate the total climb of 2,600 ft., which is comparable to the ascent required for many much higher peaks. Leaving the road, the trail runs level for a short distance, then climbs rather easily past a summer residence on an old road well up on the bank above a brook. It passes several boulders, and the old road starts to become rougher. It climbs steadily into a ledgy area, where there are views to Mt. Chocorua and Moat Mountain, crosses the crest of the ridge connecting Kearsarge North to Bartlett Mountain, then swings right and ascends mostly along the north side of the ridge. The trail makes a sharp right turn at a steep spot, then angles upward, circling to the left around to the west edge of the summit ledges, and climbs to the tower. to Kearsarge North 44° 06' 21" 71° 05' 39" 3.10 mi 2 hr 52 min -2587 ft on Mount Kearsarge North Trail 6.20 mi 5 hr 44 min 0 ft The Mount Kearsarge North Trail descends from the summit fire tower.
