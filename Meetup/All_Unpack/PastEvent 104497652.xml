In this exhibition, curated John Quatrale, the artist captures the horizons of our lives. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This exhibition of encaustic paintings presents familiar linear horizons or skylines separated by skies, water and land.  The encaustic paint is basically the use of colored pigments added to heated beeswax.  Many of her newer paintings an elevated level of wax texture that add a greater sense of realism to the panorama. Sometimes, as in Desert Wildfire, she adds muted flowing clouds and a mix of rippling sea colors to create a greater sense of mystery and the present moment for these “vanishing perspectives”. Ruth then “mimics the brightness found in nature, such as a warm sunset or the minimal stillness of a northern oceanscape, with its cool blues”.  The result is a simple but mesmerizing picture of one of nature’s most profound and contemplative vistas. To Ruth,  true horizons “represent fragments of time that will never be again; intimate moments shared with something greater than myself; quiet meditations to which I bear witness. They compel me to paint.”  As such, she prods the viewers to look beyond trying to identify the specific horizon in favor of  experiencing and feeling the stillness as well as the unifying power of those fleeting skylines. &lt;br /&gt;
