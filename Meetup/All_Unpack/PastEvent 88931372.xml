<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's hope that Sandy is all gone and that we get a gorgeous day! We are going to the hike the cranberry bogs and upland trails around Halfway Pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike will be between 3 and 4 miles, some hills, beautiful photo opportunities. We will be out approximately two hours. Most of the hike will be on Wildlands Trust property, no hunting allowed. However, it is hunting season so people and dogs may want to wear orange.  There is parking available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you went to the Governor's celebration in August for the 100,000 acres of Conservation Land, this is right across the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get there is going down Long Pond Road heading south of Myles Standish, go 3.6 miles from the State Forest entrance, and then turn right (west) on Halfway Pond Road. Go 0.8 miles on Halfway Pond Road and then turn right on West Long Pond Road. The Meetup spot is only 0.3 miles down West Long Pond Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
