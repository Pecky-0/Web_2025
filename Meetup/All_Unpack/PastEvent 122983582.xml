 &lt;strong&gt;Distance: 8 Miles&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hike of the Beach Pond area located south of Rt 165.  The hike follows a map and directions in “Walks in the Watershed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance is about 8 miles, and will take nearly four hours.The  hike has been rated &lt;em&gt;"Difficult"&lt;/em&gt; for the combination of length, terrain, and planned pace. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;This is not a hike for first-timers in this group, nor for beginners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Please keep this in mind when considering signing up for the hike.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This hike starts at Beach Pond on the &lt;em&gt;Tippecansett Trail,&lt;/em&gt; and then brings us by Hemlock Ledges, and we will climb to the top of a scenic “Lookout” spot. After that we will follow the &lt;em&gt;White Dot Trail, Dye Hill Trail, Brushy Brook Trail,&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Deep Pond Trails&lt;/em&gt; before we complete the hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Walks in the Watershed” calls this “a remote area of deep woods, streams, ponds, and hemlock-covered ledges” We will go by the ruins of a farm, cross a broken dam, and cross “hogback ridges”  We will check out Deep Pond, on the hike too. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 With the rocky trails and stream crossings, a pair of hiking boots is strongly suggested. With the warm weather, come prepared with bug spray for protection from ticks and other insects. Bring sufficient water and snacks along for a 4 hour hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a chance for rain in the forecast. Be prepared with the right clothing in the event it rains during the hike. Rt 165 is currently under construction, so there may be unpaved sections of road and possible delays. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 From Providence: Take I-95 south to exit 5A, (Rt. 102 south). At the merge of Rt. 102 and Rt. 3, take Rt. 3 south. Continue on Rt. 3 south for another mile to the next light (a flashing light) at the intersection of Rt. 3 and Rt. 165. Turn right at the flashing light onto Rt. 165 west. Follow Rt. 165 west for about 7 miles, until you come to Beach Pond. Park in the lot on the right side of the highway, and on the RI side of the pond. Using this lot will let us meet in one parking lot. The lot on the opposite side of Rt 165 is where we will start the hike, but parking is more limited there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
