I'm sorry to change the day from Saturday to Sunday at this late date.   As long as the anti-fur demonstrations are on Saturday I don't want to conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Thanks to everyone who helped last week. Please consider helping out if you &lt;br /&gt;haven't yet. It really is a pretty easy thing to do to bring the cruelty of &lt;br /&gt;fur to the public's attention. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;Linda &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dino's International Furs &lt;br /&gt;135 Lafayette Road (Rt 1) &lt;br /&gt;North Hampton, NH &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sat Feb 2 Noon - 2:00pm &lt;br /&gt;Sat Feb 16 Noon - 2:00pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signs will be provided, but feel free to bring your own.

Their skins &lt;br /&gt;are ripped off, sometimes while they are still alive, and made into fur &lt;br /&gt;coats and collars.
