Do you want to live in strong communities where your rights are respected, and people exercise responsibility for themselves and in their dealings with each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to those questions, then the Free State Project has a solution for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FSP has a huge summer event each year called the Porcupine Freedom Festival at a family campground in Northern New-Hampshire. There will probably be 7-800 people there this year with speakers, music, dances, food, fun, campfires, parties - it's quite an event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year’s Porcupine Freedom Festival is gearing up to become the biggest and most successful so far! Approximately 500 advance tickets were sold! If you have not secured your lodging and admission, now is the time! (Lodging may still be available at the AltExpo (site #2) - write Dan@AltExpo.org for camping space)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the people you’ll meet at Porcfest 2010:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Stefan Molyneux of Free Domain Radio&lt;br /&gt;    * Michael Badnarik of constitutionpreservation.org&lt;br /&gt;    * Marc Stevens of Adventures in Legal Land&lt;br /&gt;    * Gov.

There's a lot of interest in the formation of a WAC chapter there and we  already have 3 active 9/11  Truth groups: Seacoast (Portsmouth), &lt;a href="http://MV911T.org" target="_blank"&gt;Merrimack Valley&lt;/a&gt; (Nashua, Manchester and Concord) and Monadnock (Keene).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277392787000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276317401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Porcupine Freedom Festival in New-Hampshire</name><id>13776909</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277388000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/13776909/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/4/3/global_15647699.jpeg</photo_url></item>
