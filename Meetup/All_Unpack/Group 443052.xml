The group's primary aim is to offer support for the writing process in a informal and friendly atmosphere. We offer feedback, but we are not about ripping somebody's work to shreds and bruising their confidence, that's the job of literary agents and publishers once your work is finished, and besides we want people to come back for more meetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership fees are $12 a year. Members can either pay for the whole year in advance or every six months. Your organizer will let you know when fees are due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please click on the $12.00 a year link under membership dues for further details.&lt;/p&gt;
