We will still be playing at our usual time and place. This is a great opportunity to stretch the legs and have some fun playing football. Our goal is to have fun and to meet new people as well as play some football. Saturday at 4pm just across the road from the Alewife - Red line 'T' Stop head toward Rindge Ave. We will be on or near the football field. Everyone is welcome to join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, b/c we don't charge for this meetup, we are attempting to generate some interest in a men's flag-football league to help us cover costs. We will be starting July 19th and registration has already begun. The first two teams to signup will not have to pay referee fees. Free Agency, rules, registration, etc. can all be found at our site... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://baffl.blogspot.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://baffl.blogspot...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let us know if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215461638000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214972453000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FLAG FOOTBALL - SAT 4PM - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8260731</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215288000000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8260731/</event_url></item>
