<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;WOW, we have some lineup for April's meeting.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Bob Adelizzi, from Boston ATC will be talking with us.  There's been a few operational changes that are being enforced all over. He will do a Class B, pilot/ATC Communications refresher and talk about the changes. He's also looking for some real life radio transmissions to use for us.  Bob is another dynamic speaker and can answer any questions we have about ATC's operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Jim Adams of the FAA FAAST TEAM will also be there. He has endorsed this as another WINGS program. FAA will also be advertising this as well as our AirVenture raffle.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expect this to be fully packed again and will need to probably be set up in the Bullock Hangar instead of our usual meeting room.  This has come together with the additional help of Jim Bisson and the FAA. What a great group we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also be discussing the possible Wings and Wheels from our last meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AirVentue raffle tickets are still on sale for The Big Weekend... Drawing will be at April's meeting.... Here's your chance to attend the Greatest Aviation event in the world..  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, food at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also working on having worldwide reknown aerobatic performer Mike Goulian speak at one of our meetings before the summer. Possibly May or Junes meeting... Where else can you have this much excitement for $25 bucks a year? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon. &lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ Hume</member_name><member_id>4096811</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Bisson</member_name><member_id>6711202</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Reinhart</member_name><member_id>6711977</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241039515000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237331457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association EAA Chapter 1454 April Meetup</name><id>9976129</id><headcount>130</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239746400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/9976129/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/c/1/global_4198801.jpeg</photo_url></item>
