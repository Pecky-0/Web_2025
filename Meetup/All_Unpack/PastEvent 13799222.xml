Learn more about this event at the MGN Website: mgn.cardsconversation.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back by popular demand!!! Don't miss out on the event everyone is talking about. Join us for our next Meetup Game Nite. This is a great way to mix and mingle with old and new friends, and perhaps learn something about other meetup groups in the area! So grab your favorite board games, a deck of cards, and anyone that you want to bring for an early night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the following Meetup groups are participating for MGN6:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Beantown Gamers&lt;br /&gt;    * Boston Cards and Conversation&lt;br /&gt;    * Girls Just Want To Have FUN&lt;br /&gt;    * Inquisitive Minds&lt;br /&gt;    * Mass Fun and Games&lt;br /&gt;    * Social Fun&lt;br /&gt;    * Peanut Butter &amp;amp; Jelly&lt;br /&gt;    * The Boston Volunteer Meetup&lt;br /&gt;    * Discover The Boston Networking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, MeetIn Boston and the Yelp community will also be participating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any card and board games are welcome. What to bring? Well, Apples to Apples and Catch Phrase are always a hit at MGN. Up for some strategy games? You'll see Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, and other board games being played. Those of you who love cards, but don't quite remember how to play, don't despair! Members of Boston Cards and Conversation are always willing to teach old and new card games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mafia has been a hit at the past events and will surely be played again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't stay at home and watch TV, come out and have some FUN with us. And if you're going out on Friday night, the event is early enough that you can come socialize, play a few games, and then hit the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come for dinner, ice cream, or just games and socializing! Since this is an open event, come early, come late, stay for a bit, stay for the whole event, anything goes! Games last until 9:30pm or so, and many people go out for drinks and food after the event...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the rear of Food Court next to Pizzeria Regina. Look for the Meetup sign. Are you game???&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for the game players on the right side in the food court near Pizzeria Regina</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>8840173</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277044445000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>95</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276546778000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night 6 at the Pru</name><id>13799222</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276900200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/13799222/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
