This is a repeat from last year, but well worth it. (Especially if you're a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes on PBS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Please note that the lead actors, Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, alternated the roles of Frankenstein and the Creature during the original run. At this screening Jonny Lee Miller will play the role of the Creature. I already saw the version with Cumberbatch as the Creature, and it's fantastic. If you're interested in that version, the Coolidge will show it on Sunday June 17th at 10am.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Frankenstein:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally-acclaimed filmmaker Danny Boyle (&lt;em&gt;Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours&lt;/em&gt;) directs this production of &lt;span&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/span&gt;, a new play by Nick Dear, based on the novel by Mary Shelley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childlike in his innocence but grotesque in form, Frankenstein’s bewildered creature is cast out into a hostile universe by his horror-struck maker. Meeting with cruelty wherever he goes, the friendless Creature, increasingly desperate and vengeful, determines to track down his creator and strike a terrifying deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent concerns of scientific responsibility, parental neglect, cognitive development and the nature of good and evil are embedded within this thrilling and deeply disturbing classic gothic tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Shelley’s &lt;span&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/span&gt; is adapted for the stage by Nick Dear and realised by Danny Boyle in his return to the theatre after winning the Academy Award for best director for &lt;span&gt;Slumdog Millionaire&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jonny Lee Miller&lt;/strong&gt; will alternate the roles of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. (The two actors shared the Award for Best Actor at the Olivier Awards, which is England's equivalent of the Tonys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doors open and pre-show begins approx. 30m prior to start time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at Panera very briefly before heading to the Coolidge. NT Live screenings are alway very popular, so we want to get there early enough to get good seats. Also, it's recommended you get your ticket well in advance, since they often sell out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa&lt;/p&gt;
