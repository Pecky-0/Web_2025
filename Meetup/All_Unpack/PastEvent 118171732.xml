Basically, people donate $10 each (if they want) and if they win, they get $5 for each team that donated, and the rest goes to the charity. Anyone can still play the quiz without paying, but you won't win the extra cash that way. :D Join us Monday, May 13th, for Geeks Who Drink pub quiz at Battery Park! Last week, Team "Lucic Fight Club" took home second prize.Â  WHOO HOOO!! The quiz starts at 7:00pm - join us and Geeks Who Drink &lt;a href="http://geekswhodrink.com/518/"&gt;http://geekswhodrink.com/518/&lt;/a&gt; . The quiz consists of 8 rounds of 8 questions and includes a picture round, music round, and chances for FREE BEER!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is conveniently located in the Financial District near State Street (Orange and Blue Line), Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red Lines), and a short walk to Park Street (Red and Green Lines). Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE PAY AS YOU GO OR MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB.
