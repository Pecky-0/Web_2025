&lt;p&gt;Don't miss this opportunity to work directly with New England's most amazing Didge player!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is designed to allow participants to effectively clear out energetic and emotional stagnation from each of the seven major energy centers (Chakras) of the body. Through his collection of concert class eucalyptus didgeridoos specifically tuned to the key of each Chakra, Joseph provides an atmosphere that not only reconnects the mind with the body but also allows participants to journey and meditate within each Chakra. The format includes a 3-minute opening meditation in the Crown Chakra followed by 6-8 minute meditations in the key of each subsequent Chakra. Through the process, participants will be guided to focus their awareness on the corresponding energy centers to promote clearing and connection with that center and with the energetic body. Participants are encouraged to bring meditation oils of their preference to the event. Presented by Joseph Carringer Joseph Carringer is a professional didgeridoo musician and sound therapist. He combines the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine with Ayurvedic Chakra philosophies to create a unique and powerful sound healing experience. Joseph has been playing an Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo for over a decade, using it as a deep meditative tool in his personal shamanic journey as well as a therapeutic intrument for his clients.
