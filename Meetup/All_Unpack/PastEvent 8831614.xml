Members are Edelton Gloeden, Everton Gloeden, Tadeu do Amaral, and eight-sting guitar master Paul Galbraith.   All of the members were enjoying successful music careers even before this guitar ensemble began.  Together, the foursome quickly earned a nickname, the Dream Team, from Brazilian reviewers. The Brazilian Guitar Quartet recorded its debut album in 1999, Essencia do Brasil, under the Delos Records label.  A sophomore offering, Cantamento, was completed two years later.  Positive reviews from music critics in publications like Classical Guitar Magazine helped increase the quartet's popularity in not only its homeland of Brazil, but also in Japan, England, and the United States. The group has done a number of extensive tours, appearing in many countries at festivals and concert halls. Some of the instrumental tracks fans can sample from recordings made by the Brazilian Guitar Quartet are &amp;quot;Allegro Scherzoso,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Danca Negra,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Cancao Sertaneja,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Allegro Animato,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Largo-Andante Expressivo,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lundu.&amp;quot; ~ Charlotte Dillon, All Music Guide &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets: $30 general admission / $25 members to the Boston Classical Guitar Society/ $20 seniors and students&lt;br /&gt;/ $15 senior and student members.
