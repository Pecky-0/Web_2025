<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Bar is a great place providing 3 atmopshere. Once you enter, to the right is a brick oven pizza restaurant. There Pizza is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the left, is an area i call a "social bar" hardly any place to sit down. You're just up and chatting. If you're lucky you can get a game of pool in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last in the back they got a club area. DJ is ok there. He plays a little bit of everything. Specials at the bar are good. I can't complain... It'll be a good time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say to start things off, we should get some grub at the pizza restaurant along with drinks. That should start a good vibe until the dance floor opens up or gets a little packed. And then we have a good night till 2am! (sarcastic about the 2am part. Why not til 4am?!?) Anyways, this should be a great time for all of us and for the newbies to feel welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anticipation for the BAR in New Haven event is over, it is now Scheduled. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
