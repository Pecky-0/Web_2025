Fellow group memeber Mitch has agreed to host this event. Contact him at 617-470-2807 AFTER the show for post meetup coffee and chit chat about the movie. Thanks! &lt;br /&gt;Jenn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the late notice, but I just discovered this: As part of the Independent Film Festival of Boston, there will be a one-time showing of the documentary &amp;quot;Searching for Elliott Smith,&amp;quot; on Monday, 4/26, at Somerville Theatre, at 7:30.  I did not even know this film existed (!), but considering that he may well be the greatest songwriter *ever*, let alone in the history of indie rock, I am definitely planning to attend and thought perhaps there'd be interest by other members of this group.  Anyone want to join?  (No, it's not a concert, and it will surely be more depressing than one :-), but this is a great opportunity to go behind the scenes of the life and death of a genius and legend. I know I've always been intensely curious.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further info and ticket purchasing here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://iffboston.bside.com/2010/films/searchingforelliottsmith_iffboston2010;jsessionid=399A2747E59F75BC5B644FC2620CE1B5" target="_blank"&gt;http://iffboston.bsid...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call 617-470-2807 after the movie to meetup. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenn</member_name><member_id>10142965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272498193000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272304125000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Searching for Elliott Smith" documentary -- one-time-only showing!</name><id>13295634</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272324600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/13295634/</event_url></item>
