<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I recently did this loop in an effort to get back in shape and found it just enough of a workout.  Please note, this is a HIKE not a walk.  You should be in decent shape, with properly broken in foot (or boot) wear.  Hiking poles are recommended for balance.  This is a moderate hike with rolling foothills and level areas in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailhead begins at the Trailside Museum (RT 138 N) (see link).  We'll take the red-dotted trail to intersection 1055 to Eliot Tower.  From there we'll pick up Southern Skyline (1066) to reservation headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the return trip we'll take Northern Skyline back to Eliot Tower, over Coon Hollow Path and back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike may take a bit longer than our usual duration.  I'm guessing 2.5 to 3 hours.  Please bring plenty of water and a lunch.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trailside Museum parking lot is a popular one, so carpooling is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info and trail map: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/blue.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Norm</member_name><member_id>3307175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255357087000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252351342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Hills Loop (West Side) Hike</name><id>11311156</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255183200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/11311156/</event_url></item>
