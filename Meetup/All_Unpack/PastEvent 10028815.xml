Should have a good grasp of skills (passing, setting, hitting). For indoor games, 5-1 / 6-2 formation experience highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entrance to the gym is on Cambridge Street opposite the Skendarian Apothecary. The nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street and Roberts Road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you plan on attending. RSVP's will close on Sunday 3/29 at 10 AM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the meetup will be between $3 and $5, depending on the number of attendees. Please pay the organizer when you arrive before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of the court rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk from the T stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as meters and residential parking rules are generally not enforced on Sundays (parking signs should say &amp;quot;EX SUNDAY&amp;quot; or similar).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the Chinese guy wearing a pair of black framed sport goggles.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1238958877000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237942886000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CRLS Intermediate+ Indoor Volleyball Sun 3/29 2PM</name><id>10028815</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238349600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/10028815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
