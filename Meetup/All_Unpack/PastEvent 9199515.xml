We will be playing football this weekend at noon at Russell Field. Join in the fun. It doesn't matter what skill level you are, just bring a good attitude. We play on a turf field, so don't worry if you don't have spikes. Come join in if you haven't been yet, its a great way to meet people in a relaxed environment. Also a good way to get some fresh air and stretch your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The field is just across the Alewife Brook Pkwy from the Alewife stop on the Red Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is suppose to be very cold this coming saturday so dress accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it this weekend,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BK&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>BK</member_name><member_id>4273085</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227892130000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227185346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT - 12PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>9199515</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227373200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/9199515/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
