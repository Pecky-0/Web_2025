That means more biking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us as we travel through Rhode Island's most beautiful bike path on Sunday at 10:45 AM.  Ride by water, greenery and scenic mills - all while in the company of one of the state's most famous bicyclists (me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blackstone River Bikeway is 10 miles of paved bike path from Lincoln through Valley Falls Heritage Park in Cumberland and ends in Woonsocket at the Water Treatment Plant on Manville Hill Road.  We'll be riding at a leisurly pace.  I got a bit too excited on our last ride, so please be sure to give us a shout if you think we're going too quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at The Blackstone River State Park, Front Street, Lincoln. To find us: pull into the address listed above, go down the road for maybe a mile and we'll be at the first parking lot on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Fellow organizer Christine is going to be holding a &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Bicycling/calendar/15141837/"&gt;walk at Lincoln Woods&lt;/a&gt; later that afternoon (it's just 1 mile away!), so you could easily do both activities!  I'll be attending both.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a guy on a red bike with a red car or try my cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288008361000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287520752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BIKING the Blackstone on Sunday!</name><id>15162546</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287931500000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/15162546/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/0/e/global_18897086.jpeg</photo_url></item>
