<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;JOIN US FOR A PUGGIE SPRING CELEBRATION AT THE APRIL PUG MEETUP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my goodness, your organizer is actually hosting the April spring meetup, and I'd love to see you all there!&amp;nbsp; This time, the meetup is going to be in Brockton in my back yard, and there is plenty of room for parking, both in my driveway and on my street, which is a quiet residential street.&amp;nbsp; Cletus and Clovis can't wait to host all their little friends.&amp;nbsp; I guess I'd better get started with my spring cleaning, inside and out!&amp;nbsp; Okay, okay, so I favor the rough and tumble look.&amp;nbsp; Pug fuzz accessorizes with EVERYTHING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be providing the soft drinks and paperware, and of course we are counting on our ever resourceful members to bring the snacks. Feel free to bring snacks for the Pugs.  Our members have never failed us yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let your organizer know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very fortunate to have Annie to host our indoor meetups over the winter, and Sharon to host most of our fair weather meetups over the rest of the year, with occasional help from myself, but we are always delighted to change the venue when someone else wants to host a meetup!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping that the folks who have hosted before will be able will step in and host a social or two in 2011. For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 20 to 50 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host! It's fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats when you can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control. We want everyone to have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis's and Cletus's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303221521000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>we want to!</why><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1300147629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston April Pug Sunday Meetup</name><id>16922162</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303063200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/16922162/</event_url></item>
