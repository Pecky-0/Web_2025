I was told we might be in a different room this time so that's a solid 20...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to get there a little early (you can always have a drink in the bar) as parking can be tough at O'Connor's.  Again, and for newbies, restaurants will not split the check for large parties up so please bring cash!  Changes will be posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please only RSVP YES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; if you are &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;POSITIVE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you can attend.  I can't set this up for maybes because it is a fixed number group.  We understand dropouts are unavoidable sometimes, but your YES could keep someone who could go from knowing that it's a possibility.  If you are dropping out, get in touch with me asap so I can get the message out that we have room for one more.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chris&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris Lackey</member_name><member_id>7618967</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266797568000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264278114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Atheist Meetup Dinner &amp; Drinks 5</name><id>12402311</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266624000000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/12402311/</event_url></item>
