With Halloween just around the corner, this month's book is &amp;quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&amp;quot; by Ray Bradbury. Thank you Ashley for the suggestion! We wanted something spooky and it looks like we have a winner. Thank you everyone who voted in our poll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting again at Pandemonium in Central Square. There is free parking (after 6pm) in Central on Prospect Street. There is also a lot around the corner from Pandemonium on Green Street ($8 for the night). There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;-Josh&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>9704391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288738639000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284342633000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Book Club</name><id>14747803</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287012600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/14747803/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
