Please arrive at 8pm (not earlier please). Light snacks, BYOB (alcohol ok if you are 21+). This event is hosted by Niki and Joe at their abode in south part of Amherst. It is pretty easy to get to by car and there is also a PVTA bus stop right in front of their apartment. Note it is apartment i (as in igloo), not the number 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jonathon Podolsky</member_name><member_id>9289550</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345345856000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>filmgroup</urlname><id>1279822</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Western MA Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344913459000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Timey Wimey of Doctor Who and the episode "Blink"</name><id>77649572</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345334400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/filmgroup/events/77649572/</event_url></item>
