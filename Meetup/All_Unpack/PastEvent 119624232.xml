So please, join Steve Ob1. and friends at anytime for some easy exercise and fun, or just to come and sit and watch. Wimp Volleyball is a noncompetitive games. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We following the rules. But, having fun, getting some exercise, and learning, will be more important than winning. In these games, we work on trying to keep the volley going. Rather than trying to end the volley. We do not count the score. We count the laughs. The winners in these games, are those who sides hurt the most from laughing to much. We usually have a larger number attending. So, we will rotate everyone through. If we have enough of those people who must play to win, and follow exactly to the rules. We will try to have another net set up for them. So, bring your friends, and your teens, an your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and Bug repellent. Plus, a chair if you want? &lt;br /&gt;

 Also we often go out afterwords ( 8 pm. ) for some food or drink. So, plan to join us for that also. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be asking for a $1.00 donation to help play for the equipment. But please remember, your attends is more important than the your money. We would rather you play than pay. The money is only to help pay for the maintenance and the equipment. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will also have another event going at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wimp Volleyball Chatting &amp;amp; Cheerleading." This event requires a lawn chair and the ability to chat. This event is for those who would like to play. But, know they just don't have the energy. So, they just sit, watch, and chat. &lt;br /&gt;
