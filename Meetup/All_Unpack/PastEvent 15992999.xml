Something good, fun and inexpensive? How about a great Greek meal at Cavos in Newington! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great comfort food...mouthwatering Greek delacacies...available here for your enjoyment. Read what one reviewer had to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;These guys are doing it right! It is SO exciting to visit a Greek restaurant with such a great menu selection of actual Greek dishes reaching beyond gyros and grapes leaves (no hate on those either, but just saying...). And a family-run, small business with owners you can meet and have a drink with and feel good about supporting... And the value for the price... And the service... all around, awesome. Internet-high-five!&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound interesting? Let's give it a try! Join us and have a great meal with friends, old and new. Terrific conversation...a few laughs...warm smiles. Ahhh...life is good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for  Terri or the Meetup Sign...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297457365000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><why>We all need a little comfort food once in awhile!</why><group><who>Fun Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mixing-it-Up</urlname><id>768057</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>MIXING IT UP IN WEST HARTFORD AND BEYOND</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294675186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Going Greek @ Cavos Tavern &amp; Pizzeria in Newington!</name><id>15992999</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297382400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mixing-it-Up/events/15992999/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/4/global_20727348.jpeg</photo_url></item>
