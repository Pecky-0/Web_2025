(art, history, and architecture).  I have gone many times and it's always fun.  The theme for this evening, April 9, is Emergence.  We'll meet at the visitor's center to get schedules for the night, then check out a few events, and get dinner around 7:30.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the AHA! website (note April's schedule won't be up until at least late March): &lt;a href="http://www.ahanewbedford.org/calendar.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ahanewbedf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can park for free on the street after 6, or if you decide to come earlier just bring a couple quarters for the meters.  I will meet people at 6pm at the National Park office, but I might get down there earlier, so if you want to come earlier just e-mail me and we'll meet up earlier.  I'll send out my cell number the day before to Yes responders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come out for a night of free entertainment!  Hope to see you there.  This is a joint event with The South Shore 30+ Singles Meetup and WINGS.  Please RSVP on just one site.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.  Check out my picture!
