They defy labels, and at times, good taste. Theyâ€™ve performed together for 30 years; skewering the genre of magic, their sold-out audiences, and themselves -- very often all at the same time, within one mind-boggling evening. Together since 1975, their award-winning theater show has been a long running hit on and off-Broadway. The duo keeps a busy touring schedule, performing live more than 100 times this year alone.  Favorite guests on &amp;quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Late Show with David Letterman,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Live! with Regis &amp;amp; Kathie Lee,&amp;quot; Penn &amp;amp; Teller have made dozens of television appearances including, &amp;quot;Late Night with Conan O'Brien,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Today Show&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Saturday Night Live.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are on sale beginning February 23 at 9am, for $20 - $40. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested in overnight, carpooling, etc., let us please coordinate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243198513000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234756800000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Penn &amp; Teller at Foxwoods</name><id>9749956</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242946800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/9749956/</event_url></item>
