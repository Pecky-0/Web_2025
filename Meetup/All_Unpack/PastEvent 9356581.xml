Yet Rand loved secular Christmas, and only towards the end of her life made it a policy of not accepting gifts. We don't know why her attitude changed, but her writings—especially in Atlas Shrugged—reveal her thoughts towards giving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Kelley, an objectivist scholar, calls gifting, &amp;quot;a kind of investment,&amp;quot; as well as an egoistic value of benefaction. He views giving as a way to enable the success of someone you love or admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your opinion, please bring your thoughts to our Salon and join us in celebrating the giving season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: Sunday, December 21, 11am&lt;br /&gt;Where: White Horse Tavern, 116 Brighton Ave., Allston, MA&lt;br /&gt;Why: Because omelets with candy canes are scrumptious&lt;br /&gt;What: RSVP so we will reserve a spot for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food is $10.45/person, but the conversation is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumor has it Santa will be making the rational sojourn as well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232153499000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229571827000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Rationality of Gift-Giving</name><id>9356581</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229875200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/9356581/</event_url></item>
