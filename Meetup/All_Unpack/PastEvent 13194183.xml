YOU MISSED YOUR CHANCE!     This may be your only chance this season to meet Red Sox Natives Member Kevin Perito!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin will be driving up from Rhode Island to attend the Sox game, and this is our chance to personally welcome a Rhode Island member to the Natives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Game On! bar, and listen as Kevin speaks of his lifelong journey from Bellingham MA to Rumford, RI. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So join us for a random kick off to a Saturday night in Boston, then stick around to watch the Sox game with your fellow Natives while Kevin ditches us for the live action of Fenway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all you who join and say you want to come out to watch a game with other Sox fans, here is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon</member_name><member_id>6918204</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin Perito</member_name><member_id>11798249</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272327741000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271364321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet Kevin Perito!</name><id>13194183</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272146400000</time><rsvp_limit>2</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/13194183/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/4/global_14392532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
