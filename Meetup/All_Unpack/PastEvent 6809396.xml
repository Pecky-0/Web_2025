It'd be great if we could get a bunch of us there in our Ron Paul gear showing our support. I know the Harvard Students for Ron Paul facebook group is already trying to drum up some people to go, but the group is small. I think it'd really make a statement to have a great showing of Paul support at such a prestigious political venue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts at 8 PM and is free to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 8:00 pm - 11:00 pm&lt;br /&gt;Location: John F.
