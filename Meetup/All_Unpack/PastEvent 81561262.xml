<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Competitive runners or light recreational joggers - this is a great event to test your speed or to exercise and have fun, all for a great cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and join us as participants or spectators. If people are up for it, we'll all go out and have lunch after the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up beforehand at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brianhonan.org/"&gt;http://brianhonan.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or on race day. Comes with a free long sleeve T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who have registered already, you probably have received an email regarding number and T shirt pick up on Saturday, from 11:00am—3:00pm at the New Balance Retail Store, 40 Life St. Brighton.  Or Sunday starting at 10am at Tavern in the Square.  Those who haven't registered, you can register and pick up number/t-shirt at the square. After the run/walk, a few of us are planning to have lunch at JoJo Taipei close by.  I was also informed by Steve that there will be the annual Allston Village Street Fair from 12-6pm.  So get there early.  If you want to meet up before or after the race, you can give me a call at my cell:   &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;617-510-4895&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If I don't see you, best of luck on the race!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alan</member_name><member_id>10052076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348483949000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347199484000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brian J Honan 5K run/walk 2012</name><id>81561262</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>3600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348415100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/81561262/</event_url></item>
