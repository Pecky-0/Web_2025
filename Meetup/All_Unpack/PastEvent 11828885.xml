Please bring an item (if you have one) that represents/reminds you of your alfar - these items will NOT be offered in sacrifice but will be gathered together to form the ancestor altar. We will write their names in the Ancestor Book, and the names will be read out as part of the ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two Ravens Kindred has a &amp;quot;vouch safe&amp;quot; policy for anyone who has never been to one of our private events before.  In order to vouch for you, we need to meet for coffee/tea/beer first (or given that only a week remains and I'm dealing with a transportation snag, at LEAST have a decent phone conversation beforehand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are interested, then don't delay... call or email soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wassail,&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;(203) 870-5389&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>(fictitious address... call or email for directions and additional info)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Hicks</member_name><member_id>3427608</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258399169000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Followers of Asatru</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>asatru-242</urlname><id>369297</id><group_lat>41.8600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut &amp; Western Mass Asatru Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257733056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TRK Midwinter/Alfar Blot</name><id>11828885</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258225200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/asatru-242/events/11828885/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/5/global_11718437.jpeg</photo_url></item>
