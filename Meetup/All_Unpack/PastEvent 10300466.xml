He promised us that he would be brief, could ask the questions and shoot the film all in one day, and so we agreed to do the interview. Not only was Peter true to his word, arriving at our Abraham-Hicks Conference center with a big truck full of cameras, camera men, lighting and all manner of impressive equipment, but his interview questions evoked from us and from Abraham a dynamic interview full of incredible new insights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we watch this DVD and relive the interview with Peter plying Abraham with his hard-hitting and broad range of questions, we are reminded again of the brilliance and love of Abraham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter has scored this wonderful trilogy with some of the finest music available on the planet today. The combination of Peter’s remarkable questions, Abraham’s remarkable answers and this amazing blending of music and wonderful photography from Peter’s talented group at Aura Productions, makes this a product we are very proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This interview was taped just a few weeks before Rhonda Byrne (and The Secret film crew) joined us on our Alaskan cruise to film our part of the movie, The Secret. This DVD contains important Source material that was not included in The Secret movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************************************** &lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP here&lt;/b&gt; so we'll meetup at the Hotel.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243990037000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241061725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special Event: Take A Giant Step - The Director's Tour  re: Abraham Hicks</name><id>10300466</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243724400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/10300466/</event_url></item>
