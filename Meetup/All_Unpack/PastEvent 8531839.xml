The September meeting will be a week later than normal, Tuesday September 16th.  As I said at the meeting I would appreciate any donations you could make to cover the costs of the meeting which run about $350 a year.  To date I have collected $20 each from two attendees and a few more dollars from another.  Please send your checks to me at 9710 W. Hatcher Rd. Peoria AZ 85345 if you are able to donate any amount to defray my costs first years costs.  Now that I am traveling from AZ each month I could use the help. The library doesn't allow any collections on property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next meeting please come with a list of information you would like to cover in the coming months and if you would like to see any practitioners give presentations ontechniques or treatments that interest you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in September!!!
