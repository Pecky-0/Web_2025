I am so let's enjoy good cheap eats. Dim sum is a very affordable and delicious feast. It's family dining which means sharing. We select food from carts that are wheeled to our table. The price for each person shouldn't be anymore than $15 but most likely $10. You can also order separately from a menu...safe but not as adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll gather outside at &lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:45 AM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then we'll head inside at 11:00 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this helpful &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~pam_phillips/TCC4335/index.html"&gt;dim sum primer&lt;/a&gt; written by Pam Phillips who is a fellow meetup member&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules of Engagement for This Meetup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is less than an hour from the meal and you are unable to attend or are running late, you MUST contact me by calling or texting me at (617) 445-7549 or email at snowrover@yahoo.com, so either don't wait for you unnecessarily or to save a seat for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this meetup is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP and if you answered the RSVP questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the meetup and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within an hour of the meetup, without contacting me, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will arrive at Hei La Moon by 10:45 AM to arrange seating as well as welcome you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text my cell (617) 445 7549</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318264150000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317292862000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hei La Moon Dim Sum Sunday October 9th</name><id>35437432</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318172400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/35437432/</event_url></item>
