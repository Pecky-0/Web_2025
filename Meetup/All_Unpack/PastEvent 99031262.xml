&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant, event and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Eddy - on Eddy Street between Westminster and Waybosset in DownCity Providence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there's a new little hotspot in town! Where is it, you ask? It's so new you may not even know where it is, but maybe you've noticed the sign if you happened to look up while walking down Eddy street at the corner of Westminster in DownCity. Newly opened at the end of December, its been several months in the making (I've been watching) and it's very exciting to see this new addition join the DownCity nightlife! With a peek in a week or so ago, it looks like it can hold us and is perfect for a Monday Night Meetup, with a bar and environment in which mingling and chatting is encouraged! Whoo hoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reviews from a few P-Collective members is that the snacks and drinks are great and personally, the mix and match Charcuterie &amp;amp; Cheese plate looks like a winner to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good food, good drink and good cheer, it really doesn't get better than that, does it? So let's give The Eddy a go THIS Monday night, and let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy and NYE 2012.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing the scarf or hat in the picture, but we're not hard to find!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
