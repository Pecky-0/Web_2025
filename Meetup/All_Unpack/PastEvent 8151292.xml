We'll have a picnic with bocce playing, cards/board games at the picnic table and we'll be cooking stuff on the habachis there. Linda is providing the Saugies (Rhode Island hot dogs), and please feel free to bring your own grill items or a dish to share. &amp;quot;BYOB, but any hooch would have to be under wraps because I'm sure it is not officially allowed at the park. Please feel encouraged to bring your own yard games (horseshoes, volleyball, kickball)!  There are other activities such as horseback riding and golf at this park (our picnic spot is right next to the golf course!), not to mention that it is on Narragansett Bay, and it has a beach of sorts (not RI's best in my opinion, but hey, it's a place to get a tan started if you want!) and/or you could put a boat or kayak in if you want to, using their boat launch.&amp;quot;  Check out the Rhode Island State Park website (scroll waaay down after clicking Goddard Memorial State Park):  &lt;a href="http://www.riparks.com/goddard.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.riparks.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  There is no charge to enter the park!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your way home we can stop and see Waterfire up in Providence!  We are meeting others on the patio at Citron, right next to Waterplace Park (near Capital Grill) around sunset (8:30!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at grill # 3!
