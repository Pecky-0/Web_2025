The Harvard Museum of Natural History has an exciting series of lectures and classes that address these subjects. After all, the more we know about ourselves and our planet, the better life choices we can make.  This week's event is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep Ancestry: Inside the Genographic Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; - Lecture and booksigning by Spencer Wells &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Population geneticist Spencer Wells has traced the genetic trail of our ancestors as they ventured out of Africa to inhabit every continent. By analyzing the DNA of isolated tribes around the globe, Wells and his colleagues have traced all humans alive today to a small tribe of hunter-gatherers who lived in Africa 60,000 years ago. Following the lecture, Wells will sign copies of his 2002 book, The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey. Cosponsored by the Harvard Foundation. Free and open to the public at 24 Oxford Street in the Geological Lecture Hall.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Note: I will be unable to attend this event. Michael will be outside the lecture hall afterwards, in case anyone would like to head to the Temple Bar or the West Side Lounge for a brew. Look for a navy blue and argyle sweater. Thanks Mike.
