Jonah Hex. Who I don't know much about beyond that he is a disfigured bounty hunter in the Old West who is dead or was dead or something, and he's good at making other characters dead, no confusion there, and that if Batman time travels to the 1800's he is guarranteed to run into Jonah Hex.

[b]Details[/b]

The time of the movie is 7:10. I will be at the theater at 6:40. We should head in and get seats at 6:55.

I will wear my red meetup hat. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables by the big window. If the movie is downstairs, I'll be waiting behind the rope across from the refreshment stand. I'll be at the theater 30 minutes before showtime, and we should go in and get seats 15 minutes before showtime.

I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.

If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a scarred drifter and bounty hunter of last resort, a tough and stoic gunslinger who can track down anyone... and anything. Having survived death, Jonah's violent history is steeped in myth and legend, and has left him with one foot in the natural world and one on the "other side." His only human connection is with Leila (Megan Fox), whose life in a brothel has left her with scars of her own. But Jonah's past is about to catch up with him when the U.S. military makes him an offer he can't refuse: in exchange for his freedom from the warrants on his head, he must track down and stop the dangerous terrorist Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). But Turnbull, who is gathering an army and preparing to unleash Hell, is also Jonah's oldest enemy and will stop at nothing until Jonah is dead. Based on the legendary graphic novel, "Jonah Hex" is an epic adventure thriller about one man's personal quest for redemption against the vast canvas of the battle between good and evil.
