How can I learn to commune with my own soul?&lt;br /&gt;Come to this class to learn, in a practical way, what your soul is and how to connect with it.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful 6-week introductory course designed for modern mystics. Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation that will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within. In each class we explore three areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Understanding the universe materially and spiritually, the Laws and Beings that govern it, and our roles as living, conscious humans in that cosmos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Spiritual exercises designed to help you develop skills needed for inner work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Hands-on experiences, through which you can learn to see, hear, and feel the spiritual world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The class is free, but RSVP is required. Late admittance may be permissible (after the first week of the class), but check with the organizer to be sure. Completion of this series can lead into more advanced classes for those who are interested. &lt;br /&gt;The class is offered on Thursday evenings at 7:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
