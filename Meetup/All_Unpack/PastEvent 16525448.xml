&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come and join me in watching the Oscars this year. &amp;nbsp;Bring a snack or drink to share. &amp;nbsp;I will try to come up with some Oscar-related games to play too. &amp;nbsp;Or I have tons of board games that have been popular to play at my past Oscar parties if you guys are feeling up to it. Hope to see you there! &amp;nbsp;My number is 503-784-2792 if you have any questions or need help finding my place. &amp;nbsp;There is a lot of parking available on the street during the weekends too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298859383000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>I am a huge movie nut and always enjoy watching the Oscars but it is even more fun to watch it with lots of cool people.</why><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297394457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oscar Party</name><id>16525448</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298854800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/16525448/</event_url></item>
