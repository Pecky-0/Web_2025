<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Chris Young was arrested and charged for speaking out against the Health Care Bill and giving Patrick Kennedy a DVD at one of the recent Town Hall Forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chris Young court date is on Feb 17 at 8 AM outside the Providence Municipal Court House (with the glass windows). Also, feel free to stop by and join the group protesting the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not agree with all that Chris believes, but his 1st Amendment Right was clearly violated. There is no law about speaking too long or too loudly at a Town Hall Forum, or gently lobbing a DVD toward a table to the open hands of a Congressman who can't catch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(from):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/We-The-People-Of-Rhode-Island/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>7163979</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347732910000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Rhode Island Oath Keepers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Rhode-Island-Oath-Keepers</urlname><id>1425841</id><group_lat>41.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Oath Keepers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264819343000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SUPPORT CHRIS YOUNG!</name><id>12464027</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266411600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Oath-Keepers/events/12464027/</event_url></item>
