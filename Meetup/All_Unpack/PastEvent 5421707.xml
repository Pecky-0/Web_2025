For first time our group will be going to the Loew's Boston Common Multiplex (yes, it hurt to type that-just joking) with the idea that we will get a larger screen than what is offered at Harvard Square. And, since I am anticipating that we will have a large group, we could then go to a Chinatown restaurant which would be able to accommodate all of  us.  My vote is for Pho Pastuer's, but I would definitely like to hear your suggestions as well, for where to go afterward-send me an e-mail.  I have the remainder of the week to make the reservation.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now,please change your RSVP from Maybe to Yes or No, when you know whether you can attend or not. This will make it much easier to for me to make the reservation for the restaurant afterward.  As of Wednesday, Jan 31, you may only RSVP Yes or No.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, look for me, near the front row at the movies end with  a Meetup sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is one of many outstanding reviews: &lt;a href="http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-061229-movies-review-labyrinth,0,7134601.story?coll=mmx-movies_top_heds" target="_blank"&gt;http://metromix.chica...&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom   &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170804351000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169669596000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pan's Labyrinth on Super Bowl Sunday</name><id>5421707</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170622800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5421707/</event_url></item>
