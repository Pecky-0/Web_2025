I am hoping for Depeche Mode (Just can't get enough), New Order (Blue Monday, Bizzare Love Triangle, Ceremony), Whodini (Freaks Come out At Night), Run DMC, Talking Heads, the Cure, the Smiths, Bauhaus, P.I.L. and no Duran Duran or Michael Jackson.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whatever Heroes spins, WE WILL HAVE GOOD TIME, SOLDIER!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to come after I contact the venue and know the head count.  There is a $7 dollar cover.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get us advance tickets (usually there are none for non-concert night), if you RSVP and pay $7.42 ($7 cover +$0.42 transaction fee charged by meet up/amazon) by April 2 at 4 pm.  The tickets allow you to get in even if they are at capacity and do not let anyone else in.  My cell is 617-470-6212 so I can come out and give you the tix you purchased.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU &lt;b&gt;RSVP AND PAY&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SEND ME AN EMAIL&lt;/b&gt; SO I CAN GET YOU AN ADVANCE TICKET.  Meetup does not let me know who has paid and who hasn't (only our fearless leader Roger is privy to that information)!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will look AWESOME and geek it up with a balloon.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amir Rezaizadeh</member_name><member_id>7082075</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262050045000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Night Lifers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonnights</urlname><id>860845</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Nights</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237988018000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DJ Chris Ewen AKA Heroes spins 80's new wave at T.T.The Bear's Place</name><id>10031869</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238893200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonnights/events/10031869/</event_url></item>
