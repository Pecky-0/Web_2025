Even if you are not currently considering using an automated trading system, this talk will help you understand trading using a system and to some extent how the black boxes on Wall Street work.  I think this will prove to be a highly informantive talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John started Trade Vest LLC which primarily focused on equities and options trading in the electronic arena from 1996 -2001. He wrote many proprietary trading applications and managed the IT. John was a founding and managing member of NT Financial Group from 2001 to 2003, a CBT member firm which focused on high level arbitrage modeling. In 2003 John started Trade Angle Strategies, along with partners Eddie Katinas and Keith Doolittle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathematics and Statistics degree from North Carolina State University, PASCAL, JAVA, C++, and proprietary database applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trade Angle Strategies LLC (TAS) is a developer of Automated Trading Systems, Analytical Tools, and other Educational Products.
