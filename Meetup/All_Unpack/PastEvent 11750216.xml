By providing custom vibrational sound journeys we balance energetic and anatomical systems for optimal personal wellness. The mediums we use to share our craft are antique Himalayan singing bowls and planetary gongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a 20-minute introduction on vibration, intention and positive thinking. Then we give an easy lesson on ringing the Tibetan bowls.  We harness the sonic and energetic offerings and treat everyone to a personal demonstration in our vibrational bath using our powerful Gongs, bowls, and other tools.  We explain and discuss the various concepts surrounding the mystery of our profession.  We address topics such as Vibrational medicine, Chakras, and Binaural Beats among many others.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing specifically tuned Gongs, The Conduits healing abilities become comprehensible.  Planetary Gongs correspond to targeted human physiology. The gong at the feet is tuned to the frequency of the Earth, which restores balance and has a grounding effect. While the gong at the head, is tuned to the frequency of the Sun. This is a mystical sound we like to call the “Sound of Creation”.  Other planetary gongs as well as Antique singing bowls and tingshas are used during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water makes up 70% of our physical form, which allows the frequencies and vibrations of these celestial realms to travel through our bodies in a rippling effect. The vibration and sound melt away tension and put you in total state of comfort and relaxation.  This allows your body, mind and spirit to tune itself to its own natural frequency. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workshop fee is $50 (We ask you pre-register and pre-pay for logistical reasons.  THANKS!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Owen James</member_name><member_id>10503612</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257790745000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256922495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Afternoon of Vibrational Self-Healing</name><id>11750216</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257616800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/11750216/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/b/global_11515771.jpeg</photo_url></item>
