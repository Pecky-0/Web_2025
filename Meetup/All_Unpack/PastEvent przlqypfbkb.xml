&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Bee&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; by Chris Cleave&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishers of Chris Cleave's new novel "don't want to spoil" the  story by revealing too much about it, and there's good reason not to  tell too much about the plot's pivot point. All you should know going in  to &lt;em&gt;Little Bee&lt;/em&gt; is that what happens on the beach is brutal, and  that it braids the fates of a 16-year-old Nigerian orphan (who calls  herself Little Bee) and a well-off British couple--journalists trying to  repair their strained marriage with a free holiday--who should have  stayed behind their resort's walls. The tide of that event carries  Little Bee back to their world, which she claims she couldn't explain to  the girls from her village because they'd have no context for its  abundance and calm. But she shows us the infinite rifts in a globalized  world, where any distance can be crossed in a day--with the right  papers--and "no one likes each other, but everyone likes U2." Where you  have to give up the safety you'd assumed as your birthright if you  decide to save the girl gazing at you through razor wire, left to the  wolves of a failing state.&lt;/p&gt;
