I made a scheduling error as I had promised to do some Wednesdays but since I  already have RSVPs I will leave it as Tuesday. I have scheduled out some more meetups in the summer and have included Wednesdays.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our April meetup will be held on Tuesday, April 13th from 7-8:30pm. Be sure to mark it on your calendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you all can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We usually meet in the front room given space.
