They have 10+ tables and it is rarely very busy. They have a full bar, food and many TV's. 2 TV's are huge-I think at least 10' or 12' wide! &lt;br /&gt;I will give free pool lessons to anyone who desires during the first hour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menu link &lt;a href="http://www.thebreweryexchange.com/pubmenu.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is the Brewery Exchange located? &lt;br /&gt;The Brewery Exchange is located at 201 Cabot Street in Lowell, MA.
