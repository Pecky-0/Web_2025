&lt;p&gt;Recreational - Players possessing basic skills/fundamentals of the  game.    Laid-back game with focus on repetition of the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low   Intermediate - Players with some experience playing in informal     settings (family gatherings, etc) Should be familiar with 4-2  formation    (middle front setter).  The entrance to the gym is on  Cambridge Street   opposite Harvard Market.  The nearest intersection to  the entrance is   Cambridge Street and Roberts  Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Please RSVP if you  plan on attending. RSVP's will close on the day   of  the game at 11 AM.  If you show up at the game but do not have a   "Yes"  RSVP, you will not  be guaranteed to get playing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Please be serious about RSVP's. If  you RSVP "Yes" and don't show   up,  it means you have prevented someone  else from attending. Also,   please  change your RSVP if you find out you  can't play, as soon as   possible.  Changing the RSVP a few hours before  the game time means   that there will  be less people who can play, as  most people prefer   some advance notice  that there are spots available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of the meetup will be $5. Please pay the organizer when you     arrive before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of   the   court rental.  The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is   about a  ten minute walk  from the T stop.  Parking near the school on   Sundays  is generally easy to find, as meters  and residential parking   rules are  generally not enforced on Sundays  (parking signs should say   "EX SUNDAY"  or similar).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lilly will be hosting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>10355700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>16</waitlist_count><updated>1298837482000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1298309552000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Recreational/Low Intermediate Indoor Volleyball</name><id>16646206</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298833200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/16646206/</event_url></item>
