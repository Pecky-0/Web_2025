Lets taste the beers that others enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time for the great American Monday night football game and what better way to spend it than together with a beer tasting night.  I don't have a lot of places to sit in front of the giant TV screen so it will be limited and besides it's a quick idea.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Monday, November 29th&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;San Francisco VS Arizona&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, it's a game night anyway.  Bring your best 12 pack of beer to share with the rest.  Go home with whatever you brought that's left.  We'll all try to help finish it. &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;drink responsibly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;  Limited to 12 people so we should be able to all watch the game.  If it works out, I can turn on HD for the next one.  The pregame starts at 8:30 so come at 8 pm.  Bring some chips/dips too.  It's open to all so let's mix it up.  We can put the couch to use for as many fannies we can put on to it.  If you don't know where, directions will be sent out to the people that respond YES.  It's limited so please respond if you plan to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;Ralph&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ralph</member_name><member_id>8774347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291168191000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
