But rarely does a person have the opportunity to study with someone who can bring so much 'to the table'.  How to explain the talents of Isabeau Esby. To the point, she is both out of this world and very much of this world.  A person of enormous spiritual gifts, experience and education, she has be ability to connect a person to metaphysical energies that allude most human beings. She is a successful medium, after all; it is her job to bridge both worlds. Yet she is a grounded mother of two who fully lives in everyday America and understands the challenges in melding spiritual exploration and practices with the pressures and practical demands of our lives. As with all good teachers, she is both an excellent listener and communicator. And her classes are fun! - those who expect discussions on spirituality to be ponderous and dreary will be disappointed with Isabeau's classes.  Her class has given me much to ponder and has allowed me to creatively explore the important life questions facing me now.  Quite frankly, I can hardly wait to get to class. Every time I go, I have one of those 'aha' moments that we hear Oprah talk about. It is quite addicting!  I believe anyone willing to make the time and the commitment will benefit greatly from Isabeau's class.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Webber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabeau Esby</member_name><member_id>5847842</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276130189000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274890888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spiritual Awakening and Psychic Development Intensive </name><id>13602151</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276126200000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/13602151/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/3/global_6795651.jpeg</photo_url></item>
