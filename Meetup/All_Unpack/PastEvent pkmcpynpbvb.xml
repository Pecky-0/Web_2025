You’ll also hear real people tell their stories of making remarkable recoveries with energetic “information-based” therapies. All presented in an easy-to-understand way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;This information has profound implications which support Law of Attraction principles. &lt;/span&gt; We found it to be totally inspiring and belief affirming. &lt;i&gt;If we have the power to heal our bodies with the right beliefs and thoughts, then we can apply that power and capability to other desires, too!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;If you practice or have had positive experiences with any kind of alternative healing therapy, please come and join us to share your experience with us and inspire us even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is 83 minutes long; so &lt;u&gt;please arrive on time, as it will be important for us to start promptly&lt;/u&gt;. We encourage you to linger &lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;afterwards&lt;/span&gt; to socialize, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much to those of you who have RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and showed up! PLEASE, PLEASE, only sign up if you really intend to show up. We set up our space, and prepare snacks and handouts accordingly. Also, we can only take a maximum of 20 people in our space, and do not want to exclude anyone unnecessarily because of a no-show. Help us reach our goal of 100% attendance for those who rsvp &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun!
