Senior groups are asked to call ahead to reserve space at (603)622-7531.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two old Friends return to the Millyard Museum to once again delight the audience with a combination of Irish music and American country music. With banjo, guitar, mandolin, concertina, bodran, octave mandolin and heart warming vocal harmonies, Two Old Friends tell a story in music of how immigrants came to this country from Ireland, Scotland and Great Britain, bringing their melodies and instruments. Mac and Hutch show how the old time country ballads of the Appalachians are rooted in these tunes. Their performance will give you plaintive ballads and foot stomping shout tunes; soaring mandolin solos, gospel sign-a-longs, traditional Irish tunes and story telling. There is truly something for everyone to enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mac McHale and Emery &amp;quot;Hutch&amp;quot; Hutchins are two of New Englandâ€™s most talented traditional musicians.  &lt;br /&gt;They were the founders and original long-time members of Northeast Winds. Mac, who lives in Kennebunk, Maine, heads up Mac McHale and the Old Time Radio Gang, and Hutch, of York, Maine, has been a key member of the Angel Band, a world famous Irish music group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Manchester Historic Association</member_name><member_id>10139829</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287516240000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>History fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-History-Network</urlname><id>1505455</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester History Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275157236000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Two Old Friends - concert at the Millyard Museum</name><id>13633688</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281805200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-History-Network/events/13633688/</event_url></item>
