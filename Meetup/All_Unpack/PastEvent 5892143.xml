Dinner will be buffet style and the menu is &amp;quot;Choose (3) from chicken, beef ribs, pork ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and brisket. Includes salad, cole slaw, beans and cornbread. Additional side orders may be ordered for $1.95 per person. Choose from rice, potato salad, baked potato homemade mashed potatoes, french fries or corn on the cob. Full Bar Air Conditioned Function Room. $18.95 per person&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;After dinner we can move the tables aside and do some dancing! They have satelite radio and we can bring CDs to give to the bartender to play - so bring your favorite dance music!
