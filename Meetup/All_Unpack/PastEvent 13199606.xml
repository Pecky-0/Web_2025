Its a little tough to find (they have a sign that's lit up now) but well worth it. Located in a neighborhood setting, its a small brick building that looks like the windows are boarded up. Just look for the cool sign over the doorway. Considered &amp;quot;a bit divey, but in a cool, hipster kinda way&amp;quot; and a great place to end a night on the West Side, its located in same area as the Avery (okay, you're almost an RI'er if you know where that is - I couldn't resist - LOL!). Be forewarned, they don't serve food, but the bartender has a plethora of menus to pick from for delivery - so its kind of the best of both worlds. So, back by request and popular demand, come over to E&amp;amp;O for some fun and good cheer this Monday night,  and let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Its a small place - you can't miss us!!! Just in case, I'll be wearing the fuzzy blue scarf (I think its the last appearance for that for awhile - hoping for Spring!)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
