In an effort to distinguish itself from other beers, Harpoon has always relied on word of mouth and customer experiences (tours, tastings and events) to market itself rather than traditional advertising. As a result of this customer-oriented approach, Harpoon is now the third largest brewery in New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harpoon brewery is accessible on the silver line: SL2 and SL3 stop directly in front of the brewery at the Harbor St stop. Please visit MBTA.com or the link below for more info on directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/index.cfm/page/DirectionsHours/pid/28490"&gt;http://www.harpoonbre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harpoon offers brewery tours Saturdays and Sundays which last about an hour, cost $5 at the door (a portion of which goes towards Harpoon Helps), and end with sampling of Harpoon beers. Tours are popular, so please arrive no later than 1:30pm to get tickets for the 2pm tour. We will meet outside the brewery at 1:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/index.cfm/page/TastingsTours/pid/28488"&gt;http://www.harpoonbre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tour, we will grab a bite to eat close by.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ritesh</member_name><member_id>4789957</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256649290000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254714084000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harpoon Brewery Tour</name><id>11548951</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256405400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11548951/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/d/global_8748557.jpeg</photo_url></item>
