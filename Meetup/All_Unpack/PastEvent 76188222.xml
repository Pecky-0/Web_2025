&lt;p&gt;"Summertime means relaxation and good times with friends. Is anyone interested in taking a 1 1/2 hour cruise around Salem Harbor while listening to sweet tunes? Mahi Mahi Cruises leave from Pickering Wharf in Salem, MA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what they have to say on their website: &lt;br /&gt;

Rock ‘n roll around Salem Sound to the tunes of Boston’s The Gravel Project performing original blues, funk and good-time groove music. Grab some friends or meet new ones as you enjoy an evening of live music, local brews and hot-off-the-grill food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note, the boat &lt;strong&gt;leaves at 7:30pm&lt;/strong&gt;, I listed the event time as 7pm so that we can gather on the dock and board together then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults: $15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can purchase tickets online on the Mahi Mahi website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mahicruises.com/MahiPress/portfolio_entries/finback/"&gt;http://mahicruises.com/MahiPress/portfolio_entries/finback/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A few people have had trouble with buying tickets.  Their website isn't the best. To get tickects, use the link above. The first thing you'll see says ""July 4th Fireworks Cruise," scroll down until you see "Live Blues, Local Brews, and Cruise." Click on the title and it will bring you to the cruise description. Click on "Get Your Tix Now". You then have to click "Buy Now." You can enter how many tickets you want and select Thursday 8/30/12 at 7:30."&lt;/p&gt;
