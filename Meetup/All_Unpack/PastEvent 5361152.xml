A min of 10 people need to RSVP to hold this event.&lt;br /&gt;Event Description: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask and ye shall receive. The group discussion made it clear everyone was looking to get out and off the computer to use their camera's. So let's check out some of the more photographable areas in New Engalnd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first shoot will be in scenic Rockport. On Sunday Jan 28th for an afternoon/ sunset shoot. I spoke to Mark Kanegis earlier today and he has, again, graciously opened his gallery as a meeting point for us. We will meet at 3pm at the Gallery (&lt;a href="http://kanegisgallery.com/)"&gt;http://kanegisgallery...&lt;/a&gt;. Sunset is at 5:06 so that should give us all plenty of time to work with the daylight. We will start the day off with a brief review of working with water and afternoon light by Mark. Then we can go out as a group or break up as each of us sees fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thesunrisetimes.com/Maine_to_Massachusetts/Rockport,_Massachusetts_.aspx"&gt;http://www.thesunrise...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sunset we will all meet over at the Gallery. Those interested we'll grab a bite to eat, maybe, The Fish Shack, which was very tasty the first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event IS CONFIRMED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced photographers please consider joining us and sharing you photographic knowledge on light and outdoor techniques.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170449903000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1167809784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rockport at Sunset</name><id>5361152</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170010800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/5361152/</event_url></item>
