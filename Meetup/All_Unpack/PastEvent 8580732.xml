Do you watch TV?  Movies? Listen to Music?  Eat? Good at History? Geography?  Everyone knows something about the world and can make a great contribution to the game as well as to the conversations around the tables while we play.  Come on out, socialize with the easiest group of people you'll ever make friends with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game starts at 8:30 and usually runs for about 2 hours.  I'll be there around 8:15 to get table(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a meetup sign on a table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221264521000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219195179000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>We Know Our Trivia @ Union Station</name><id>8580732</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221091200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/8580732/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
