So it's a very local activity this week.  We'll meet at Easton's Beach on our bikes, do a loop around scenic Ocean Drive, continue to Sachuets Point, walk a two and a half mile loop around the point, and ride back to the beach.  Then will have a well deserved lunch at Flos Clam Shack.  Although it sounds difficult, most of the route is flat, including the walk the doesn't have a single hill much to my disappointment!  The biking should total around 18 miles.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the &amp;quot;promised&amp;quot; sunny day this Saturday by the ocean. &lt;br /&gt;Paula&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the parking lot by the playground</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257776272000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257373945000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Keep Those Legs Moving Bike and Hike Last Minute Gathering</name><id>11796905</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257602400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/11796905/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/d/global_5864541.jpeg</photo_url></item>
