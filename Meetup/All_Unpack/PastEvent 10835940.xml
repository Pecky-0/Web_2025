Sweaters were essential garments for the fishermen of these islands because the natural oils within the wool provided some element of protection against the harsh weather encountered while out fishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many elaborate designs were developed, such as the cable stitch used on Aran sweaters, which was developed in the early 20th century in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261327014000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247107477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Warm &amp; Toasty Holiday Swap  -Thursday Dec 17th</name><id>10835940</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261092600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835940/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/e/global_9564798.jpeg</photo_url></item>
