Master Trainer Marilou Seavey will be will be co-facilitating this month's meetup with me.  Marilou has trained many of the Practitioners and Master Practitioners in the Boston area, and regularly trains groups around the world.  (See &lt;a href="http://www.mindbridgetraining.com/company-history/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mindbridge...&lt;/a&gt;  for more information about Marilou). Below are the details about the meetup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonightâ€™s topic: &amp;quot;Sleight of Mouth&amp;quot; language patterns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NLP's language patterns are some of the most useful tools in the NLP toolbox.  After all, we can't always command someone to close their eyes, or touch someone's arm to anchor them, but we can always talk to them!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will learn and practice some of the basic language patterns (how many depends on how fast we get through them).  We'll do two or more of the following patterns: redefines, verb relaxes, nominalizations, forced choice, nots, and/but, analog/digital shifts, or reversing presuppositions. If those names don't mean anything to you, don't worry: it will all become clear by the end of the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to discuss specific issues that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Marx&lt;br /&gt;NLP Master Practitioner&lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP&lt;br /&gt;317 N Main St, Natick MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;(617) 329-1657&lt;br /&gt;adam@NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;www.NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Helping you to become the you that you want to be:&lt;br /&gt;Coaching, Counseling, and Training&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk straight back into the meetup room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268171654000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263876234000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greater Boston NLP Feb Meetup - Using Language Patterns - Special Guest Trainer!</name><id>12359454</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267143300000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/12359454/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/0/global_11885328.jpeg</photo_url></item>
