It appears something was wrong with the log-in capabilities on this web page and I couldn't post until today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, the Council began the process of branding the Boston Arts and Entertainment Community.  By being both critical and optimistic, the Council was able to begin to shape the brand of what the Boston Arts and Entertainment Community is, and what it could be.  This week, the Council will continue that process of branding by becoming more focus in our agenda.  Please review the minutes from the last meeting for a refresher on what was covered.  Putting any bias or grievances aside, try and come up with an even more focused vision of what the Boston Arts and Entertainment Community is at this moment.  What is that vision, and what are some ways in which we can portray and promote that vision to others?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because we're at a stage where the more ideas and input we get, the more accurate our picture of Boston will be, please try and bring a friend to the Council this week.  If we're creating a vision of Boston Entertainment, it should be as accurate and universal as possible.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to thank everyone for their contributions last week.   The group is progressively gaining more continuity, which will undoubtedly as aid as we continue to grow and develop this idea of branding and promoting an Arts and Entertainment Community we are all passionate about.  Thanks again and I hope to see even more of you next Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Marston</member_name><member_id>2731493</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193436356000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>entrepreneur-674</urlname><id>232461</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Revolve Nation's Boston Entrepreneur Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192645555000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Next Week's Boston Entertainment Leadership Council Meeting</name><id>6567178</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193263200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/entrepreneur-674/events/6567178/</event_url></item>
