We'll run from the cafe to the river path, go west to Prospect Street, and double back along the river. Finishing up with one loop around the common to make it an even 2 miles; sprinting parts of the common loop encouraged but optional. Coffee/goodies at the cafe afterwards is also optional but highly recommended :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys just as an aside, my daughter would really like to see the attendance at this run grow. It's a fun, quick run and a great way to start a Saturday. There are 544 of you and I'm asking all of you to forward a link to this run to a teen you know. THANKS!&lt;/p&gt;
