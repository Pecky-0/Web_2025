This event is sponsored by Holyoke Community College and they are offering an introduction before the film as well as an opportunity to stay for a discussion afterwards.   This is the only screening, so I suggest you purchase your ticket in advance.  The movies is at 7:30 pm, let's meet in the lobby at 7:10 pm if you'd like to sit together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some info on the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stunning film takes place in the Southern French city of Sète where Slimane, the patriarch of a large and vivacious North African family, is an elderly dockworker. When his job of many years is suddenly no longer secure, he decides to restore an old boat, and turn it into a floating couscous restaurant. It’s a wildly ambitious &lt;br /&gt;project, and the increasingly ailing Slimane will need the help of all of his family members in order to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Romy</member_name><member_id>8392408</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316475874000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernmassfrenchclub</urlname><id>1101087</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Western Mass French Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284478449000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Soiree Cinema: La Graine et le Mulet</name><id>14766247</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287530100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernmassfrenchclub/events/14766247/</event_url></item>
