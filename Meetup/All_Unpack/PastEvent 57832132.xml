&lt;p&gt;We can hang out and play games. I have all sorts of board, DVR or card games but if you have a fun one, please bring it. I may even open up my pool table for you, if you're good. lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For food, let's do pizza. Please bring cash for this and we'll place the order that day (unless it's like Christmas and every place is closed - I will update when it gets closer) or snacks to share. BYOB (b = beer or beverage - whichever you prefer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: I have 3 crazy dogs who will go nuts when you first get here or even later if you tease them, but eventually they may want to cuddle all over you so please let me know if you have allergies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will email about my address to RSVPed members - if you don't get it, text/call 203-805-8279</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andi</member_name><member_id>14218596</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337279357000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332719824000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easter Sunday - Food &amp; Games</name><id>57832132</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333900800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/57832132/</event_url></item>
