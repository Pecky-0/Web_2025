This is not a Singles Party. Meaning anyone can come, including couples. All are welcome to Party and Socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Kitty O’Sheas is in Boston (near Faneuil Hall) 131 State St Boston, MA 02109 [masked] Website &lt;a href="http://www.kittyosheasboston.com/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kittyosheasboston.com/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.kittyoshea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd floor holds 160 people with 4 huge comfy couches, AC, its own DJ area + dance floor, plus its own bathrooms so we truly have out own private party. 3 Bartender covering 2 bars upstairs. I paid $300 appetizers (Wings/veggie platter, cheeses etc) in advance since their Kitchen is too small to accommodate food for 160 members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: Music will medium levels in main room upstairs. Music will be tuned very low in the back room so members will have a separate area to chat. Till 9PM then the Dancing + Loud Music starts. Pease do not complain since people came to dance after 9PM + hear music.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get in tell Security at the stairs you are with Social Fun to get in (Even if you are with a different group). If you say ANY other group they will not let you in. Then walk upstairs to meet and greet Biagio your Host for the night. Please say your name and what group you are with. Then please give Biagio&lt;br /&gt;$5 to covers the cost to rent the whole 2nd floor, 3 bartenders +the DJ so its not all just to cover the food. Please no one dollar bills. Please have $5 ready in hand at the top of the stairs if you take too long Security will make members to go back downstairs. Sorry we cannot block the stairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Everyone, but the Invited Meetup group Head Organizers pays $5.&lt;br /&gt;2. After 9PM you will have to pay another $10 as a cover charge for the Bar Entrance fee to get in so that $15 total. $10 to bar and $5 to cover the cost for Biagio to rent the 2nd floor.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you get in before 9PM you ONLY have to pay $5 to Biagio to cover the cost to rent.&lt;br /&gt;4. It will be packed. get there early to ensure you can get in.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you come after 7:30PM you might not even get in right away and you will have to wait in line downstairs to go upstairs. Last time late comers had to wait over half an hour to get in!
