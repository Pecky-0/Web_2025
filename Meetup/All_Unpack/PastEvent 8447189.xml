<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be the first Meetup for this group so we will begin by reviewing the origin and major tenents of A Course in Miracles, sharing our own experience with the Course (new or old), and talk about how we would like the group to function.  I have many ideas but would like to hear what others are looking for as well.  I am very excited about connecting with others interested in A Course in Miracles!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Theresa</member_name><member_id>4688183</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223241520000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Students of ACIM</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>acim-309</urlname><id>1241028</id><group_lat>41.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Connecticut A Course In Miracles Study Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217502699000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New ACIM Group Starting</name><id>8447189</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222038000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/acim-309/events/8447189/</event_url></item>
