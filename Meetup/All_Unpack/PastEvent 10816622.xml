It's time for some fun and summery outdoor events.  Join us for river tubing in Farmington, CT on Sat, July 11th at 2pm.  Please see the attached website for instructions to get there and rules etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.farmingtonrivertubing.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.farmington...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 2 hours drive from Boston so I recommend people carpooling there.  When you RSVP, please indicate if you can provide a ride and the area that you live in.  If you need ride, please make a note of that as well.  We suggest riders to contribute $10/person to the driver. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have an optional early dinner get together after river tubing on that day. Location TBD.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  $20/person (cost of tubing &amp;amp; pay at admission office) + $1 meetup fee = $21.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your change of clothes &amp;amp; sandals that you can wear in the water.  Wear your sandals during tubing! Bring something to drink, sun block, sunglasses, hat, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water is very shallow for most of the way.  However, there might be some deep spots.  Doggy style swimming is all you need to survive here if you fall in the water.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Tran: 781-484-7913. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or Tony: 774-279-3431&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at admission office!!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tony / Pei</member_name><member_id>8262284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249082327000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246921152000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Farmington River Tubing</name><id>10816622</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247335200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/10816622/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/0/global_9534928.jpeg</photo_url></item>
