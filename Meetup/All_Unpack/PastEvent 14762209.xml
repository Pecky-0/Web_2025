We need to know as soon as possible how many folks would like to come so we can reserve tables! We will not be doing an organized Break the Fast the night before so we thought this might be a lot of fun! Susan Kaufman is the organizer for this event! This is not like any other chinese restaurant experience; the food is rolled around on carts and contains different kinds of dim sum that contain pork and shrimp for the most part.  You should expect to spend $15/per person.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ellen</member_name><member_id>4148667</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan </member_name><member_id>5355809</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285113599000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284435103000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A new way to Break the Fast the next day at China Pearl! </name><id>14762209</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284913800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/14762209/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/1/global_8354193.jpeg</photo_url></item>
