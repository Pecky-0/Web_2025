<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This one is a fundraiser held at the historic Life Saving Station in Nahant - see the restored interior of this landmark building and participate in a wine tasting while munching on cheese and crackers by the sea. The bar will be open from 4-6pm. Space is limited, so come early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menfolk are also invited to this public event! Some folks may want to grab dinner afterwards&amp;nbsp; before heading home. Recommended: The Blue Ox in Lynn for a special meal or one of the many restaurants in Vinnin Square Swampcott like Panera, Uno's, or Bertucci's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just $10. Wines will also be on sale and a portion of those proceeds will be donated to the continued restoration and adaptive re-use of historic buildings and open space in Nahant.&lt;/p&gt;
