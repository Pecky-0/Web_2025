Would anyone like to join? &lt;a href="http://www.blackcatroadrace.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.blackcatro...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331039556000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330473528000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Black Cat Road Race 20 Mile Relay, Salem, MA Sunday, March 4</name><id>54249442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330866000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/54249442/</event_url></item>
