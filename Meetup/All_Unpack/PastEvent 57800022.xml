Bring a headlamp or flashlight in the event that we are out just past "sunset". This is not a trip for beginners who have no experience paddling and staying with a group.  I do not plan to cancel the meetup due to less than perfect weather.  If you plan to attend, it would be good to have some rain gear available, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parking and launch is on Route 135 between Hopkinton and Westborough centers, 42.24166 North and 71.57316 West&lt;/p&gt;
