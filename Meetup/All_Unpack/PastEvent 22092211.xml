Do you have a book that you enjoyed and would like to pass on to someone else? Or maybe a book that's not your type, but someone else may enjoy? Then join us for dinner and book swap at Back Bay Social Club. We will enjoy dinner, then swap books. Book swap is optional. you can still come and enjoy dinner and hanging out. This is always a popular event! Please be sure that your books are in excellent condition, may be hardcover or paperback. Please no textbooks! You may bring two or three books if you would like. Please know that once you swap books, your original books will not be returned to you. Everyone pays for their own food/drink. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo)  near hostess stand or at our table.
