<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a re-post in order to send out the email to everyone - &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet this Saturday at Conard after having a nice turnout last week. Since we ran into court availability issues this past Saturday, let's do the following each week. Everyone should gather at the bleachers located at the far-right end of the courts, closest to the school. This should help coordinate the group and make it easier for newcomers to find us. In the event that there's another tournament that takes up all the courts, meeting at the bleachers is the first thing we'll do. After that (or if you're late), head over to Wolcott Park on New Britain Ave. Get to Wolcott by leaving the tennis parking lot and taking a right. At the stop sign, go left and proceed to the stop light. That's New Britain Ave. Just go straight across into the park, you'll see the sign and the courts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure I'll be there but keep an eye out for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me with any questions or comments...860-559-7983. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219064644000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218679198000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Updated - Tennis on Saturday 8/16</name><id>8540488</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218891600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/8540488/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
