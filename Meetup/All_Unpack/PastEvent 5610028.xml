After the meeting at 3:00.. people that wish to become a member of the board we will meet and make decisions.   We will need to decide what type of charity we want to become. Are we going to rescue? Are we going to be a fund raiser for medical needs? Are we going to do both?  We will need to vote in a president, treasurer,  co-signer and other board members, such as media person, and secretary.  All ideas will be welcome.   Please excuse the short notice, as I am going to be out of commission for a little while, and I wanted to get in a meeting before my treatment.   Pug Hugs to all, Feel free to call me or email me at nhpugsrus@aol.com or 641-3628  &lt;br /&gt;   Patty&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541198000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175015442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PUG MEET UP</name><id>5610028</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175446800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/5610028/</event_url></item>
