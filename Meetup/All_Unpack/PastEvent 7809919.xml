If you weren't aware, David runs a Frisbee group through Meetup which is starting to meet again now that it is nice outside.  For the first few Meetups of the group this season, we will go ahead and double post the events in case any of you are interested.  After the first few weeks, they will just show up on our calendar but not as game group events.  Should you be interested in playing, think about joining the Frisbee group, and if you RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to an event, please only do it on one of the sites.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://ultimatefrisbee.meetup.com/172/"&gt;http://ultimatefrisbe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is now spectacular, so its definitely time to start playing on the Common. I will cross-list this event on Craig's list and the Salem forums, and I will also post fliers at some local Salem businesses and Salem State (if possible). If we have enough interest we will definitely do a casual game of Ultimate, but even if the turnout is lower we can still do small-group appropriate games or just toss around. If you have no familiarity with Ultimate or with frisbee in general, there will certainly be opportunities to learn, and I will make a concerted effort to keep get everyone involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Wednesday somewhat randomly, so if there is a better evening during the week or a preference for weekends, please let me know. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing folks next Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for David in the middle of the Common--he's tall with red hair and will most likely be trying to throw a frisbee to himself until everyone shows up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210013158000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209130106000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come play frisbee</name><id>7809919</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209591900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7809919/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/e/1/global_3911857.jpeg</photo_url></item>
