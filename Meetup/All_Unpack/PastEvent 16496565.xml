Only a small section of the bar seating will be reserved; this is a casual gathering, and guests will be able to find their own seats in the restaurant, and order their own food and drinks, as they would on any other Saturday night. Of course, this isn't your typical Saturday night with a crowd of anonymous human beings. This is a coming-together of highly evolved primates, to enjoy camaraderie and to express their esteem for Charles Darwin and his theories of our origins. The organizers will provide nametags, free cake, and supplies and instructions for a Make-your-own Hopeful Monster activity, the results of which will be posted in an online gallery as evidence of the only kind of intelligent design. All persons of good, Darwinian character are invited to drop by, meet some folks, quaff some drinks, eat some cake, and raise a glass to Mr. Darwin. A good time honoring science and reason will be had by all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cambridge Common is just up the street from another Darwin Day activity, this one organized by the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy: a film screening of "The Ledge" starring Liv Tyler, Charlie Hunnam, Terrence Howard, and Patrick Wilson. 6pm, at Harvard Science Center, Hall C. Free and open to the public. Trailer: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvQcOK3ZeQ" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKvQcOK3ZeQ&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Festivitiescontinue the next day with Chapman leading a discussion on the role of science in American politics at the Harvard Humanist Student Center at 12 Eliot St.--across the street from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government-- at 1:30pm on Sunday Feb. 13, as part of a Humanist Sunday Meeting also including yoga, meditation, live music, and potluck brunch.
