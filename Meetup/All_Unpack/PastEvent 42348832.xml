We will gather on Sunday, December 11th at 5pm at the Guild Hall of the Parish Cathedral at 301 Congress Street in downtown Portland. We hope that you will come, and will invite friends and family who would like to connect to others who practice in the Buddhist tradition. Those new to practice or those that are interested in learning more about practice are warmly welcome, and encouraged to attend. Please bring a meditation cushion and pad, and a vegetarian dish to share. Free off-street parking is available in the Cathedral parking lot. The entrance is off of Congress Street.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323644930000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322245393000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Meditation Practice and Potluck</name><id>42348832</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323640800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/42348832/</event_url></item>
