So let's get in some practice before Saturday's 9 holes and meet up at the golf range to hit some balls. This time let's try Starland in Hanover.  They tell me there's cover so if it rains we won't have to reschedule.  If anyone needs to borrow clubs, the range can provide them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimum of 4 Participants (Non-organizers) by noon on Thursday, September 17th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizers: Susan (AO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadlines: The Final Deadline is Noon on Thursday, September 17th. Please be mindful if you change your RSVP to NO at the last minute that you may be taking a spot away from someone else that is serious about participating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to arrive about 5-10 minutes early to get everyone situated. No Guests for this meet-up as demand is high and space is limited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SSFMG and its organizers are not responsible for any injuries to participants or damage to equipment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather Alternative: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None. This event will be canceled if it is raining or too foggy. We will do our best to cancel and notify everyone at least 3 hours prior to the event. Please do not change your RSVP based on weather forecasts. We'll check the weather forecast that morning and determine if the event should be canceled. Please check your email (or the Event Page) Thursday to determine event status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpool: There is no carpool for this event. Members should meet at the Fore Season Driving Range.
