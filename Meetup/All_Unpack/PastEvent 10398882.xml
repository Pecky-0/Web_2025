We will be meeting at East Rock Park (by the ranger station at Orange St. and Cold Spring St.) to play.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No set plan as to what we'll be doing as of yet, all depends on who shows up and what people have to bring with them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there with a portable badminton/volleyball net, bocce ball set and a frisbee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring all your sports-related accessories if you have any, plus any extras for those people who might not and we'll just go from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Jeanie (860) 942-4708&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242659358000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242178327000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cocks of Fury</name><id>10398882</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242486000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/10398882/</event_url></item>
