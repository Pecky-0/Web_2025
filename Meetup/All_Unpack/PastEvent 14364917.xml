Why has history been kinder to Quevedo than to Góngora? How do their respective writings represent very old breeds of impulse that we’re still struggling with? What made Machado return to the fields of Castilla? What did Lorca, Neruda and other poets of the Spanish language learn from Whitman? What makes Neruda so universal and yet innovative? How and why has Borges haunted so many who have come after him? To what degree is the “magical realism” of García Márquez, inaugurated by Alejo Carpentier, actually magical at all? What is most strange, mystical, and/or Mexican about Octavio Paz? Or rather, what is most Pazian about Mexico?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend the format of these seminars to be informative but informal; part lecture, and part discussion where digressions are welcome. We may even laugh quite a bit. At these seminars, you ought to feel among equals or else with some who are just a few steps ahead, beckoning you forward. ¡Que nos veamos pronto!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Healy</member_name><member_id>7634517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281482073000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281362168000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fifth session of: Intro. to Spanish and Latin American Lit: García Márquez &amp; Paz</name><id>14364917</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281477600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/14364917/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/4/4/global_8983348.jpeg</photo_url></item>
