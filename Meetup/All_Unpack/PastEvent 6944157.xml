We will give address/direction information to those coming (not going to post for all to see). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So THANK YOU Monica for your generous offer to this group again.  Lets all help out and let Monica know what you can bring.  In trying to come up with a theme for the party we suggested since the Patriots are once again headed to the Superbowl that we would have a Patriots Superbowl Kickoff theme.  So feel free to where your Patriots gear (or your cheerleading outfits &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;) and bring along some food/drink and enjoy the company and conversation of other divorc(ed)(ing) people.  And yes Giants fans are welcome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post a comment on the event with what you can bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We still need people to sign up to bring items: (suggestions)&lt;br /&gt;Bottled Water&lt;br /&gt;Soft Drinks&lt;br /&gt;Appetizer&lt;br /&gt;Desserts&lt;br /&gt;Salad &lt;br /&gt;Fruit/vegetable platter&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The address will be sent to all members that reply yes.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198159945000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Natick Social Event </name><id>6944157</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201737600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6944157/</event_url></item>
