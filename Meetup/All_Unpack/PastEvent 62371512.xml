 &lt;br /&gt;

 For those who've never been, Science by the Pint is an event sponsored by an organization of Harvard graduate students called Science in the News.  In between their hours of hard work at the mother of all universities (well, in the good ol' US of A at least), they bring their cutting edge scientific research to the public in a fun and informal format.  The event goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main speaker gives a &lt;strong&gt;short&lt;/strong&gt; 5-10 minute talk about their research, then answers general questions (which they couldn't do last time because of the exceptionally large crowd, but fully plan to this time, because the questions are the best part)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team of colleagues comes around to individual tables and spends one-on-one time answering questions over food and refreshments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A drawing is held for prizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Things officially start at 7:00, but we like to start the meetup at 6:30 to allow fellow nerds to find a place to sit together, order food and drinks, and be ready once things get going.  Doreen and I will have our nerdy Meetup pins, so look for us. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 As we mentioned after last month's event, both SITN and Tavern in the Square are aware of the potential popularity of this event, and arrangements are under consideration to give us better space accommodations.  But for now, &lt;strong&gt;there'll be a limit of 25 RSVPs&lt;/strong&gt;.  Please keep your RSVPs updated if you change your plans, so folks on the waiting list who want to attend can have a spot.  Also, the more accurate of attendance info we can give in advance to Tavern in the Square, the more cooperative they'll be in giving us the space we need. If there are throngs on the waiting list beating the doors down, we'll certainly let them know that. We'll be sending out a couple of RSVP reminders. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Tavern in the Square is located on Mass Ave, just a short walk from the Porter Square Red Line stop.  But for those who prefer to drive, there is parking along the left side and in back of the building.  Also you can park on Mass Ave, if you can find a spot. The meters stop collecting quarters at 6:00. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 And of course, if you park in the Porter Square Shopping Center lot by Shaw's, Tags, etc., you will most likely be towed. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Hope to see you there :)&lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
