We will be meeting again at the Enon Village community room in Wenham, so there is plenty of space for trading and parking. Time: 2-4 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic idea is to trade your extra stuff for other peoples extra stuff. Think fresh or preserved foods, handmade items, garden implements, seeds, plants, eggs, tools, composting worms....etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general rules: &lt;br /&gt;Meet and greet at 2:00 &lt;br /&gt;Trading starts at 2:30 &lt;br /&gt;No cash exchanged but you may gift things to someone &lt;br /&gt;Preserved foods should have a label with ingredients &lt;br /&gt;Items that you have not swapped or gifted go home with you for the next time &lt;br /&gt;Wrap up at 4:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And please post a hint of your offerings and anything you're seeking in the comments section!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Iris Weaver</member_name><member_id>8857212</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294710189000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292289108000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North of Boston Monthly Trading Event--January</name><id>15726130</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294599600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/15726130/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/4/global_20248148.jpeg</photo_url></item>
