I know most people work during the week but since Beau and I are going to go regardless of the turnout for the meetup I figured why not invite others in case they are free! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the &amp;quot;trail(s)&amp;quot; are not lengthy but a nice, short, jaunt around the tiny island where dogs can go swimming in the ocean. Beautiful views and awesome breezy sea air. As we discovered, muddy shores may be trekked better with water shoes or some kind of washable sandals. I just rinsed off in the water after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join Beau and I as we take in the gorgeous Portsmouth area from Peirce Island. If anyone's game after we can hit Redhook Brewery and grab a late lunch at the outside tables with the dogs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the water! Drive onto Peirce Island, past the swimming pool and park in the dirt lot on the right. Dogs usually swim on the left, across from the lot.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274832657000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274528539000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Peirce Island - Portsmouth</name><id>13560316</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274796000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/13560316/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/e/global_15129342.jpeg</photo_url></item>
