&lt;p&gt;We'll post the specific topic approximately a week in advance each month so if you have your own equipment you'll know which to bring along if you want more information on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this monthly meeting is built for those who want to investigate (or already are), everyone else, from the curious to the skeptical, are also very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>How to find us: from I-95, take exit 3 to Route 33 West The Center is located 2.6 miles on the right at the corner of 33 and Bayside</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328975487000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328113564000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Investigating Paranormal Topics</name><id>qsdqgcyqdbnb</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328918400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/50562372/</event_url></item>
