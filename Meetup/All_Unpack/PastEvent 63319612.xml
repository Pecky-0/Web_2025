Just updating this meetup, the weather is supposed to be nice, so this meetup is ON! This ride is about 16 miles round trip, a nice ride with no killer hills, just right for an enjoyable ride for all levels of riders, I also plan to ride to Pt. Judith Lighthouse which is about 6 miles  on a road with cars, don't have to ride there if you don't want to, you can just do the bike path, just enjoy yourself. I would like to get a bite to eat after or during the ride, also I plan on leaving at 10AM Sharp! Please get there 15 minutes early if you have to fiddle with your bike and whatnot, I Hope to see you all Sunday for a nice enjoyable ride!
