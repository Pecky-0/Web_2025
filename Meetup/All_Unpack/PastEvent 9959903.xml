The event, which will include a Q&amp;amp;A with the filmmakers, is being presented in partnership with &lt;a href="http://LowellFilmCollaborative.org" target="_blank"&gt;The Lowell Film Collaborative (LFC)&lt;/a&gt; and Christ Church United, UCC, Lowell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the protests outside the Massachusetts State House to the churches of the Reverends Rich Wiesenbach and Carlton Smith, to the historic chambers echoing State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein’s perspective, “The Gay Marriage Thing” captures how all of these voices swirl around the film’s central subjects, Lorre and Gayle, as May 17, 2004, approaches, the first date same-sex couples could file for marriage licenses in Massachusetts. While eavesdropping on the emotional and spiritual toll this issue has taken upon all parties, the story carries forth to the everyday angst and anticipation of Lorre and Gayle’s own wedding.
