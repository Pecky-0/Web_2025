<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A few weeks ago at &amp;quot;Science By the Pint&amp;quot; we ran into Florian Engert who agreed for Nerd Fun to tour his lab... and he had room for seven or eight people. That's it, unfortunately. I manually added the people who came to the previous event to this tour. If you can't come, could you RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... He mentioned we probably won't see any experiments in action, but he is more than welcome to show us around. I still need to find out exactly where it is at Harvard University. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Florian Engert’s Zebra Fish School :&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harvard University, Molecular and Cellular Biology, News and Events&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Engert2.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://golgi.harvard....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Tadpoles don’t behave, but zebra fish do, and that’s why newly promoted Associate Professor Florian Engert is switching the focus of his neuroscience experiments to fish. In the &amp;quot;wild,&amp;quot; the small, silvery zebra fish avoid large, dark looming objects that might be predators and they hunt tiny moving objects that might be food. They can also learn to avoid completely neutral visual cues, such as a geometrical pattern on the bottom of their tank, should Engert surprise them with a mild electric shock when they swim over it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The point of this fish obedience school is to link behavior to learning, and learning to synaptic plasticity, which refers to the changes in the structural connections among neurons. It’s generally believed that strengthening those connections is the underlying basis of learning and memory, and that a &amp;quot;lesson&amp;quot;—whether associating a shock with the color red or learning the ABCs—causes the neurons to fire in such a way that strengthens synapses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Researchers study the synaptic strength by measuring the electrical impulses that one neuron receives when another one is stimulated. Typically, they use microelectrodes inserted directly into neurons to record those impulses. But inserting the electrodes inside the neuron is technically difficult in intact and awake animals. And stimuli delivered through these electrodes do not necessarily simulate the physiologically relevant neuronal activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Just as the big push in neuroscience is to study the human brain noninvasively with fMRI brain scans, Engert also wants to spare his fish the invasive electrode in the brain. To that end, he has developed light-based technologies that he credits to his early background in physics as an undergraduate at the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'The big questions in modern biology can often be narrowed down to the underlying principles of physics,' Engert explains. 'In many cases, we’re no longer going out into the field to observe organisms. We’re creating concise models of the systems we want to understand, and we probe these models with specifically designed experiments. That requires the quantitative and modeling skills of physics.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] Engert began applying the principles and skill of physics while investigating the role of synaptic plasticity in memory during his PhD studies with Tobias Bonhoeffer at the Max Plank Institute in Munich. Using 1/2-millimeter-thick slices of the rat’s hippocampus, the brain region where new memories form, he used electrodes to measure the connections between two individual neurons. 'We could record from one and stimulate another, and then do experiments to study the changes in their synaptic strength,' he recalls. &amp;quot; [ &lt;b&gt;A LOT MORE:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/News/Engert2.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://golgi.harvard....&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Dr. Florian Engert's BioLab:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/fac/engert.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hms.harvar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Our lab's interest lies in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity with respect to its relevance for learning and memory as well as the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;On order to bridge the gap from changes in cellular connectivity to behavioral consequences, and furthermore, to get a better grip on the molecular mechanisms involved, we decided to shift our attention from brain slices in rat to the zebrafish. The obvious advantage being that this is one of the most promising models for forward genetic screens, thus connecting mutations on the molecular level with behavioral or morphological defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The aim of our work will be to use patch-clamp recordings and 2-photon imaging in in vivo preparations of tadpole and zebrafish as model systems to examine the development and activity dependent plasticity of retinotectal connections&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You have to go to the Engert Lab Website:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mcb.harvard.edu/Engert/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mcb.harvar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look on the picture on the first page.

To that end, we have established and quantified a series of visually induced behaviors and analyzed the individual resulting motor components. Using these assays in combination with various calcium indicators and two-photon microscopy we have monitored neuronal activity throughout the fish brain in an awake and intact preparation. An extended goal is the study of how changes or variations in the behavior are reflected in changes in the underlying neuronal activity. To that end, we have developed several quantitative learning assays and tools for in vivo monitoring of neural activity in freely swimming larvae&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
