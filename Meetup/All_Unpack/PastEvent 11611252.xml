It needs to look pretty for Saturday's Wings and Wheels show and Young Eagles the following weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, using Mother Nature's blow dryer, off to Jaffrey for a quick Lobstah Roll... Fly back, finish getting it cleaned... And maybe even coat her with some wax...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a great day coming up for flying and cleaning... Already clean? Come fly anyhow. Wheels off the ground around 5:30! We could go to Barnes instead if we want. AFN wants us gone by 6:30ish. We can decide Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Plane? No Problem. Come down and help. I'm sure I can take someone with me to AFN. Anyone not flown before with me and dare too? I'd love to scare...er....ahm..... have you along...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255787137000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255385049000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Plane Wash and Dry and Lobtsah Rolls, or...</name><id>11611252</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255552200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/11611252/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/b/global_11198203.jpeg</photo_url></item>
