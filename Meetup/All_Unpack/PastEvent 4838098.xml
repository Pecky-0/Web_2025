The first 30 minutes to an hour are normally used for club business, but after that's over, we break out the PHB and modules for a dungeon crawl! Last year, we were adventuring in Rappan Athuk, the Dungeon of Graves. This year, an Eberron story-based campaign is planned. Bring a 5th-level character, special rules can be found at the web URL included, or by emailing mabmoro@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of college rules and regulations, only current CCRI students with a valid ID or schedule can join the club. Non or former CCRI students cannot join the club, but can still play with a $1 per session payment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is normally found in the student lot, to the left of the main building. There is a guest parking area, but it's limited to 30 minutes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payments are taken at the door, or can be paid via paypal to ccrirpg@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is on the first floor, in room 1128. A map of the campus can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.ccri.edu/floorplans/warwick/01.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ccri.edu/f...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1137860670000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CCRI Roleplayer's Guild Weekly Meeting and DnD Game</name><id>4838098</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1138726800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/4838098/</event_url></item>
