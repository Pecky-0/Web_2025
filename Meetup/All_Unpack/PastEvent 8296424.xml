Let's hope for some good weather this time around :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wallum Pond is located in Douglas, MA and the pond itself bisects both MA and RI.  This pond is a first for me, but Chris recommends it, so giving it a try Sunday.  The launch is located off of Wallum Lake Road, we will meet for 2pm and launch shortly thereafter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For details on the pond, please read the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/habitat/maps/ponds/pdf/dfwwallu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the following web site, &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;there is a fee to park your vehicle. I called and was told the fee is $5 per vehicle. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massvacation.com/find/detail.php?org_id=6669" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massvacati...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Directions:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(From Worcester) I-395 South to Exit 2 (Rt 16).
