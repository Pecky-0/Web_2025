The Demography of Unbelief&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;presented by Tom Flynn&lt;br /&gt;Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism and&lt;br /&gt;Editor of Free Inquiry magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've seen the various religion polls and the reported percentages of unbelievers – and the polls vary widely.  How do you know which polls are more reliable?  Join Tom Flynn as he explores how sociologists and pollsters measure religious belief and unbelief.  He will also cover the controversies and scandals in the polling field, and what the polling data on religion really mean (for example, how many of those &amp;quot;no religious preference&amp;quot; people are really atheists?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Flynn is Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism and the Editor of Free Inquiry magazine.  A journalist, novelist, entertainer, and folklorist, Flynn is the author of numerous articles for Free Inquiry, many addressing church-state issues, as well as the best-selling The Trouble With Christmas, about which he has made hundreds of radio and TV appearances in his role as the curmudgeonly “anti-Claus.”  He is also the author of the critically acclaimed anti-religious black comedy science fiction novels, Galactic Rapture and Nothing Sacred.  His latest work, The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief, is a comprehensive reference work on the history, beliefs, and thinking of America’s fastest growing minority: those who live without religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program is scheduled to start at 7 at the UU Church of Worcester, with doors opening at 6:30 for socializing and conversation.
