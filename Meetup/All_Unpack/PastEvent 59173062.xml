Head out to Wheaton College, Thursday, April 5, for a talk by Oscar-winning director/screenwriter Alexander Payne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening gets under way at 7 p.m. with a screening of "Sideways," a quirky tale of two friends on a trip through California's wine country that starred Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen. The movie earned Payne an Oscar for screenwriting and a nomination as best director. He also was nominated this year for directing George Clooney's "The Descendants" and won for its screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The program is free and open to the public at the Weber Theater, Watson Fine Arts Center, Wheaton College, 26 East Main St., Norton, Mass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Posted as an FYI - please RSVP if you're going so others can see who you are and look for you!
