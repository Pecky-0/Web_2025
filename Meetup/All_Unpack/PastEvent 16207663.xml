I have been wanting to check out the seedling cafe in Nashua, maybe we could plan a day and time to meet there for those who are interested?  We could get some yummy vegan food and talk about collective issues around animal rights.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303579208000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252701039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meena's meetup</name><id>16207663</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303574400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/16207663/</event_url></item>
