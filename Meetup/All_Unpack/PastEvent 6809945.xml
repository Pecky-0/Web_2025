This should be a relaxed and fun opportunity to meet up and chat, maybe get a drink or something to eat, so stop by and bring your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no agenda, so we'll just chat about whatever comes to mind, but we are organizing events for the near future (including a forum on worker-member relations at co-operative stores and a fundraising party/concert) and we should check in on progress organizing them.  We also have our presidential campaign well under way, and will give updates about recent developments and upcoming &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome, nothing is required.
