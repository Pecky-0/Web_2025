I also have witnessed how effective treatments that are available can make a HUGE difference; that's why ongoing critical research is needed.  I have contacted the OCD Foundation &lt;a href="http://www.ocfoundation.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ocfoundati...&lt;/a&gt; to obtain their support with advertising this event to make this the 1st annual OCD bike ride in Boston ever!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All pledges you obtain will go directly to the OCF to continue the critical ongoing research needed to help treat this condition.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is a link that you can provide to anyone who wants to make a pledge.  Please have them state in the comments section that the donation is for the OCF Bike Fundraiser.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.givedirect.org/give/givefrm.asp?Action=GC&amp;amp;CID=700" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.givedirec...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to run this event every year as the organizer and founder for this very important cause! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please ride with me and join us for a fun day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year there will only be one ride with a length of about 26 miles.  This is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; a race but a ride so no one has to finish the ride if it is too long for them.  Any part that you can complete is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no minimum to raise unlike some other fundraisers.  Any amount raised will be appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to help as a volunteer, please contact me by e-mail at robfox@verizon.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain Date will be Sunday September 14th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Fox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Please Note: Be sure to bring plenty of water and energy snacks. While we have permission to park at the Concord Middle School, we unfortunately won't have access to bathroom facilities etc....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the sign with the big 300.3 with an X throught it!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rob Fox</member_name><member_id>4368625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>23</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222000183000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211850854000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>1st Annual Bike Ride and Fundraiser for (OCD) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</name><id>8015940</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220796000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/8015940/</event_url></item>
