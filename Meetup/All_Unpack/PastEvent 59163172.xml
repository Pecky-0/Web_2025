&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Monday Night Meetup series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurants and events in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Olympic Records &amp;amp; Round the Corner!!!! READ MORE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in a twist on the regular MNM, this week we're mixing it up a bit. Not to fear, its all in the same area and within easy walking distance! Meet us at one, both or the other, but here's the skinny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:30pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Bring some quarters and meet at Olympic Records and play pinball, carouse and socialize. Olympic records has 3 vintage pinball machines, each with multiple player option up to 4, allowing up to 12 players at any given time. If you are a vinyl record elitist then this place is one for you to know about and Kevin the owner is always interested to see what you've got, so dust off your vinyl, and bring it in for Kevin to look at if you're interested in selling any of your old vinyl treasures! Of course, there is a great stock of used vinyl to purchase as well. (Both 33 1/3 RPM and 45 RPM for those of you who remember what that means.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:00pm&lt;/strong&gt; - Move up the block and over to &lt;strong&gt;12 Governor Street  Providence, RI 02906 to the Round the Corner Bar&lt;/strong&gt; - "Round the Corner" sums it up nicely as it really is set a little way back off Governor Street, just look for the sign in the picture above! Inside its a large, real "neighborhood" bar. The bar is stocked, and offers VERY reasonable higher-end drinks on the order of the Captain S'weeds. Tiger and his bartenders will be serving it all with free dogs and special $2 drafts just for us!!!! (ATM available, &lt;strong&gt;cash bar only&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for an MNM twist and some fun, let's check it out!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels the Monday Night Meetup. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
