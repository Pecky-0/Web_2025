We will be tasting and exploring all things chocolate - tortes, brownies, high percentage cacao bars, chocolate infused dessert wines, chocolate liquers...you name anything chocolate and it'll be here.  This will be a tasting to remember - romantic, fun, indulgent.  Bring your sweet tooth and an open mind.  We'll be pairing different items and learning about the culture of chocolate, its health benefits, and different ways chocolate is used.  And surely a lively discussion will ensue...bring chocolate secrets, recipes, or anything else you'd like to share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday Evans of Empire Tortes will be here to educate on chocolate production, the unique origins of chocolate she uses in her product, as well as how to taste and assess chocolate like a pro!  You'll be amazed by the nuances you'll begin to recognize, much like wine!  Sure to be a challenge for the tastebuds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Rob Muller of Boston Wine Company will be talking about the production and history behind their featured dessert wines, the Deco Port and Ordonez Moscatel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab your gals, girlfriends, guys, or any chocoholic you know and get ready for a night of decadence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featured items: Desree Chocolate Infused Dessert Wine, Deco Port, Godiva liqueur, braquetto, Bottega Gianduia, Banyuls, Bonny Doon Framboise, Jorge Ordonez &amp;amp; Co Seleccion Especial Moscatel, Ghirardelli, Lake Champlain, Empire Tortes, Yummy Mummy brownies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gordonswine.com" target="_blank"&gt;Link to Gordon's website &lt;/a&gt;  Click on &amp;quot;Fine Wine &amp;amp; Culinary Center&amp;quot;, then &amp;quot;Class &amp;amp; Events Calendar&amp;quot;.
