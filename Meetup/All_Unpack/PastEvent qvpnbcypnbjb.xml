&lt;p&gt;Proposed agenda: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Introductions &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Drupal Successes - Review recently launched Drupal sites with a brief explanation of specific highlights of the site. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Drupal Problems - A time for asking about specific Drupal issues that people are having trouble with. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Monthly topic - A more lengthy presentation of a specific topic. Volunteers can post their suggestions? We would also like to encourage folks to post here a list of topics they wish to learn more about. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Tips and Tricks - quick 5 minute talks on helpful tips that people would like to pass along. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Although this is a UMass Drupal User Group that will hopefully encourage an opportunity for creating a Drupal community on campus, we encourage anyone in the extended Drupal community to attend. Many of us hire out projects to local Drupal&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;developers&lt;/span&gt;, so we would love to meet you and get to know your area of expertise. If any of you have an interest in presenting, let us know. We understand that there is a vibrant community with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Western&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Mass&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Drupal User Group, but many of us cannot attend evening meetings in Northampton or Amherst due to the distance we travel and we felt that it was important to establish a Drupal community on campus as more and more people are developing sites using Drupal. &lt;br /&gt;
