Tom reservation.  The trail maps are good and the trails are well marked.  I am sure that there will be group members who are familiar with  place who will be happy to help show us around!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/laughing.gif' border='0' alt='laughing' /&gt;   The Doggin Walkin group suggests we bring a lunch and water for our dogs and make a day of it.  I am a wimp and may not last that long, but I'm probably good for about  about 2 hours.  Any one who  wants to make it a longer outing, that's OK too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;Rules&amp;quot; of Mt. Tom Reservation require that  our canine companions must be on leash, so I will plan accordingly.  We will want to bring water for ourselves and our doggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Holyoke entrance:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the south: Rte. 91 north, take exit #17-A to Rte. 5 north.

Tom boasts an unparalleled view of the Connecticut Valley north and south, the Berkshire mountains to the west and the Pelham hills to the east. This 2,082 acre facility offers 20 miles of hiking and walking trails; picnicking; canoeing and fishing on Lake Bray; and cross country skiing and ice skating in the winter. Mt. Tom also offers a children's play area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today the Reservation includes about 47 of the 80 tree species found naturally in Hampshire County. Mt. Tom is one of the premier hawk watching spots in New England. Each fall, thousands of hawks and other birds fly past the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Holyoke entrance I have a black lab with a blue leash &amp; white PT cruiser</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241126460000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239738300000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt.
