We'll be starting at the pond and going up a hillside to the Hop River Linear Trail (i.e. Rails-To-Trails in Vernon area). Then we'll head up to the cliffs over the park to enjoy the fall colors, good weather, and a picnic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot at 4:30 PM and head out to hike the trail. The hike should take about 1.5 hrs. and we should be done by 6 PM at the latest (just about sunset - no sunset views though). Please bring your own main picnic meal portion and something to share with others. Please include in your RSVP what you're bringing to share (no beer &amp;amp; such allowed in park though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 8.5 miles of blazed trails in the park, as well as a playground, picnic pavilion, toilet facilities and a swimming beach. Portions of the park contain riuns of textile mills and an early trout hatchery and have been declared a national historic site. The park is heavily used for swimming, picnicking, hiking, x-country skiing, fishing, wild flower &amp;amp; wildlife observation and a scenic vista.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;)  is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A park map can be found in the document link.
