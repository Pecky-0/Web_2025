This is the best day for Sally to host this at her cafe. I am on-call the entire weekend and will not be able to be present, but Annie will be helping to coordinate (many thanks, Annie!) I hope you all have a great time and please post about your experience (photos would be nice) afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***IMPORTANT: Since Sally is hosting this she needs an ACCURATE head count. Please, if you do reply Yes, make a commitment to attend. It is, after all, her business, and she will be reserving seats for us, which means that if you don't show up, she is losing business. We should be respectful of her time and her offer to host us. I know that in the past people have replied Yes only to cancel at the very last moment. I hope people will plan their calendars carefully before replying. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>HS Loh</member_name><member_id>9828275</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268683815000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Tea Connoisseurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Tea-Connoisseurs</urlname><id>1479042</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Tea Connoisseurs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267832526000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Tea Leaf</name><id>12796528</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268510400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Tea-Connoisseurs/events/12796528/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/f/global_9325583.jpeg</photo_url></item>
