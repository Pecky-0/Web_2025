I think the group is a great idea and a good concept, but it has not been as successful as I'd hoped.  I am open to all suggestions and ideas that people want to bring forward and will try to implement all that the group feels would benefit us as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought we could meet at the food court, then as a group decide where we want to go to lunch from there.  There are several great restaurants in the mall that we could go to and brainstorm while we get some good eats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing all of you then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update*** I screwed up and have a class on Feb 2nd, so I am changing the date to Feb 9th, same time, same place.  I am sooooo sorry everyone!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be there early in front of the Ben &amp; Jerry's in the food court on the 3rd floor.
