Feel free to respond to me by directly through this event post.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who/What You Should Bring:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring food, guests, etc.  If you do not plan on bringing any food, please bring $6 per person to help me cover costs of snacks I will bring for everyone.  I will also supply Japanese tea as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have posted an image of places we might be in Boston Commons (I will choose the driest and/or least-crowded spot):  &lt;a href="http://Ohanami Picnic Locations" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.culturafranca.com/images/ohanami_locations.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.culturafra...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for us from the bridge near the swan boats, or look for the large Chinese lantern on the edge of the duck pond.  I will also have a couple of signs posted on nearby trees as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Travel:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest station to our location is Arlington Station on the Green Line, but Boylston or Park Street stations are also good options.  If you get off at Boylston or Part Street, please walk through Boston Commons to the Boston Public Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;After Ohanami:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be able to stay for more than a few hours, but if anyone wants to bring a soccer ball, frisbee, etc. we can organize games for the afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will post a couple of large meetup signs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272857884000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271382129000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>UPDATED: ~Cherry Blossom Viewing Picnic (Ohanami)~</name><id>13196678</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272124800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/13196678/</event_url></item>
