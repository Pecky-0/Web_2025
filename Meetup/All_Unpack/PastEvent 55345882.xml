It's taking place at Hynes Convention Center, which is surrounded by roughly 1.4 million eat, and lunch location can be tbd based on how many people are interested! More details about the con are available at &lt;a href="http://www.bostoncomiccon.com"&gt;www.bostoncomiccon.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Due to the number of people RSVPed, I think our best bet is to do the food court at the Prudential mall, which adjoins to the Hynes Convention Center. Meet near the St. Francis Chapel (its next to the Dunkin Donuts) just outside the Pru's Hynes Convention Center entrance at 12:30 and we'll head over for food and comic talk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet near the St Francis Chapel outside of the Hynes Convention Center entrance in the Prudential mall.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lyndsay</member_name><member_id>9909820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335030061000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331129838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Comic Con 2012 - Lunch &amp; Meetup</name><id>55345882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335025800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/55345882/</event_url></item>
