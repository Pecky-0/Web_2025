Meet other busy people, and meetup members near you! A great networking opportunity, as well.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Dances, sporting events, parties, bonfires and outdoor activities, theatre etc. will be posted, sometimes with other Meetups (the more the merrier:). I may even try a Real Estate seminar :) I'm BIG into live bands, esp. rock n' roll, so if you like to "rock on" and dance, you'll love this group.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Any suggestions I'm always open, love to have more organizers, to post events here, so let me know if you're willing to help :)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Hope to meet you soon at a dance or meetup! Susan&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

or if you're looking to buy or sell real estate in the near future, please email me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and live by this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIFE'S MIRROR&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

by M. Bridges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

There are souls that are pure and true,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

THEN GIVE TO THE WORLD THE BEST YOU HAVE,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

AND THE BEST WILL COME BACK TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give love, and love to your life will flow,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

A strength in your utmost need,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Have faith, and a score of hearts will show&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Their faith in your word and deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give truth, and your gift will be paid in kind;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

And honor will honor meet;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

And a smile that is sweet will surely find&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

A smile that is just as sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give pity and sorrow to those who mourn,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

You will gather in flowers again&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

The scattered seeds from your thoughts outborne&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Though the sowing seemed but vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For life is the mirror of king and slave,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

'Tis just what we are and do;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

THEN GIVE TO THE WORLD THE BEST YOU HAVE,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

AND THE BEST WILL COME BACK TO YOU :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.55</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1208693394000</created><lat>42.7299995422</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>491</id><urlkey>dance</urlkey><name>Dance</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3250</id><urlkey>couples</urlkey><name>Couples</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10232</id><urlkey>women</urlkey><name>Women's Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18964</id><urlkey>real-estate</urlkey><name>Real Estate</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>19491</id><urlkey>outdoor-activities</urlkey><name>Outdoor activities</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>74868</id><urlkey>singles-and-couples-welcome</urlkey><name>Singles and Couples welcome</name></topics_item></topics><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
