The following is a Message from Kevin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Greetings friends:
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;I invite you to join me in celebrating the first third of my life. (Or just come have fun on the beach.)
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;ME:&amp;nbsp;I'll get there early and grab a spot. I'll have a couple tables, a little grill and a couple beef patties for the grill and maybe some beef franks. I'll be there until&amp;nbsp;I get sick of being there or they kick&amp;nbsp;us out.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;YOU:
 &lt;br /&gt;BYOE
 &lt;br /&gt;Bring your own EVERYTHING
 &lt;br /&gt;(Enough to share)
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;So...
 &lt;br /&gt;If you want to eat... bring it!
 &lt;br /&gt;If you want to drink... bring it!
 &lt;br /&gt;If you want to sit... bring it!
 &lt;br /&gt;If you want to play... bring it!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;But if you want to give me a gift... LEAVE IT!!!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Seriously...
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This is about all my friends coming together in one place and meeting each other and to marvel at how good I look for my age. ;)
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;So let me know if you're coming. Let me know what you're bringing to share. And let's chill for a minute.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;RAIN DATE: JULY 11, 2012"&lt;/p&gt;
