I hope everyone had a fantastic Turkey Day! I'm shooting for this Sunday (December 11th) at noon. Best Friends (the business that we have our meetups at) is having its anual &lt;strong&gt;Angel Tree Fundraiser&lt;/strong&gt;. They're raising money and&amp;nbsp;collecting food and toys for Baypath Humane Society (for both dogs and cats). If you could &lt;strong&gt;bring somethnig to donate&lt;/strong&gt;, that would be great! (anything is fine -&amp;nbsp;a bag or can of dog or cat food, a toy, money - it all helps! You can even purchase a toy at Best Friends! Meetup members DO get 30% off of retail on the day of the meetup!) If you're able to make this event, Giuseppe, Marcel and I can't wait to see you! If you're unable to make this one, we'll catch you next time! &lt;strong&gt;HAPPY HOLIDAYS!! :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lillian</member_name><member_id>9395119</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329078949000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Metrowest-Small-Dogs-Meetup</urlname><id>1443075</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>Metrowest Small Dogs Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323200424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Small Dogs Holiday Meetup!!</name><id>43599942</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323622800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Metrowest-Small-Dogs-Meetup/events/43599942/</event_url></item>
