&lt;p&gt;There are FOUR other Bowl games that start at 1:00pm so feel free to come a little early for even MORE college football action! Rose Bowl kick off is at 5:10pm.  Come early to get a good seat! Battery Park will be having their "Hangover Brunch" available until 5:00pm including their bloody mary bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is conveniently located in the Financial District in Boston.  It's within walking distance of Blue Line (State and Government Center), Orange Line (State), Green Line (Gov't Center), and a short walk to Red Line (Park Street).  Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there! -Isabel&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in my STANFORD gear!
