Trivia begins at 9:00pm and runs until approx 11:00pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like at Sky Lounge (for Wednesday night trivia, see you on the 10th), this is LIVE bar-trivia, not a computerized game like you see at some places - If you're not coming because you think trivia is too hard, or not 'your thing', think again; There's some challenge, but it's mostly fun! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teams are made up of 6 players (or less) - it's more fun to play with multiple teams so we can compete with each other (hint, hint... please join us). If you think of it, bring along ideas for our team's name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thepeddlersdaughter.com/location.php?l=n" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thepeddler...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth MacKenzie</member_name><member_id>3143060</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267751236000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Gamers</urlname><id>393834</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Greater Nashua Gamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267507233000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesday Pub Trivia Night at Peddlers Daughter</name><id>12753597</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267578000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/events/12753597/</event_url></item>
