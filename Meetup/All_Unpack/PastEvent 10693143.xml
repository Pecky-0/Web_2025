<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Tetro is writer/director Francis Ford Coppola's first original screenplay since 1974's The Conversation. It is his most personal film yet, arising from memories and emotions from his early life, though totally fictional. When Bennie (Alden Ehrenreich) finds his long-estranged brother Tetro (Vincent Gallo) living in Buenos Aires, he discovers that his sibling, once a brilliant writer, is now tormented this stylish black-and-white-and-sometimes-color melodrama, it might gain some notice for suggesting great things to come!

If you like Francis Ford Coppola, or Vincent Gallo (Buffalo 66) , or Rumble Fish, Cinema Paradcio you will defiantly like this. This is LUSH with atmosphere! 
I am frantically searching for what theater is playing this and when! Hey Vincent Gallo .. You are a f***ing genius!
