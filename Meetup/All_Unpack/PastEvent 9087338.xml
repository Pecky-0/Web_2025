We play to have fun, and all are welcome to come. Skill level does not matter. Some people are good some are bad, we realize that everyone has varying levels of game. If you have never played flag-football, it's very easy to pick-up. This is also a great group of people, so if you are interested in meeting other people, this is a nice casual environment for that. If you want to get some exercise, this is also a good opportunity to stretch your legs and run around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you Saturday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226772746000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225751765000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT - 1PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>9087338</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226167200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/9087338/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
