<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Movie:  &amp;quot;Rabbit Proof Fence&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the true story of Molly Craig, a young black Australian girl who leads her younger sister and cousin in an escape from an official government camp, set up as part of an official government policy to train them as domestic workers and integrate them into white society. With grit and determination Molly guides the girls on an epic journey, one step ahead of the authorities, over 1,500 miles of Australia's outback in search of the rabbit-proof fence that bisects the continent and will lead them home. These three girls are part of what is referred to today as the 'Stolen Generations.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us for this movie followed by a lively discussion and refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Center of Light is on the Orange Line - Stonybrook T-stop</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217201884000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213640934000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Night:  "Rabbit Proof Fence"</name><id>8153204</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217028600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/8153204/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/2/global_4477970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
