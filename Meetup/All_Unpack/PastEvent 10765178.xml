We'll launch at the state boat ramp at Quaboag Pond, paddle across the pond and into the river.  We'll go up the river a ways to the take-out at Rt. 148 and get out and stretch and have a snack, then turn around and paddle back to the launch, about 3 hours of paddling in total (if anyone wants to leave at 148, we can sort out moving cars when we get there).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions - Depends on where you are coming from, but if you mapquest Quaboag St. in Brookfield, you'll see where the road goes along the east side of the pond, this is where the state boat launch is, you can find your best way there...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251152214000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246322634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quaboag River - Brookfield, MA</name><id>10765178</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249218000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/10765178/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
