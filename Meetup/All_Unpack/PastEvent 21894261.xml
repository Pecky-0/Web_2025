stay in condition for the more strenuous events. Since I live on
the Connecticut River, my afternoon hikes will be scheduled in the
Sunapee/Upper Valley/Dartmouth region. Frequent Hikes that can be
done after work on nice days. Take out a nibble of the Appalachian
Trail or a local peak, unwind with a hike and burn a few C's. This
event will be too far from many, so hopefully this will give you an
idea to post your own ideas for your local area and help you find a
hiking partner. We will decide on what day is best and email each
other and set up text communications in case the Boss wont let you
leave yet. Sometimes it just takes a nudge to get us out of the
house- have the day pack ready and have a nice time, Our first hike
is already scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308261511000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307885314000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Afternoon Short Hike</name><id>21894261</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308168000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/21894261/</event_url></item>
