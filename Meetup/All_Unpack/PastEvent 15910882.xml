For those who would like to go snowshoeing or cross country skiing that is also a possibility. I have about three extra pairs of snow shoes if anyone would like to try them I will bring them.  See you there.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an extra sled or tobogan to share that would be nice! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info on Wagon Hill:    &lt;br /&gt;Wagon Hill was created by the town of Durham to save an early Seacoast farm from development. The 130-acre farm includes grassy meadow trails and orchard areas and still has the look and feel of a classic New England farm. Wagon Hill is identified by the old wooden wagon at the top of the hill along Route 4, one of the most photographed spots in the region. Great easy hikes, panoramic view, free parking and winter sledding.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: From Durham on Route 4 (heading east to Portsmouth) turn right at the sign across from Emory Farm.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for my long toboggan, and I'll be having a blue coat on.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297120399000</updated><rating><average>3.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294145799000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sledding / Tobogganing Day at Wagon Hill</name><id>15910882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296925200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15910882/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/6/global_2913654.jpeg</photo_url></item>
