Names however can be deceiving especially when they have an underlying agenda. Atkinson Republican Committee invites all who value their property rights to attend an informational talk on Sustainable Development. This is not a Republican or Democrat specific issue, it is an insidious program designed to erode private property. It is not right or left; it is just plain wrong. To our knowledge Atkinson has signed onto this program without voter or resident input. &lt;br /&gt;

Ken Eyring and Eileen Mashimo, both from Windham, have done extensive research on this topic. They will join us on August 28 at the Kimball Library to share facts about this program as well as educate us as to how this program impacts residents if implemented. If you value your personal property, something you worked hard for, the American Dream, than this is information that you will not want to miss. &lt;br /&gt;

In addition Dennis Lamare candidate for Congress CD2 will be on hand to meet residents, as will local Candidates for State Representative. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
