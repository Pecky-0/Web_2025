SOME OF YOU WILL GET WET&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring some POT LUCK food..and your favourite beverages for the group Barbie-q after.&lt;br /&gt;Bring what you really like and some more. We might like it and will eat it even if its a doubble with someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Group Pot Luck barbie-q is the second half to a  PERFECT outing also right by the river after the paddle...(if you didnt get a chance to paddle with us this is also open to people interested in meeting us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Bring chairs..and whatever else you like to sit around on.&lt;br /&gt;The grill is loaded and ready, BRING SOME SCRAP WOOD TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Kayaks available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Paddle &amp;amp; Paddle Leash, Life Jacket with whistle is included with any of my yaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doughnation of  $ 20.00,  bucks for my kayaks reserved for this particular event.&lt;br /&gt;Its way less than what sport shops charge and the yaks &amp;amp; Paddles are top quality delivered and picked up at the site etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you are familiar with the yak you choose and can fit in them since i don't have any &amp;quot;Wide Butt&amp;quot; (greater than 17&amp;quot;~18&amp;quot; butts) yaks anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Don't laugh, its serious, some will not fit in a yak thats too small (ie the Greenlander Pro) of an opening and i will feel sad you cant go..etc..the other option is to maybe trade with someone..etc ..if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;This has worked in the past very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will only bring the yaks that are confirmed by a yes and by persons i have some familiarity with ?..(ie paddle skills matched to the boat, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybee's obviously can't reserve any yaks &amp;amp; if ya reserve one and don't show up, ya won't ever get a second chance to again unless its some real good excuse..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry i don't like to leave un-attended yaks on the trailer. They get stolen too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF USING MY YAKS YOU CANT LOOK LIKE A BONEHEADED BEGINNER AND STEP INTO THEM VIA THE FLOOR (yes the lightest kayaks have thin fiberglass and your feet will go through them) OR DRIVE UP ON SHORE WITH THEM LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO A DRIVE IN MOVIE. ( In an 18 foot long boat you will still be 10 or so feet out in the water at a greater depth.) Only Novices in short wide cheap plastic boats do that kind of thing.  :-)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INFO ON THE FOLLOWING LINK: I will also show you the correct way and you will look like a intelligent seasoned pro and impress the others who don't know how.
