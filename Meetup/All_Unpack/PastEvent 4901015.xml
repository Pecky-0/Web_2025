We'll be able to have a more private setting there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring drinks or food for yourselves as this space doesn't have a resturant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having the Olympus Reps in to speak to us about their new cameras. We may have a member from the Boston meetup group there to give us a HBDI survery. The HBDI is the Herrman Brain Dominance Instrument. It's designed to find out how our brain &amp;quot;sees&amp;quot; things. This is purely up to you if you'd like to participate it's not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring any new work you'd like to share and discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1147697557000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1144974619000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography May Meetup</name><id>4901015</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1147390200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/4901015/</event_url></item>
