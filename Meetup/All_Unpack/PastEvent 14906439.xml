I haven't been to the IMAX in the Boston Common theater yet, so this will be interesting to check out. The tickets are more money though - sorry about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original Post&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ferrell voices Megamind, an incompetent supervillian who accidentally kills his superhero nemesis, Metro Man, and then has to take his place and defend megacity or whatever. Also features the voices of Tina Fey and Jonah Hill, who have been in some of my favorite films in the last couple of years. Plus Jonah has the best last name ever. The movie sounds similar to Despicable Me, but I thought that was a hoot, so, count me in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will wear my red meetup hat. Since I've never been to the IMAX theater before, I'm not sure where to wait. I will say that unless I edit this meetup, I'll be waiting by the tables by the big window in the second floor lobby. I'll be at the theater at 6:30, and we should go in and get seats at 7:10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Megamind&amp;quot; is the most brilliant super–villain the world has ever known... and the least successful. Over the years, he has tried to conquer Metro City in every imaginable way – Each attempt, a colossal failure thanks to the caped superhero known as &amp;quot;Metro Man,&amp;quot; until the day Megamind actually defeats him in the throes of one of his botched evil plans. Suddenly, the fate of Metro City is threatened when a new villain arrives and chaos runs rampant, leaving everyone to wonder: Can the world's biggest &amp;quot;mind&amp;quot; actually be the one to save the day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailer&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu42-p6_5RE&amp;amp;feature=channel" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frederick Hill</member_name><member_id>4478749</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293825708000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285556401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Megamind</name><id>14906439</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288998000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/14906439/</event_url></item>
