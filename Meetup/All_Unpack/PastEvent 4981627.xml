Do you want to know more about Plone, Zope, and Python?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and meet other Plone users and developers at the Boston Plone users group. We will gather monthly to talk about how we are using Plone, share knowledge and give demonstrations of cool Plone products. All skill levels are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proposed topics for this meeting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;quot;What's new in Plone 2.5&amp;quot; - &lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/whatsnew/2.5/" target="_blank"&gt;http://plone.org/docu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;quot;Building the bostonplone.org site&amp;quot; - a discussion of features and functionality that we would like to include on the bostonplone.org site. a review of the skin that was created by Rob Baker at the April meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;quot;Plone for Newcomers&amp;quot; introduction to help people get familiar with Plone more quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;quot;Lightning Talks&amp;quot; - 5 minute introductions to topics spanning the landscape of Plone.  Launched a new site?  Looking to hire?  Tried a new product lately?  We want to hear about it.  Additionally, if you're looking for insight on a topic, you can request a lightning talk of others.  Come prepared to share and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have specific topics that you'd like to discuss, please post them in the discussion forum. (and yes, we will eventually move this over to a Plone site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.bostonplone.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonplone.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonplon...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1150416392000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone July Meetup</name><id>4981627</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1153436400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/4981627/</event_url></item>
