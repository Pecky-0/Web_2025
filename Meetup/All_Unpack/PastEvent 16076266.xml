&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.au.org/about/authors/rob-boston-photo.jpg" style="margin : 5px ; max-width : 700px ; max-height : 700px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.au.org/author/boston/"&gt;Rob Boston&lt;/a&gt;, senior policy analyst with &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt;, will visit our group from Washington, DC, to speak on the topic of "Church-State Separation:  Where We Stand Now." &amp;nbsp;He will bring us up-to-date on the most recent judicial and legislative developments, and other happenings in the area of church-state separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob is a highly respected church-state expert, author of several books on the topic, including "&lt;a&gt;Close Encounters with the Religious Right&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a&gt;Why the Religious Right is Wrong about Separation of Church &amp;amp; State&lt;/a&gt;." &amp;nbsp;He also sits on the board of directors of the American Humanist Association.  Rob has appeared on national television and spoken on the issue of church-state separation around the country.  Separation of church and state is an important topic nowadays, always controversial and sure to draw the attention of both sides in the so-called "culture wars." &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to show up at the church around 6:30pm if you would like to socialize. The formal meeting will start at 7:00pm. The meeting is free and open to the public, but we always welcome donations at the door. If you are not already a paying member of GWH, we encourage you to become one. It's only $30 for a one-year membership. Dues help to pay the cost of speakers and other programming, and they allow us to do outreach and other activities. Please show your support for Humanism and GWH. You can pay dues at the GWH web site: www.worcesterhumanists.org or you can see our treasurer, Don Guyton, at the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
