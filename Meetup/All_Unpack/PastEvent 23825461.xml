There will be both a basic and an advanced level class. Both classes are taught in Portuguese by Professor Carmem Nicoli. This is a continuation of the pilot class program that started in May 2011. The Center was so excited by the turnout and interest that we&amp;nbsp;knew that we had to offer it again. The classes will start the week of July 11th.&amp;nbsp;That means &amp;nbsp;July 12th for the basic and July 14th for the advanced. The cost is $180.00 for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic class will be 7-8:30pm on Tuesdays and advanced will be Thursday from 7-8:30pm. There will a full refund after the first class only. Any questions, please feel free to ask! Please send all payments to the Brazilian Immigrant Center and note that the payment is for the Portuguese Basic or Advanced class. Also, if you find that you are in the basic and prefer a challenge or think the advanced is too much of a challenge you can move the other level.&lt;/p&gt;
