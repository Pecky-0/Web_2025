ANY EXPERIENCE LEVEL IS WELCOME!! We always have some who have never played before as well as veterans. &lt;br /&gt;

We will shoot for having a 202 board, but as always we reserve that board for those who have gotten out of the Rat Race at least five times. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We'll be meeting in the lobby of the Marino Rec Center at NU's campus. &amp;nbsp;There are plenty of places nearby to grab something to eat and drink too. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

There is parking on Hemenway Street. Even though it says Fenway Resident, I have never gotten a ticket there. However, if you do, you're on your own. If you have any trouble finding us, please feel free to call my cell (617-519-3163). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

PLEASE BE ON TIME!!! We will start PROMPTLY at noon. &amp;nbsp;We stop the game at 2:45pm to allow for some debrief and discussion afterward. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

BRING YOUR PENCILS AND YOUR CALCULATORS!! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We're looking forward to seeing you ALL there on Sunday February 5!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
