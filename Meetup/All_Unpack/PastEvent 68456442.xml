&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone who wants to spend a day writing without distractions. All experience levels and all types of writing are welcome. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;But space is limited--so if you're interested, sign up now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (you can always change your RSVP later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE'LL DO:&lt;/strong&gt; Think of this as a one-day writing retreat, during which you may work on whatever projects you wish. The space will be available from 11 to 6, but you may arrive and leave whenever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;--&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is this a workshop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--A:&lt;/strong&gt; No. We might start with a few writing prompts, but beyond that, we'll just write, write, write. No one will read what you've written unless you want to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we'll be in the same room, we'll be writing in companionable silence, talking only during breaks and meals. If you'd like to have a lengthy conversation with someone, you're welcome to step outside or wander over to the cute little coffee shop up the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the day, we can either go out to dinner or bring food in (there are numerous options nearby). Then—if people are so inclined—we can share what we've written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Located near the Holliston town center, ArtStudio 360 is air-conditioned and has free parking, plenty of tables and chairs, a restroom and a  kitchenette (fridge, microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, spring water dispenser). I'll provide a laser printer and paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; Yourself, your writing projects and writing implements (computer or  writing notebook and pen). Bring your own beverage. Feel free to bring a snack to share—but that’s entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px ; text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Q:&lt;/strong&gt; May I bring an art journal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px ; text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--A:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure. But please plan to spend your time writing, or otherwise working quietly in your journal, rather than doing anything that might be distracting to other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $10 (cash or check), regardless of how long you stay. This fee helps keep ArtStudio 360 open. If this is a hardship, just let me know and we'll work something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt; Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly so that your space becomes available to someone else. Please do this right up to the start time of the event. Can't make it this time? I scheduled a second one for &lt;span style="color : #3366ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/68456682/"&gt;Sunday, Aug. 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Feel free to RSVP for that one (or both!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; In the unlikely event that we need to cancel due to bad weather or other reasons---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." &lt;em&gt;So please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW POLICY REGARDING RSVPs:&lt;/strong&gt; Your RSVP is a reservation, and we're trusting that you'll honor it. If you can't make it, please change your RSVP from "yes" to "no" before the event start time. If this event is full, we reserve the right to ask people who RSVP "yes" but then don't show up--thus preventing someone else from attending--to pay the $10 fee anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
