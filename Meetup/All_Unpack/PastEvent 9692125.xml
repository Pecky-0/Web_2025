THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF VENUE for tonight's happy our!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our 2nd happy hour @ 6:30PM will now be at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stix Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge&lt;br /&gt;www.stixboston.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;35 Stanhope St (directly across the street from 33)&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02116&lt;br /&gt;(617) 456-7849&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Everyone but 33 is closed until restaurant week. However, Stix will be open!! It is owned by the same management company as 33 and is located directly across the street from our original venue. Sorry about the confusion and last minute change of venue. I spoke to several people at 33 who did not know it would be closed today. Even their web site says it's open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you at Stix at 35 Stanhope (directly across the street from 33)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;PS- Why Wednesday night? Thursday - Saturday nights would be insanely busy and in my opinion not worth dealing with the crowds. Wednesday night should be much more mellow.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike/Meet up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236918746000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233995541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>IMPORTANT: Regarding 2nd Happy Hour - Venue Change: Stix 35 Stanhope  </name><id>9692125</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236209400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9692125/</event_url></item>
