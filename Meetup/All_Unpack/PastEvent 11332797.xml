The hike will be done as a loop by going up Edmands Path and down the Crawford Path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is 8.1 miles in length with 3100 feet of elevation gain with a book time of 5:35.  We plan on hiking &lt;b&gt;faster&lt;/b&gt; than book time with an expected return time of 3:30 PM.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike to the summit of Eisenhower is 3.1 miles, where we will hang from 11:30 to @ 12:15 to see the Stars &amp;amp; Stripes raised by a friend and his family.  &lt;img src="http://forums.flagsonthe48.org/images/smiles/icon_flag.gif" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will then hike the 1.8 miles in @45 minutes over to Mt Pierce to see them flying there thanks to Boy Scout Troop 47. We will depart at 1:30 for the 3.2 mile trip back to the Clinton Road parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the hike you are invited back to our site at the TarryHo campground where we will be hosting a cookout for some of the FOT48 participants as they start returning from their peaks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anybody who would like to camp Friday and/or Sat night, TarryHo is offering &lt;b&gt;GROUP&lt;/b&gt; camping on river sites for $8 per person/night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be in the green suburban with the flag attached to the antenna.
