&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ride:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 minutes north of Woburn, MA is beautiful Lake Massabesic. From the boat launch parking lot we will ride eastward on the Rockingham Recreational trail towards Great Bay. The trail is covered in Gravel, Grass, Dirt, Sand and shaded with trees. &amp;nbsp;The full trail is 26 miles but I think we'll stop around at Epping, NH which is about 17.5 miles in to get some lunch and turn around. At the 10 mile mark we may find a wooded area with a hill and a lake. We may want to climb to the top to take in the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to bring:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must bring a helmet. I highly recommend either a hybrid or a mountain bike. Bring a repair kit, snack, plenty of water, bug spray, sun screen and layers of clothing for warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire's largest city, Manchester, boasts relatively quick access to one of the state's longest rail-trails: the 26-mile Rockingham Recreational Trail (a.k.a. Portsmouth Branch). The rustic trail is rich in railroad structures, left over from a time when the extensive Boston &amp;amp; Maine Railroad network flourished with the growth of New England mill towns. The Rockingham Recreational Trail follows the Portsmouth Branch. Hurt by the mid-20th century decline in local manufacturing, the railroad faltered, and in 1988, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation purchased the Portsmouth Branch for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach the Massabesic Lake trailhead from Manchester, take State Route 101 north and east, then take Bypass 28 south. After passing through a rotary, look for the Massabesic Lake boat launch on the left. The trailhead is at the boat launch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In boat ramp parking lot at the northern end near the trail head.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Douglas M.</member_name><member_id>9031252</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319463757000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318741088000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Foliage ride along the Rockingham Recreational Trail starting near Manchester NH</name><id>37543142</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319292000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/37543142/</event_url></item>
