<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Buon Giorno Amici,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I began to looked into Facebook's ability to handle our meetup needs. As we approach our 3rd Anniversary, I have decided to move this group to Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of you are already on facebook so making this move won't be so hard. Type in &amp;quot;Connecticut's Viva Italia Group&amp;quot; into the search area and wala you are there. We will be able to have the same functionality we have now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, on June 23rd this group that I founded back in 2007 will no longer exist here on Meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to have you join me at our new address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorenzo</member_name><member_id>4408109</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277338448000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Amici Italiani</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-452</urlname><id>535327</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276329622000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Group - We're Moving</name><id>13777516</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277334000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-452/events/13777516/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/f/5/global_5243621.jpeg</photo_url></item>
