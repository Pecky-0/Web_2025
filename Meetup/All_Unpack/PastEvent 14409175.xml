Well, that's what we have in store on the evening of Friday September 3rd!  Come on out and join Wedeln at The Green Dragon in Faneuil Hall.  Project DCQ is a Wedeln favorite, a band composed of Berkeley graduates that play everything you can imagine, including your current favorites.  They've played our golf tourney three years in a row and we've seen them around Boston too!  Come join us on Friday 9/3 to kick off the start of your Labor Day Weekend!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be a cover charge around $5. I'll post exact amount once I find out. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>For anyone that I don't know, I'll reach out to them to arrange to meet up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>7362850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283566682000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281668582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TGIF Celebration w/Wedeln and Project DCQ @ The Green Dragon</name><id>14409175</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283562000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/14409175/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/8/global_14726280.jpeg</photo_url></item>
