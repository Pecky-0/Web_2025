 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Vince Longo, General Manager of the South Shore Music Theater, "It's not to often that someone grabs my attention like Brad did. He was hysterical, likable, and most importantly, clean. We can't wait to have him back."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;As a frequent writer for Jay Leno's Tonight Show monologue, Brad has held his own on the comedy circuit with such luminaries as; Lenny Clark, Kevin James, Ray Ramano and the legendary Pat Cooper, who said "Brad is a throwback to the old days. A gifted storyteller who doesn't have to use four letter words to get laughs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
