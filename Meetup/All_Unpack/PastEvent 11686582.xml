What better inside activity than a rousing game of scrabble? :)  I have one deluxe scrabble board, and if the event fills we can play in teams.  Or, if you have a scrabble board, we can have several games going at once.  Feel free to bring a scrabble dictionary if you have one - because I don't!  There is no set agenda for the night, just relaxing and fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a private residence there won't be food/alcohol provided, but feel free to bring your dinner, a snack or any special drinks for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exact address and contact info will be emailed the day before. ;)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257984315000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256227391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scrabble Night </name><id>11686582</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257811200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11686582/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/global_6726124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
