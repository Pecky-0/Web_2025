They have a good beer list too. Come on down. It should be a fun time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying you aren't any good at trivia is no excuse not to come out. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows something about the world and can make a great contribution to the game as well as to the conversations around the tables while we play. Come on out, socialize with the easiest group of people you'll ever make friends with! Did I mention the Ale House has a great beer list?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game starts around 8 and should run for about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will try to snag a large table and have a Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>c</member_name><member_id>2264651</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281323713000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280072933000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ English Cellar Ale House in Providence</name><id>14206488</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281312000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/14206488/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
