Hear Dr Paul speak and cheer your brains out for our hero! BRING ANY FRIENDS OR FAMILY THAT ARE UNDECIDED. This will be the turning point for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Paul will start speaking at 2:30PM, but please come between 1:45PM and 2PM as parking and accessing the MUB can be a long process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the details on the MUB, click here UNH MUB info and hover over &amp;quot;Building Facilities&amp;quot; for a drop down menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT PARKING INFO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven Rogers is the Students for Ron Paul club leader there and he recommends using C-Lot for parking or if that is full, use A-Lot. If you use A-Lot you may want to wait and catch the Wildcat Transit bus for $1.00. The walk is about a mile I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking charge is $1 per hour &lt;br /&gt;There is also metered parking available along the main road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also gave a stern warning not to be tempted to park in the Durham Marketplace plaza parking lot. They are militant about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many long steep staircases at the MUB. I am not sure which entrance to tell you to use...any one of them will get you there...ask questions and find an elevator if you have any trouble with stairs. MUB phone: 862-2600.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Download a campus map here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unh.edu/map/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.unh.edu/ma...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194807884000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194485411000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul Speaking Event at UNH</name><id>6698634</id><headcount>275</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194634800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6698634/</event_url></item>
