So we'll break into two groups, one will go the cafe on Huntington Ave  we usually go to after MFA films while the others will stay for the reception and party. Probably best to order tickets for the reception ahead of time- here is the link: &lt;a href="https://ev12.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=08%3AMFA%3AFL0929-7%3AFL0929-7%2C14517&amp;amp;linkID=mfab&amp;amp;url=https%3A//ev12.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventList%3FlinkID%3Dmfab" target="_blank"&gt;https://ev12.evenue.n...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the month of September a number of challenging films have been posted as group events and &amp;quot;Leila Khaled: Hijacker&amp;quot;  is yet another. Difficult movies often make for engaged discussions  for the group and so while the subject matter of the film is serious, very often we have  quite an enjoyable time speaking with each other afterward. Then again we kicked off September with a Charlie Chaplin double-feature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leila Khaled: Hijacker is the opening night presentation of the MFA's first Palestinian Film Festival. After the film there will be an opening night party with live music. The cost for this party is an additional $20. More information about the opening night party will be provided below. If you are interested in attending this post-movie party, please indicate so in the comment field when you RSVP. If the response is good, we'll make this a part of the group's meet-up as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here is the MFA's description of the film : &lt;br /&gt;Leila Khaled: Hijacker by Lina Makboul (Sweden, 2005, 58 min.). In 1969, Palestinian Leila Khaled made history by becoming the first woman to hijack an airplane. As a Palestinian child growing up in Sweden, filmmaker Lina Makboul admired Khaled for her bold actions; as an adult, she began asking complex questions about the legacy created by her childhood hero. This fascinating documentary is at once a portrait of Khaled, an exploration of the filmmaker?s own understanding of her Palestinian identity, and a complex examination of the nebulous dichotomy between ?terrorist? and ?freedom fighter.? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussion with the director follows the screening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to a review: &lt;a href="http://libweb.lib.buffalo.edu/emro/emroDetail.asp?Number=2895" target="_blank"&gt;http://libweb.lib.buf...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is more information about the post-film party:  &lt;br /&gt;Join us for the Film Festival opening party after the screening from 8:30?11 pm. Free admission for press at the School of Museum of Fine Arts from 8:30 pm until 12 am. With directors, performance by Palestinian oud and violin virtuoso and composer Simon Shaheen, and live music by Aboud Albert Agha (oud and singer) and Anastassia Zachariadou (kanun, flutes), plus others.
