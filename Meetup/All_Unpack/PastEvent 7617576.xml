It was great to see so many new faces and jolly old members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the meeting, a few folks asked more about the Worcester Photo Centers web site and the Wiki pages Casey brought up. We'd love for things to be interactive with all our members, we'd like to build a place where we can share our thoughts, ideas, shows, and photos. So... We've decide to do a demo of the web site and a demo of how to use the Wiki pages. I can feel your excitement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next meet up will be at the Worcester Public Library. We would like for you to bring your lap tops that have wireless internet capabilites and join in on the demo and add things to the pages. We'll show you how!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We encourage you to feel free to bring a few Jpeg images, or maybe a show announcement, or what ever you'd like to add. Be creative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be starting at **7PM** this time and will do this demo for an hour or so, then mix and mingle, and when they kick us out at 9PM, and they will,  we will go over to Cafe Dolce on Shrewsbury Street for yummy treats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the links to get your juice following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a link on our WPC page via Quicklinks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.worcesterphotographycenter.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.worcesterp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...or...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://worcesterphotographycenter.org/2col/QuickLinks.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://worcesterphoto...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...or, you can get there directly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://worcphotocenter.wetpaint.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://worcphotocente...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome your questions comments and contributions!&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing everyone again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Scott and I are always to try to greet everyone who comes to the meetups.
