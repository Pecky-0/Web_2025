Owned, constructed and maintained by Massport, Piers Park provides direct access to the waterfront along with spectacular views of downtown Boston across the inner harbor. Follow a 600-foot pedestrian promenade to two pavilions, which provide a view of the city skyline across the water, and four smaller shade pavilions. One pavilion honors the memory of Donald McKay, the noted builder of clipper ships whose facility was in East Boston. Piers Park Sailing Center, located in the park, provides an affordable and popular community-boating program. The park also features an amphitheater, an outdoor fitness system, and a large playground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner afterwarsds at &lt;br /&gt;Caffe Italia&lt;br /&gt;150 Meridian St&lt;br /&gt;East Boston, MA 02128 &lt;br /&gt;617.569.1800&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trattoriacaffeitalia.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trattoriac...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to the walk:&lt;br /&gt;Subway: &lt;br /&gt;Take the Blue Line to Maverick Square. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a left on Sumner Street, walk two blocks and take a right on Orleans Street.
