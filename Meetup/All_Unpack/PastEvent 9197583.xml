If you have ever thought about going to go see a ballet, now is the time!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Urban Nutcracker in a nut shell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-   Follows the story line of E.T.A. Hoffman's 19th century fairy tale set in contemporary Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-   Fuses ballet, swing, hip hop, and urban tap with the classical score of Tchaikovsky and the pulsating beat of Duke Ellington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-   Celebrates the rich diversity of Boston's urban communities and spotlights the talent of over 70 area children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-   Showcases an incredible array of set designs &amp;amp; costumes by Rebecca Cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Instead of trying to get around the ‘Nutcracker,’ BalletRox director Tony Williams, a former principal dancer with Boston Ballet, trans-formed the ballet into a multicultural celebration reflective of the world we live in... this is a ‘Nutcracker’ with attitude.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds good, huh?? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP soon, so we can get tickets! If we are more than 15 we can get a group discount!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be in Germany, like I said in my previous e-mail to you guys, but I will keep checking the web-site regularly and get the tickets as soon as I return from Germany! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see many of you at the ballet! Let's get into the Christmas-spirit together!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231550204000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227150296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ballet Rox presents: Urban Nutcracker!  </name><id>9197583</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229882400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/9197583/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
