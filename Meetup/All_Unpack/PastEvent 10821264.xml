I have selected Empire Garden because of my positive experiences there (listed as &amp;quot;Empire Garden&amp;quot;, also sometimes called &amp;quot;Emperor's Garden&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;**************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: black"&gt;Some of you might ask why Boston has two (2) separate August Moon Festivals - I'm not allowed to tell, I am only allowed to enjoy both - but feel free to do your own research on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there, and if not, Happy August Moon!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will wait with sign in front of entrance doors</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250615828000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246978660000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DIM SUM       August Moon Festival</name><id>10821264</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250433000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/10821264/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/3/global_9543011.jpeg</photo_url></item>
