&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a farmer to keep chickens. Terry Golson has more than sixteen years of experience keeping a small flock of laying hens in her backyard that supply eggs for her family's table. In this slideshow and lecture, Terry will share everything you need to know to get started with your own chickens. She'll cover selecting the right breeds, housing, feed, and how to keep the hens healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry will talk about chicken behavior, predators, and daily chores. She'll show you how she composts the manure and makes use of it in her garden. Terry speaks and writes frequently on this topic. You can find out more about her and her hens at www.HenCam.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry will also be bringing one of her very own live chickens to the presentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
