L. Mencken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Henry Louis (H.L.) Mencken, the Sage of Baltimore, was a Scholar, Writer, Editor, critic, humorist and Iconoclast who cared about people but savagely attacked Fundamentalist Religion, Politics and Racism.  He was born, the first of of his family, of German descent, in 1880 and died in 1956.  He was raised in Racism, and to love Germany.  He was racist himself for many years and was told by his first Editor that, “A dull notice is not worth printing.  Put slaughter in it and knock someone in the head every day.”  Finally he learned what was important, apologized for his racism, and counter attacked.  He is most famously known for his writing in support of Evolution and against Fundamentalism, at the Scopes Trial in Tennessee in the 1920's.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with thirty minutes of coffee and conversation at 7:30 p.m. The talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353382745000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350427521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting: Doug Peary on H.
