Established by funds bequeathed by William Rutherford Mead (Class of 1867), the museum occupies the original building opened in 1949 and renovated in 1999-2001.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mead Art Museum exhibits highlights from the permanent collection in six galleries, and presents temporary shows on contemporary art, photography, and interdisciplinary subjects highlighted by loans from public and private collections.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An accredited member of the American Association of Museums, the Mead participates in the consortium of the Five Colleges, Inc. as well as Museums10, a regional cultural collaboration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact&lt;br /&gt;Mead Art Museum&lt;br /&gt;Amherst College&lt;br /&gt;P.O.
