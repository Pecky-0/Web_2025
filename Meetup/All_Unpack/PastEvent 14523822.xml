We are returning to Montpelier to bid farewell to Sambel's restaurant.  You may recall that back in April, we organize a large flyin and had over 100 planes attend to help the restaurant in their battle with the State over their lease.  Their final day of operation is Sunday.  While not a victory in the $100 hamburg sense, it was a victory in that all the attention forced the state to buy out their lease rather than continue to harass them.  Anyway, we thought it would be nice to fly back and say goodbye.  They are opening early that day for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NEPilotsGroup/calendar/14503110/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Joel&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Gang,  Lets show our support for this cause and do what we do best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fly out and eat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are the ones that really benefits from this trip,  a short 105 NM hop to KMPV Edward F Knapp State Airport&lt;br /&gt;Barre/Montpelier, VTMont.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.navmonster.com/map/KFIT-KMPV-10"&gt;http://www.navmonster...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMPV"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan for wheels up out of Kfit at 10:30AM,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lets meet at Charlie's hanger for a short pilot brief before departure.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283096767000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282658818000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Airport Restaurant Sambel's Last Day, Montpelier, VT (KMPV)</name><id>14523822</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283092200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/14523822/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/a/global_17443882.jpeg</photo_url></item>
