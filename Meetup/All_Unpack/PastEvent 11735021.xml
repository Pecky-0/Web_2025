I'm hoping for a very big turnout.  Bring your puggies in costume.. there will be an award for Best Costume.  The puggies will also be bobbing for apples!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time attendees, we require proof of vaccinations for the rabies, distemper and canine cough.  Please check in at the front desk when you arrive.  If anyone would like to schedule a bath for after the meetup, please let me know ahead of time so I can advise my groomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone.  Please be sure to RSVP so I know how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agni&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Agni</member_name><member_id>8450793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257261010000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Pug-Lovers</urlname><id>1340523</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Pug Lovers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256760625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>HALLOWEEN - PARTY </name><id>11735021</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257087600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Pug-Lovers/events/11735021/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/3/1/global_7475937.jpeg</photo_url></item>
