<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>There will be a meeting to discuss the topics covered at the &lt;br /&gt;U of H Campaign School meetup meeting last week.  This will&lt;br /&gt;be the first meeting to launch our campaign plans and to discuss &lt;br /&gt;and determine what to do next regarding anchor events and &lt;br /&gt;funding of our efforts.  We will make an attempt to bring  &lt;br /&gt;members up to speed regarding the Official campaign strategy. &lt;br /&gt;If you haven't done so already be prepared to sign a non-disclosure &lt;br /&gt;agreement as it will be a prerequisite to any involvement at the meeting.  &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;   This will be the first of many Ron Paul Organizational meetings &lt;br /&gt;necessary to achieving a successful Presidential Campaign in &lt;br /&gt;Connecticut's Tolland County. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the Short Notice. If necessary we will arrange a make-up &lt;br /&gt;meeting for those who can not attend this Thursday Evening. &lt;br /&gt; Please bring your Campaign binder and plan on taking notes.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some new faces.  Please e-mail me for my home address &lt;br /&gt;if you plan on attending. -  danderson12(at)snet.net &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, &lt;br /&gt;Dave A. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191126703000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190737541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Preliminary Campaign Organizational Meeting</name><id>6424939</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190930400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/6424939/</event_url></item>
