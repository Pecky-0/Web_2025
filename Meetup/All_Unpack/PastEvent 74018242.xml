We will be out for 4 or 5 hours. I have five spots open. I will give preference to folks who have sailed with me before. In the past I have found that no shows are a problem with this website. I will need you to e mail me if your available and if for any reason you have to cancel let me know so I can give your spot to someone else. I will e mail you individual confirmations so you know if youâ€™re in. Water and some soda is on board, snacks to share are always appreciated. segallagheresq@comcast.net&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecast for Saturday...Sunny. Highs in the upper 70s. East winds 10 to 15 mph.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>sean</member_name><member_id>12819440</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343055716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342708721000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sail a Merritt 25 from Hull to the light houses</name><id>74018242</id><duration>18000000</duration><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342890000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/74018242/</event_url></item>
