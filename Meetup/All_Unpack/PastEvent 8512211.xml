Have you been to a drive in lately? Ever? Summer is the time to enjoy this kind of entertainment. Soon there may not be anymore left. So why not go, at least one more time, before it is too late.  They will show the movie rain or shine, even if only one person shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, August 16th, there are two movies: Wall-E, shown at 8:20pm and then IronMan. I have seen and loved Wall-E, and I hear that IronMan is a great adventure flick and worth seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Northfield Drive-In has a snack bar or you can bring your own goodies. If the night is warm, we can bring our lawn chairs and sit under the stars.  Their policy states that pets are welcome so long as they are quiet and you must clean up after them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location is about 45 minutes north of Amherst center and about 26 miles.  For directions, go to their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.northfielddrivein.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am in a black PT Cruiser with trout lic. plate FW 318K</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230575931000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218328523000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doggies at the Drive In</name><id>8512211</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218931200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/8512211/</event_url></item>
