We should be able to see Mars, Saturn, and some stars.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some more information from the Dexter School Clay Center Website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Weather permitting, and depending on what is in the sky each week, we will point the telescope toward some interesting objects which may include planets, the Moon, and stars.  Also enjoy a panoramic view of greater Boston from the observation decks, and walk among the constellations on the Stars Courtyard lit by fiber optics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operated by Dexter and Southfield Schools, the Clay Center for Science and Technology is a state-of-the-art astronomical observatory and learning center. In addition to the observatory's seven research-grade telescopes, this five story building contains sophisticated computer and science laboratories, a multi-media lecture hall, classrooms, dining, and meeting spaces, and a solar energy roof deck.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212711799000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209011385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exploring the Clay Center Observatory</name><id>7801502</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212538500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/7801502/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/e/0/global_3173088.jpeg</photo_url></item>
