<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This meetup is another alternative for getting together. The plan is to have a definite meeting each month on the first Thursday. Wanting to give others who can't do weeknights a daytime alternative, and we'll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From our discussion at the last daytime Meetup, I believe Thursday daytime was a good day for those who attended and had interest in coming back again.  I will change the day if my memory of which day was best is not accurate, so please email me if you were there and the day we picked was not a Thursday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tricia</member_name><member_id>4554719</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190485291000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>northofbostonlawofattraction</urlname><id>567480</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The North-of-Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188419155000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North-of-Boston Law of Attraction Daytime Meetup</name><id>6264898</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190296800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/northofbostonlawofattraction/events/6264898/</event_url></item>
