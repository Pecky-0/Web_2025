Look around and the crowd is a sea of smiling faces. Cold beer in hand, you’re feeling the vibe as the DJ’s start to turn the party out for a night of dance music under the stars. Welcome to our idea of paradise; we call it Dancing On The Charles, a deliberate reaction to the people’s desire for a return to grassroots nightlife. Big sound system, great DJs, electronic music, BBQ, dancing outdoors and affordable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dancing on The Charles is a team effort, produced by Boston underground electronic music visionaries Soul Clap and Marz Entertainment. Since its inception in early summer 2007 both attendance and media interest swelled. Crowds of 300+ flocked to the otherwise quiet riverside venue, consisting of people like local DJs, visual artists, retail industry, bloggers and music trendsetters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in 2008, partnered with Red Bull and The Weekly Dig, D.O.T.C. will be even bigger, boasting SEVEN event date, more DJs, VJs, a designer series where each event is paired with an artist to create a unique flyer and promotional apparel, advance ticket sales and even port-a-potty’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 @ the door&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the bald asian guy with glasses in T-shirts and jeans</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217289812000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1958</urlname><id>1096649</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge and Boston Singles Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216928423000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dancing On The Charles / Marz 9 Year Anniversary</name><id>8405191</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217116800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1958/events/8405191/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/8/global_3699192.jpeg</photo_url></item>
