The Harvard Museum of Natural History has an exciting series of lectures and classes that address these subjects. After all, the more we know about ourselves and our planet, the richer our lives will be. This week's event is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why We Cook: Food and Pairbonds in Human Evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lecture by Richard Wrangham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both our bodies and our societies have adapted to a cooked diet, which provides us with large amounts of energy and makes food easy to eat. On this Valentine's Day, Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham will describe the role that cooked food has played in human evolution and bonding, and the secrets of cooking dating back almost two million years to the origins of humanity. Part of the Evolution Matters lecture series. Free and open to the public at 24 Oxford Street in the Geological Lecture Hall.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Gluck</member_name><member_id>2864884</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215313844000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Citizens of the World</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Moveable-Feast</urlname><id>370532</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Moveable Feast</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199581231000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Why We Cook: Food and Pairbonds in Human Evolution</name><id>7040916</id><headcount>400</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203030000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast/events/7040916/</event_url></item>
