It has been a great year with fun events and lots of great people meeting each other and developing friendships. We are going back to the place where it all started one year ago- join us for dinner/drinks at John Harvard's Brewhouse in Shopper's World (Rt. 9) Framingham. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you there! If you have any ideas for future meet ups please share them at the event too.  Everyone pays for their own food/drink.  We will meet in the bar area, then get a table in the dining room.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo) near bar.
