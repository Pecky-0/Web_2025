Just about 2 miles past the scenic overlook on Rt. 16 on left North of North Conway.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;People come from great distances to cross country ski, snowshoe or drive from inn-to-inn along the trails of the 65 KM ski network to enjoy the spectacular scenery, warm hospitality, and great chocolate treats at stops throughout the network, many located along the trails. This may be the only day of the year when chocolate indulgence is totally guilt-free! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A festival map listing all the chocolate stops will soon be available online and on the day of the event when you purchase your ticket or at your first chocolate stop if you've purchased your ticket in advance. Each business will validate the Festival map to confirm your stop. More chocolate awaits the chocoholics that have completed the tour! Present your stamped Festival map on the day of the event to other North Conway area businesses for more special offers!
