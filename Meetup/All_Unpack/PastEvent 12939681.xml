A myriad of 19th century immigrants lived in this area situated along the flats along the South Bay and it eventually became home to the largest Chinese community in Boston. A unique mix of residences and family operated businesses, the intimate streets are lined with Chinese restaurants and specialty shops. Recently, Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians have further expanded the ethnic diversity of the neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guided tour traces Chinatown's rich cultural and architectural history, from 1875 to present day, and a vibrant convergence of old and new. The narrow streets and collection of 19th century buildings create an intimate atmosphere and unique look at Boston history for this 90-minute walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet near the Chinatown Gate. The tour is $15 for the general public and $5 for card-carrying BBF members and docents.
