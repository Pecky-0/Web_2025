<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For the August meetup, the Pugs are gathering once again in King Clovis's shady backyard in Brockton to chase squirrels along the top of the stockade fence and play hide and seek under the deck.  We hope you all can come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST MONTH'S MEETUP...&lt;br /&gt;Once again, we were blessed with excellent weather for the July meetup!  Twelve year old Oscar was a little surprised to see two dozen assorted Pugs and a couple of Frenchies and their people invade his peaceful and expansive backyard, but he recovered quickly and proved that no Pug is ever too old to enjoy a party!  Hot Pugs enjoyed a quick supervised dip in the pool or an impromptu run through the sprinkler, with plenty of fresh water to drink (or splash in) available in pots and dishes scattered across the yard, enjoyed by Pugs and baby Domani with equal enthusiasm! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and coffee, soft drinks, and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you and your Puggie(s) at our next meetup!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1155862929000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152472163000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug August Meetup</name><id>5015556</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155492000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5015556/</event_url></item>
