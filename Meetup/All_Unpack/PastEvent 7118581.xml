Discs are in the air, glowing brightly.&lt;br /&gt;Alone at home: you play with yourself. Only one disc is in the air, and it's not glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At frisbee: you're surrounded by pretty people all night long.&lt;br /&gt;Alone at home: you've only got yourself and your cat Mr. Squibbles. And Mr. Squibbles ain't so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At frisbee: you get to run around all night long in the cold.&lt;br /&gt;Alone at home: there's no running, only loneliness. There's no warmth either in your cold, bitter heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At frisbee: you hang out with cool folks afterward.&lt;br /&gt;Alone at home: you go to sleep at the end of the night, miserable and alone, another wasted day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At frisbee: you talk to cool people.&lt;br /&gt;Alone at home: you talk to yourself and your roommates think you're crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At frisbee: you make friends!&lt;br /&gt;Alone at home: you have no friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn't quite get the message, don't stay at home alone and sad. Come to frisbee! We are friendly and fun and sugar and spice and everything nice. 7 PM. Russell Field. Directions can be found on a previous Friday meetup, &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/calendar/7074781/"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring light-colored clothing, a change of socks (and extra clothing/shoes/etc.), your pets and grandparents, water, and money for food afterward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris M outta here.&lt;br /&gt;Call me, 781 301 1791, if you need any help finding the field.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be sitting on the bench alongside the football field or throwing an illuminated disc around.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim O'Neill</member_name><member_id>4585507</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214939046000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><why>We rock!</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200377531000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Illuminated Frisbee on Russell Field</name><id>7118581</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200700800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7118581/</event_url></item>
