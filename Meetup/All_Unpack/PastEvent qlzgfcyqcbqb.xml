We get pizza, drinks, and just have a great time talking and meeting new and like minded people in a very unofficial setting. It is a great time and all are invited to attend. Strongly suggested that you get there early to get a seat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cost to attend, but donations toward the cost of the pizza Dee buys are greatly appreciated if you are able. If not, it's not a problem. Any drinks you may want are not included in this though.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>10028347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326463331000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320085374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pagan Pizza Party!</name><id>qlzgfcyqcbqb</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326412800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/39383272/</event_url></item>
