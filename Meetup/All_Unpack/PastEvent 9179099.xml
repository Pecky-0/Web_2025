Book now and get one of the better sites! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a site on Horse Island, check out the campground map at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/library/pdf/campgrounds/PawtuckawayMap06.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhstatepar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I rented a canoe for the weekend and launched right from my campsite, it was great! I am going to take Monday off and make it a 3 day weekend - but join us however long you can. We will go canoeing/kayayaking and will improvise on some hikes.  There is a manned fire-watchtower we can hike to. Bring your own food and be prepared to cook and feed yourself. We can see about sharing when we are up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please indicate in your rsvp comment if you have made a reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Park description:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than 40 minutes to the coastal beaches to the east and to Manchester to the west, Pawtuckaway State Park Campground is well located for easy access to a variety of attractions and activities. All sites are wooded and many provide views of the lake. Each of the campsites has an open fireplace, picnic table, flat area for a tent, and a parking space. Although there are no hook-ups, recreational vehicles are welcome in sites where they fit. Running water, flush toilet facilities, a camp store, boat launch, and canoe and paddle boat rentals are available. Coin-operated showers are accessible 24 hours a day. Please remember that pets are not permitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pawtuckaway State Park offers a variety of landscapes, with something to do and see for everyone. There are many opportunities for hiking, with trails leading to many special points of interest, including a mountaintop fire tower; an extensive marsh where beavers, deer, and great blue herons may be seen, and a geologically unique field where large boulders called glacial erratics were deposited when glacial ice melted near the end of the Ice Age. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The campground sites line the shore of beautiful Pawtuckaway Lake. The park includes a large family beach on the lake with a bathhouse, a group picnic area, a playground, park store, and a group shelter with a ball field available by reservation only. Other activities in the park include biking, fishing, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pawtuckaway State Park&lt;br /&gt;128 Mountain Road&lt;br /&gt;Nottingham, NH 03290&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning on February 6, 2008 at 9:00 am, the dedicated toll-free number to call to make a reservation through the ReserveAmerica Call Center is 1-877-nhparks (1-877-647-2757).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complete list of new policies, as well as 2008 campground rates, will be posted on the ReserveAmerica site.   &lt;br /&gt;From I-93:&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 101 east to Exit 5 and follow signs to Pawtuckaway State Park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/state-parks/alphabetical-order/pawtuckaway-state-park/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhstatepar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244451837000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226943705000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Camping Weekend - Pawtuckaway June 2009</name><id>9179099</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244239200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9179099/</event_url></item>
