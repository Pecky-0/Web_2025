It's a French brasserie with an all French wine list.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money stuff:&lt;br /&gt;There is a fee of $21 to register for the event.  Of that, $20 is a deposit, which will be returned to you at the restaurant (in cash).  If you say that you're coming and then don't, you forfeit the $20.  I'm hoping that having a deposit will eliminate the guessing game about who is actually coming.   (So if 12 people RSVP &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; then 12 people will actually be at the restaurant. I made a reservation for 12.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remaining $1 is a non-refundable fee.  Part of this goes to Amazon Payments because they charge a transaction fee for the payment, and part of it will go to Meetup to help pay for the group's website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for "the Euro group"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>A</member_name><member_id>8074607</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243096099000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240868796000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our Favorite Restaurant</name><id>10279813</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241913600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/10279813/</event_url></item>
