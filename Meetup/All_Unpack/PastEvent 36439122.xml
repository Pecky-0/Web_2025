&lt;p&gt;Integral theory is an elegant and sophisticated map based on all the major methodological systems available in this time of history.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, as any theory, it has also had its share of criticism.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; A theory of everything has to make room for everyone, including dissenting views of its own map.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; As such, we will explore some of the ideas that tonight&amp;rsquo;s guest has explored in his recent book, "Bald Ambition: A Critique of Ken Wilber&amp;rsquo;s Theory of Everything."&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; With love and discernment, we will hold a mirror up to the AQAL map that has manifested from Wilber&amp;rsquo;s philosophical narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Meyerhoff&lt;/strong&gt;, M.A., L.S.W. is the author of "Bald Ambition: A Critique of Ken Wilber's Theory of Everything" and other essays on Integral theory, many that have appeared on &lt;a href="http://www.integralworld.net"&gt;IntegralWorld.net&lt;/a&gt;. He majored in economics and sociology and has studied philosophy, psychology, politics and spirituality. He's been employed as a social worker for the last 18 years. He has a weekly radio show, "The Ruminator," on WMFO that looks at current events, and runs a philosophical blog at &lt;a href="http://www.philosophyautobiography.blogspot.com"&gt;www.philosophyautobiography.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;. Jeff also presented a paper and was a panelist at the Integral Theory Conference in 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
