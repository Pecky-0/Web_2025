He's a rescue from an old kill shelter in Chicopee, MA. My guess was he was very scared and growly. No one wanted him. I still see little growls but going to dog club has helped.</bio><topics /><name>Roadie &amp; Heidi</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>7132973</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Tyngsboro</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/7132973</link><visited>1366466055000</visited><lon>-71.42</lon></member>
