&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : 18px"&gt;I cannot describe how much your support of the liberty message means to Carol and me. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Our victory at CPAC 2011 and your incredible response to the  Presidents' Day Money Bomb have                       shocked the  establishment and served notice that our Revolution  is alive and well  in this key                      political year. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As we end this  amazing week for Liberty PAC, I'm also excited about the opportunity                        I have this Saturday to speak at the Tea Party  Patriots' American  Policy Summit in Phoenix,                       Arizona. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; This gathering of &lt;span&gt;Tea Party groups&lt;/span&gt; and  grassroots activists will also feature a Presidential                        Straw Poll, where I believe we have another excellent chance to   demonstrate the strength of our movement. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; My speech is scheduled for 2pm MST.&amp;nbsp; For those of you in the Phoenix area, you can click                      &lt;a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/5437680:8122808865:m:1:234153996:C7E32E1803E7A42BB094282679671FB8" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about the Summit and how to obtain tickets. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; I know many of you would love to come but are just too far away to make  the trip, so                       I'm happy to report that you can  still be there through the Tea Party Patriots' "Virtual Summit"! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For only $10&lt;/strong&gt;, the Virtual Summit allows you to see the event live online                      and even vote in the Straw Poll.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Whether in Phoenix or at home, you can make your voice heard for                       limited government and individual liberty!  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Click &lt;a href="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/ct/5437681:8122808865:m:1:234153996:C7E32E1803E7A42BB094282679671FB8" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to register for the Virtual Summit.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; After you register, Summit organizers will send you your login and  password.  Details on voting in the Straw Poll will also be sent via  email. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Your support has already helped to gain critical  nationwide coverage for                      our  message.&amp;nbsp; Another  victory this week would further rattle the statists  and                       draw even more attention to our cause. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Can I count on your help again this Saturday? &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Thank you for all you do to defend the Republic and advance the principles that                      made this nation great. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; For Liberty, &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="http://paracom.paramountcommunication.com/cimages/9712f553eeb54df4c700abc96d8f0cb4/RPsig.jpg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 0px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298837058000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1298733073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul at Virtual Summit - Vote in Straw Poll for $10!</name><id>16712276</id><headcount>3900</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298754000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/16712276/</event_url></item>
