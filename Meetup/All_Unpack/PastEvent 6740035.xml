Dishes coming out of their kitchen include things as seemingly pedestrian as chicken parmigiana ($14.00, served over good-quality linguine) and as exotic as crispy duck leg with stewed lentils and baby greens (an appetizer for $9.00). Desserts, including white chocolate mouse in a dark chocolate shell with creme anglaise &amp;amp; raspberry puree ($7.00), also merit the serious diner's attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us at 7:00 PM on Thursday, November 29 as we travel down Route 18 to sample the fare of a restaurant that long ago achieved &amp;quot;institution&amp;quot; status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From The North:          &lt;br /&gt;         &lt;br /&gt;Take Route 3 South to exit 16B.
