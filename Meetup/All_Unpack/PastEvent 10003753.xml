So many were the deaths involved in its construction that the Hoosac Tunnel that it was referred to among the crew as the &amp;quot;Bloody Pit.&amp;quot;  After the accidents began piling up many workers came to feel that the tunnel was cursed and many of them refused to enter it again.  Some of the crew members simply walked off the job and did not return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT FORGET FLASHLIGHTS . THIS IS A ACTIVE TRAIN TUNNEL.
