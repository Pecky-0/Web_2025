&lt;p&gt;The Iron Lady revisits recent history through the eyes of the leader who shaped it&amp;mdash;charting the compelling rise and fall of trail-blazing politician Margaret Thatcher, the controversial former Prime Minister of the UK and the first woman ever elected as head of government in the West. Two-time Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep brings Margaret Thatcher to vivid life over a 40-year span, delivering a performance of great authenticity and sensitivity. Combining fact, fiction and poetic flights of imagination into a new breed of biopic, director Phyllida Lloyd (Mamma Mia!) creates a piercing portrait which reveals the many faces of Thatcher: the hard-nosed conservative; the woman who demolished the barriers of gender and class in a male-dominated world; the spirited wife and mother who longed to change her country for the better. Exposing the private life behind the headlines, The Iron Lady is a moving journey into the heart of an extraordinary, complex woman. Jim Broadbent co-stars. &lt;em&gt;Official Web Site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby after the movie holding a meetup sign, and we'll go to a local eatery for a discussion.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Caroline </member_name><member_id>10711981</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327452893000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326732506000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Iron Lady</name><id>48306692</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327267800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/48306692/</event_url></item>
