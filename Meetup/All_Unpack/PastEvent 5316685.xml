We will do the second Wed of January!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY 2007!! NEW FRIENDS ALL AROUND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time we're going to Natick!!!! So those who can't do Boston mid-week we better see you there :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monica has graciously offered to hostess us at her home for the evening, with cozy fireplace, comfy couches and snuggly puppy. We will give address/direction information to those coming (not going to post for all to see).  Should our response be too overwhelming for her home we will try Naked Fish for Cuban Cocktails on Rte 9. Good plan??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So THANK YOU Monica for your generous offer. Please do not hesitate to let us help bring food, beverages, etc. What kind of skills do we all have!? I can bake!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168646785000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1165672923000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>To NATICK!
