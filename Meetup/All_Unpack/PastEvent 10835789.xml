<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The most common texture for a knitted garment is that generated by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and T-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl. Other simple textures can be made with nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches. Adding a &amp;quot;slip stitch&amp;quot; (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches, and a number of more complicated patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255214136000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247106603000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tangled Yarns   -Thursday Oct 8th</name><id>10835789</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255041000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835789/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/c/global_9564588.jpeg</photo_url></item>
