The Tuscan Oven is very nice upscale establishment with a reputation for serving up some very tasty Italian dishes inspired by the cuisine of Tuscany...and they have a very beautiful patio in which they'll be hosting this special live music event...this may very well be the last outdoor nightclub show of the season, so let's all enjoy one of the last weekends of the summer!!!  The Tuscan Oven is located in the north end of Norwalk, next door to the Dept. of Motor Vehicles, close to the Rt. 7/Merritt Parkway interchange, with plenty of on site parking.  Showtime will be from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM, show will be out on the patio but may be moved into the restaurant if there's a threat of rain.
