Medicinal-grade essences carry the sacred message of the Plant and Tree kingdoms. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The combination of scent, energy and consciousness of these pure essential oils is a great aid in helping us remember our interconnectedness with all of Nature. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This beautiful journey will help you access profound inner wisdom and integrate that knowledge to become more empowered and fulfilled in your life. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Before the meditation begins, John will discuss the essences that were chosen for the meditation. He will also answer any questions you may have regarding aromatherapy, to help deepen your experience &lt;br /&gt;

 . &lt;br /&gt;

 Afterward, Erik will guide us into simple Qi Gong exercises, allowing for movement of energy through the body and to help open up your channel. This will aide in helping you to be more open for the meditation experience. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Several essences will then be applied followed by an hour long guided meditation accompanied by soothing music, drumming, vocal toning and energy healing. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 There will be time afterward for sharing, discussion and questions. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please keep in mind that you will be laying on your back for close to an hour. Bring blankets, pillows and anything else you might need to make it as comfortable an experience as possible. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 There will also be a crystal grid in the center of the circle to help enhance the energy. Feel free to bring anything you might like to add to the center grid to be blessed with the energy. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 It is always a beautiful and transforming experience. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
