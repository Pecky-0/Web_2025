You may bring pictures of your pugs that have crossed over the golden bridge or have help talking to your babies.   I wonder what Puddles is thinking.  LOL&amp;gt;  The price for a reading will be $20. which is a discount from $35.    You do not have to have a reading to come to meeting... While pugs and owners talk to each other with the help of Bety others will play in the back yard.   If you would like to bring snacks or drinks please email so I know what to count on.     Pug Hugs to all.
