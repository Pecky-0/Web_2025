The last time I was at this theater they had the  escalator blocked off, so we couldn't meet on the ground floor very easily.   Let 's meet upstairs, since this is going to be shown in one of the theaters upstairs.   When you come up the escalators there are some snack bars and some tables nearby.  I will be in that area.  I will snag a table if I can, but if not I will be in that area.  As usual, I will wear a badge so people new to the group can find me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next movie will be Mr. Bean's Holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Rowan Atkinson, Emma de Caunes, Jean Rochefort, Antoine de Caunes, Willem Dafoe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dotcomedy.com/bean/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dotcomedy....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Rowan Atkinson returns to the iconic role that made him an international star in &amp;quot;Mr. Bean's Holiday.&amp;quot; In his latest misadventure, Mr. Bean--the nearly wordless misfit who seems to be followed by a trail of pratfalls and hijinks--goes on holiday to the French Riviera and becomes ensnared in a European adventure of cinematic proportions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired of the dreary, wet London weather, Bean packs up his suitcase and camcorder to head to Cannes for some sun on the beach. Ah...vacation. But his trip doesn't go as smoothly as he had hoped when the bumbling Bean falls face first into a series of mishaps and fortunate coincidences, far-fetched enough to make his own avant-garde film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrongly thought to be both kidnapper and acclaimed filmmaker, he has some serious explaining to do after wreaking havoc across the French countryside and arriving at his vacation spot with a Romanian filmmaker's precocious son and an aspiring actress in tow. Will Bean be arrested by the gendarmes or end up winning the Palme d'Or? It's all caught on camera as Atkinson again applies his awkward athleticism to a comedy of errors in &amp;quot;Mr. Bean's Holiday.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188254389000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185979613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mr. Bean's Holiday</name><id>6108941</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188081000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/6108941/</event_url></item>
