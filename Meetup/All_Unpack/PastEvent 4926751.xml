We continue to work with dieticians, health professors and doctors. For example, we created Dr. Yvonne Chen's Herbal Energy Soup with the assistance of the former professor of Health Sciences at Worcester State College, and we also formulated our own healthy cooking oil. These innovations serve as examples of our commitment to using only the freshest products and finest ingredients. We plan to continue our mission to produce the healthiest Asian cuisine available in Worcester County. It has been a privilege to serve you for the past fifteen years and we look forward to serving you in the future. We thank you for your continued patronage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a large Vegetarian/Vegan listing and substitute veggie chicken, veggie shrimp or tofu into any of their entrees.
