During the last decades of the 19th century, the prominent architect was a passionate cyclist who was instrumental in creating and sustaining bicycle culture in Portland. In this photographic presentation, Sam Shupe will discuss 19th century bicycle culture in Maine, and explore the similarities between Stevens&amp;rsquo; approach to bicycling and his other cultural and artistic gifts to the state. Following his talk, Shupe will lead a leisurely bike tour of several Stevens-related sites in Portland&amp;rsquo;s West End. Bike tour will depart MHS at 5pm and conclude at approximately 6:30. Bring your bike! Program and bike ride are free but registration for bike ride is required. Please call 774-1822 to register.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Presenter and Ride Leader: &lt;strong&gt;Sam Shupe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
