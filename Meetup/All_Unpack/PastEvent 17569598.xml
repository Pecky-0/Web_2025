Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;strong&gt;get there early . . . even before 7:15 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the "staff only" signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box. Mass Ave buses (to points in Arlington and North Cambridge) originate in Harvard Square on the Red Line and travel along Massachusetts Avenue, which is about a 10-minute walk from the auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information and directions, go to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. (If you are in the screening room, turn right when you exit.) You can also look for me and my meetup sign up on the roof as we wait in line to take a look through the telescopes.&amp;#65279;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of exciting objects to observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author's&amp;nbsp;Night&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, May 24, 2011,&amp;nbsp;Richard Panek&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&amp;#65279;&amp;#65279;"We're at the beginning of a new way of looking at the universe, and there's no way of knowing what will happen."-Richard Panek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;. . . Richard Panek . . . will be presenting his new book, "The 4-Percent Universe." Every generation, if they're lucky, faces a problem that can't be ignored -- a problem that makes us question what we know about ourselves and the cosmos. It just so happens, 96 percent of our universe is missing. Everything astronomers have ever seen, detected, or measured comprises only 4 percent of what's out there. The rest remains a grand mystery -- and a story Richard Panek could not resist telling.&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event is starting a bit later than previous CfA events, and not much is open very late on Tuesdays. Options include the Algiers Coffee House in Harvard Square and Christopher's in Porter Square. But let's see what people (including me!)&amp;nbsp;feel like doing on Tuesday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup sign.
