We will remember the execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two Italian immigrants and committed anarchists whose trial is widely regarded as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case touches upon many of our contemporary struggles against the war, for migrant workers rights, for freedom of expression, against the oppression of the state, for equal justice for all, against racism, against the death penalty, for the radical change of society, but above all for human rights and human dignity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in Copley Square to march through downtown Boston to the Paul Revere Mall in the North End (416 Hanover St.), where we will conclude with a rally.
