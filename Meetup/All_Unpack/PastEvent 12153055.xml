Here is the talk description from the dharmaseed.org website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the concept that mindfulness cultivates insights which lead to wisdom to manifest as compassion that is experienced as joy, this talk is about 1) the joy of awakened physical awareness, 2) the joy of psychological clarity, 3) the joy of knowing universal truth, 4) the joy of service and 5) the joy of realizing the basic goodness of human beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us in mindful community as we seek to gain greater awareness of understanding in our lives. All levels of meditators and practitioners welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262214834000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261935106000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Joy of Mindfulness</name><id>12153055</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262041200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/12153055/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/1/global_12020385.jpeg</photo_url></item>
