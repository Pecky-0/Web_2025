&lt;p&gt;As we all watched the dramatic events unfold last week in Boston, Cambridge and Watertown it made me think what can we do to help those that were most affected by the tragic events surrounding the Boston Marathon? I have decided to organize a fundraiser to benefit the One Fund Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towne Bar and Sprits, a restaurant located on the marathon route at 900 Boylston Street has graciously donated some space for us to hold a fundraiser this Friday evening from 6-8 PM. There will be complimentary appetizers from towne and we are asking for a suggested donation of 10 dollars at the door. We will also be having a raffle with some great prizes. More details will be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you on Friday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
