Thai yoga bodywork yields results similar to those obtained by modern Western myofascial techniques (Rolfing, structural integration, etc) as well as the effects of energy work (acupuncture/acupressure, Reiki, polarity).  Thai yoga bodywork invites the deep release of physical and psycho-emotional tension while invigorating the nervous system, balancing the immune response and restoring body-mind resilience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The presentation will include a demo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross Knights has five years experience practicing Thai yoga bodywork and teaching power vinyasa yoga, on a foundation of over ten years of study of yoga and assorted martial arts.  A certified Thai-Shiatsu bodyworker and register yoga teacher, Ross studied Thai bodywork with Kripalu scholar-in-residence Ken Nelson and with Jonas Westring.  He has pursued advanced Thai massage training in Chaig Mai, Thailand.  He has also studied mind-body healing modalities at Esalen Institute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetings begin with a potluck lunch and time to get to know everyone in the group a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP, let us know what you will bring to the potluck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 meetup fee.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will welcome you at the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1255104647000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247670258000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup:  Thai Yoga Bodywork</name><id>10881979</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252683000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/10881979/</event_url></item>
