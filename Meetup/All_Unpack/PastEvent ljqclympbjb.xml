<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone!!  Last month we had 39 people at our meetup!  It is an amazing happening!  We are all starting to realize that we need to take control of our lives beginning with what we eat!  Our meetup is a cross section of all ages, and backgrounds.  The conversation is always lively and the raw food creations are better than what you would get at any raw restaurant!  So if you are a die hard raw foodee or just testing the waters, so to speak, this is the place for you!  This will be the last gala at my house.  Staring in Dec we will be meeting at the Executive Court Inn.  We are so lucky to get such an incredible spot!  I have already started working on getting some presenters for 2010.  Potluck.....please bring a raw food dish enough for 6-8 people (so we can all have a taste).  Please make sure it is all organic.  If you are not sure what to bring give me a call or google raw food recipes.  See you on Nov 6!  Cheers!
