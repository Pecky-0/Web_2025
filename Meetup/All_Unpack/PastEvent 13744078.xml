<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello All, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating the final details for this meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us meet at Besito for Dinner at 7.15 PM and watch the 9.40 show.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to get my tickets before dinner. You could probably get the tickets right before the show. But since its the second day of the release and the movie seems to be a box office and this theater is relatively small, it might be a good idea to get the tickets a little advance.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theater is right next to the restaurant. I have made a reservation for eight for dinner for 7.30 PM.  Please let me know by Friday if you are &lt;b&gt;NOT JOINING&lt;/b&gt; for dinner. I would like to update the reservation with an accurate count. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be at the bar area around 7.15 PM and will also share my cell phone number with those who RSVP'ed Yes or May be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the address of the restaurant: &lt;br /&gt;Besito - West Hartford &lt;br /&gt;46 South Main Street &lt;br /&gt;West Hartford, CT 06107  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://besitomex.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://besitomex.com/...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synopsis: &amp;quot;Grown Ups&amp;quot;, starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, and David Spade, is a comedy about five friends and former teammates who reunite years later to honor the passing of their childhood basketball coach. With their wives (Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph) and kids in tow, they spend the Fourth of July holiday weekend together at the lake house where they celebrated their championship years earlier. Picking up where they left off, they discover why growing older doesnâ€™t mean growing up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277663952000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276050362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grown Ups at Blue back square</name><id>13744078</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277594100000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/13744078/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/a/global_15603706.jpeg</photo_url></item>
