This film has the depth and beauty of a 16th century masterpiece. Leonardo and Patt Defilippis play all the main characters, including John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila, and the film includes a cast of more than sixty extras. St.  John's mystical poem 'The Spiritual Canticle' runs as a connecting thread through the piece and the suspenseful story keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. St.  John of the Cross is also well known for his book, 'the Dark night of the Soul.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can come to enjoy this inspiring movie with us, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am easy to find.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202085336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>We project the movie onto the wall, there is a good atmosphee, good people, good food and a GREAT Movie.</why><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201550118000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MOVIE  ~ St John of the Cross</name><id>7214696</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201912200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/7214696/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/8/global_1017208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
