Travel will occur on both official and unofficial trails including a bushwhack through the Pemigewasset Wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our plan is take the Lincoln Woods Trail to Black Pond.  From here we will bushwhack north to the Lincoln Brook Trail to the foot of the Owlshead slide and follow an unofficially maintained trail to the viewless summit.  It is estimated bushwhacking from Black Pond will save about one mile each way in addition to avoiding a number of difficult brook crossings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only experienced hikers able to go at a moderate plus pace equal to book time or better should sign up for this trip.&lt;/b&gt;  Group size is limited to 8 participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the NEHAAG disclaimer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gear List, Mandatory:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Topo Map &amp;amp; Compas&lt;br /&gt;Food and Water: Plenty of high-energy snacks and at least four quarts of water.
