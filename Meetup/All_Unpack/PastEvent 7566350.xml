Unprecedented! Diesel Lounge is really a cool little place, and they're normally closed on Mondays but are opening up especially for the NHC. That's right, we're doing exclusive NHC happy hours two weeks in a row! Unprecedented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian, the manager, is not only openings just for us but is also graciously granting us $1 off ALL drinks -- beer, wine, well drinks, martinis, you name it, $1 off EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a little bit of a departure from the norm, this is a BYOF happy hour. Diesel doesn't serve food, and Brian said he's fine with us bringing any food we want, and even ordering pizza or chinese if we want. I, for one, will come bearing Raisinets. For you see, March 24 is National Chocolate Covered Raisins Day (&lt;a href="http://www.candyusa.org/Classroom/calendar.asp" target="_blank"&gt;no, seriously, it is&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian also said that we're welcome to bring CD's to play some tunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your NHC contact for the evening: Ben (203) 554-5144&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206579670000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205972480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mon. 3/24 - Monday Happy Hour @ Diesel Lounge</name><id>7566350</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206396000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7566350/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
