<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a rail-trail that follows the route of the Farmington canal from New Haven to Northampton, Ma. After the line was abandoned, it was converted into a nice trail, with pavement, benches, and trees. We will be walking the Avon to Simsbury section of the trail. For more information see www.traillink.com. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This will be an easy walk of about 5 miles with level walking. Social walking pace. We will be out for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Location: Approximate address, no mailbox there, GPS not guaranteed to lead you there. 104 route 10, Avon, CT. Google maps do not recognize Hopmeadow St in Avon. It will direct you to Simsbury, the wrong location. &lt;br /&gt;

At the traffic light, turn into the combined driveway for Avon Wellness Center and Sperry Park. There is a trail parking lot on the right, but it is too small for our use. Turn to the extreme right and follow the park road past the baseball fields to a larger lot at the end. &lt;br /&gt;
