<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Holcomb Farm is an historic farm used by seven generations of the Holcomb family.  The farm was donated to the public for agricultural and educational purposes.  They have a nature center, an arts program, and a community supported agricultural operation.  We will be hiking to see a viewpoint on the mountain side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may visit the center after our walk if you like.  Admission is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 to 3 miles with one big hill to climb.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  I have visited this lookout one time, and I will be following the trail map.  The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.  Dogs must be on leash at all times, (local rules).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  113 Simsbury Rd, West Granby, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=holcomb+farm,+granby,ct&amp;amp;sll=41.766098,-72.727449&amp;amp;sspn=0.039435,0.071239&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=holcomb+farm,&amp;amp;hnear=Granby&amp;amp;ll=41.95732,-72.835236&amp;amp;spn=0.019659,0.03562&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>22</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277246656000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275573858000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holcomb Farm Walk, West Granby, CT</name><id>13683667</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277055000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/13683667/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
