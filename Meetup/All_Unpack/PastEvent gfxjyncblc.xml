Please introduce yourselves and feel free to ask for help from each other. It is usually helpful if everyone starts with one conversation partner and then changes partners after 15 or 20 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had hoped to come to this meeting myself, I may be away with a family issue unfortunately, so in case I don't see you this time, have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>print a sign and bring it so you can meet each other!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264894655000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261701637000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston English as a Second Language January Meetup</name><id>gfxjyncblc</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264721400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/12144016/</event_url></item>
