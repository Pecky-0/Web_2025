We'll meet in the parking lot at 5:30 and start walking promptly at 5:45.  Expect to be out for about 90 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a socially paced relatively easy walk over rolling terrain, with some interesting features and views.  If it's still hot, you may want water and bug repellant may not be a bad idea either.  Last time I was there, the trails had some muddy spots, so consider your footwear as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park information at &lt;a href="http://www.northwestpark.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.northwestpark.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids and dogs welcome.  Park rules require a leash (on the dogs, not the kids, use your own judgement there!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
