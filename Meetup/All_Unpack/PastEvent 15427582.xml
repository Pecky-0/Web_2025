Whatever holiday you celebrate bring it with you to share with whomever is here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's celebrate the season and reflect on good things that have come our way in 2010 and get ready for (gulp) 2011. I am inviting all to share this holiday at my house. The situation is the same as past wine tasting events...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine night at my house... on a Sat December 4, 2010! in Cheshire CT 6pm - 10 pm + &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvres or desert. Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing.. &lt;br /&gt;Reds Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, shiraz pinot noir, &lt;br /&gt;whites - &lt;br /&gt;sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a persons spot if you do not show up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to all the &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs, due to this being a private residence. It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly. I will have water and coffee too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise Brown</member_name><member_id>10321540</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291580080000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Winos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup</urlname><id>593834</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven  Wine and Dining  Meetup Group,</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289585244000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Holiday Wine Party"At Ralphs House"</name><id>15427582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291503600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup/events/15427582/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/7/d/global_2165245.jpeg</photo_url></item>
