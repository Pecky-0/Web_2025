Their high level of knitting skill can be seen in several items found in the tombs in the Abbey of Santa Maria la Real de Huelgas, a royal monastery, near Burgos, Spain. Among them are the knitted cushion covers and gloves found in the tomb of Prince Fernando de la Cerda, who died in 1275. The silk cushion cover was knit at approximately 20 stitches per inch. It included knit patterns reflecting the family armory, as well as the word baraka (&amp;quot;blessings&amp;quot;) in Arabic in stylized Kufic script. Numerous other knit garments and accessories, also dating from the mid-13th century, have been found in cathedral treasuries in Spain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260056233000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247107212000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cast Off -Thursday Dec 3rd</name><id>10835913</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259883000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835913/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/2/global_9564706.jpeg</photo_url></item>
