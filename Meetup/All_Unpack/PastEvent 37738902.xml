So for those of you who are looking to do a century, be it metric or standard this is a chance to see how you do on a nice brisk ride ( I could go faster if you want). Would like to start at the first parking lot on Veterans Memorial Parkway. This is a decent place to start. I would also like to do a loop or 2 through Colt State park, just to add a mile or two more. This will also include a stop for people to take a small break if they feel the need to do so. This is also weather permitting. If it rains, its a no go. If its just a litttle cold, ITS ON.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>LennI</member_name><member_id>11853599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319389976000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318887848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike East Bay Bike Path/Colt Park 12:00 PM</name><id>37738902</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319385600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/37738902/</event_url></item>
