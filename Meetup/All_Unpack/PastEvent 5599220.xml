I've made a reservation for 25 people and have expanded the number of RSVP's accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as is the custom, I'll be holding a Meet-Up sign near the front row when the movie ends. Since Coolidge Corner tends to rush people out after a movie we will also organize in the alleyway/entrance outside the theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175555189000</updated><rating><average>4.55999994278</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174694725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"The Namesake" at Coolidge Corner</name><id>5599220</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175382000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5599220/</event_url></item>
