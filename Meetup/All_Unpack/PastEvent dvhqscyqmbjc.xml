&lt;p&gt;Feeling good is also the vibrational means to get the "things" that you want!  So that's cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So join us in this evening as we all share and play with some of our favorite strategies for amping up our feeling good state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine how good you're going to feel by the end of this night as we do one feeling good process after another!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please remember, when you RSVP "yes", we expect you, prepare for you, and look forward to you being with us!  If&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;your plans change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, please be considerate of us as your hosts, and let us know by changing your RSVP or e-mailing Ann at annide@newpossibilitiescoaching.com.  Most of you have been really good about this lately, and we really appreciate it!  Thank you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000080"&gt;Eagerly looking forward to feeling good with you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
