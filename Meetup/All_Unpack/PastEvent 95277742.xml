&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;This is a pot luck event!  Please bring food (appetizers, main dishes, sandwiches, veggies, desserts) and beverages (soft drinks, wine, champagne)! We will use the first hour of the meeting to celebrate anything and everything related to the holiday season and trading. Had a good year in the Markets? We'll celebrate! Had a bad year? We'll commiserate! You get the idea. We will eat in the lounge area outside Room 315. Use the time to network, pick the brains of your fellow traders and introduce yourself to some of the members you haven't yet met. Please fill out a name tag and wear it. And remember - we do want to celebrate responsibly. I don't want anyone driving home intoxicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; font-size : large"&gt;Market Talk by Basil Chapman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;We will have a market talk. Basil Chapman of Chapman Wave and Tiger Financial Network will present.  Basil has told me that&lt;/span&gt; this is now the perfect time to be going over the patterns that he described at the last meeting, and what has unfolded.  Timing is everything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a friend you talk stocks with, bring them with you! Food or drinks are not allowed in any MIT meeting room. We strongly urge each person to make his or her own decisions about investing their money. Investment ideas and recommendations made during our meetings and in our online dialogs bear no liability by anyone. This is a free and open meeting. No membership is required, but please RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff Orrik</member_name><member_id>1135788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356147029000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Investor$ who think 4 themselve$</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonIBD</urlname><id>81154</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Investor's Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355443749000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Investors Group Holiday Party/Meeting</name><id>95277742</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355961600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/events/95277742/</event_url></item>
