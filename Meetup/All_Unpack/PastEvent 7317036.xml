We like to keep this group free so as to encourage members to join and see the benefits of re-establishing their unmarried social life.  Many people have found this group to be an invaluable way to re-enter the social scene after a divorce.  We find friends to offer advice, enjoy social activities with and just general camaraderie.  If this group has been helpful to you and you would like to contibute towards the renewal fees any help would be greatly appreciated.  You can give me donations at an event you are attending or contribute via Paypal.  I set this up as an event because it was the only way I knew how to include the Paypal option.  Any amount of contribution is welcome but I had to put an amount in the box for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202835859000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Group Renewal</name><id>7317036</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203634800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/7317036/</event_url></item>
