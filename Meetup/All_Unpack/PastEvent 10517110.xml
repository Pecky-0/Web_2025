We will meet in the parking lot at Easton's Beach (First Beach for you Newport Folks) at 6:00 and then bike  Ocean Drive.  This bike ride should take approximately an hour  at a leisurely pace.  Afterwards we will go to Tickets for dinner and drinks.  Sorry to disappoint some of you, but to avoid injuries we will not be drinking beer and riding bikes simultaneously.    &lt;br /&gt;Please do not RSVP maybe because it takes a slot away from someone who wants to attend.  If an event is full and you would like to join, please email me directly.  &lt;br /&gt;See you then,&lt;br /&gt;Paula&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the parking lot near the playground.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250950049000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243545202000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike and Beer</name><id>10517110</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244757600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/10517110/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
