And we can't miss having a good time on Beacon Hill, with all those beautiful gardens and spaces. We'll check out the art (maybe even buy something) for a couple of hours and then take a break at a local establishment. Bring water just in case its hot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year the Walk celebrates its 20th Anniversary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Art Walk is an annual event that takes place on the first Sunday in June, throughout the nooks and crannies of Beacon Hill. Residents open up their private gardens, alleyways, and courtyards and allow artists to display and sell their artwork. It is a chance for visitors to tour for free the private spaces of Beacon Hill while viewing original artwork. Thousands attend each year. It is a popular event in the neighborhood, with a festive atmosphere and volunteer musicians playing in various gardens throughout the day. Around 100 artists usually participate, with a variety of styles, media, and subject matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Starting Points: 135 1/2 Charles Street&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The week before the show, there will be a phone number posted here to call after 8 am on Sunday June 6th to find out if &amp;quot;Sunny Day&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Rainy Day&amp;quot; locations are in effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/visual-art-appreciators-boston/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beaconhillartwalk.org/"&gt;Beacon Hill Art Walk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a small meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Q.</member_name><member_id>2269958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275923017000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274905507000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beacon Hill Art Walk</name><id>13605025</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275843600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/13605025/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/d/7/global_15316055.jpeg</photo_url></item>
