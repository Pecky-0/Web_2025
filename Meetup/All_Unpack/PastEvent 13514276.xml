That means being more mindful of how we often get addicted to using the phone, computer or television as a means to distract ourselves and keep our minds occupied. Turning off your phone, computer, and/or television for one day a month can be a reminder to slow down, to be more aware of ourselves and the world around us. It's also a good time to be social, if that's what you enjoy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'd like to offer my home as a gather place that evening for a pot luck cookout. Please bring something to eat and drink, and I'll provide an outdoor grill and plates/cups/utensils. I hope you can join us in mindful community as we seek to increase our awareness and cultivate more wisdom and compassion into our lives.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be around, it's a big yellow house with green shutters</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274707771000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274143985000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lo/no Tech Meetup Potluck</name><id>13514276</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274648400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/13514276/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
