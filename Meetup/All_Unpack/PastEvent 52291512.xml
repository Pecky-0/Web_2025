<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Time for another work out in the Fells. &amp;nbsp;Instead of heading to the gym, this trail run is aimed to get our heart rate going. &amp;nbsp;You should be able to jog at approx. 9:30min/mile to join this meet up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is offered to both "Hike the Medford Fells" and the "Random Group of Hikers" with 4 spots for sign up for each group (for a total of 9 runners). &amp;nbsp;Please only sign up for this event once, even if you are a member of both meet up groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to run the Skyline trail (approx 7.5mi) in under 2hours. &amp;nbsp;Bring 2.5hours of your time with you in case we are slower due to the ground conditions. &amp;nbsp;We may be fast-paced walking as opposed to jogging in places. &amp;nbsp;The trail has plenty of rocks that may be slippery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring something to drink (and possibly eat). To clarify: this is a workout, not a conversational meetup. Please do NOT sign up for this run if you are not planning on jogging the entire trail as it will slow down the entire group. &amp;nbsp;Along the same lines, please do not sign up for this meet up if you are a fast runner (e.g. 8min/mile split times) as you most likely will get frustrated with the 'slow' pace of the group--unless you are fine with running slower. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To challenge yourself feel free to bring along your hiking backpack filled with winter hiking gear. &amp;nbsp;As we still don't have snow, this may be the only way our snowshoes will see the Fells this winter. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be leaving the parking lot at 10:05am and plan to return to the parking lot no later than 12:05pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No break scheduled during this loop run. &amp;nbsp;We are doing this as a group to help each other out whenever needed, keep each other on the correct trail ( :) ) and push each other to have a good workout.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to our run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.s.: Please note that the address may not be matching with the actual location of the Long Pond parking lot. &amp;nbsp;The parking lot is clearly labeled and located on the side of the Fells (and not across the street) on South Border Rd.&lt;/p&gt;
