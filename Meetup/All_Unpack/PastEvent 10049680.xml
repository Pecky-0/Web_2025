This was the site of an historic mill town in pre Civil War days.  The town had a saw mill, which burned, a woolen mill, which burned, and a paper mill, which as you guessed, burned.  The mill pond is now used for swimming and there are about 12 miles of hiking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 3 miles on gentile terrain.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 to 3 hours.  Rain cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  We will meet at the winter parking lot on the right as you enter.  If this is closed, continue straight in to the park and meet at the first lot on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Hebron&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=421+North+St" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk is being lead by Larry.
