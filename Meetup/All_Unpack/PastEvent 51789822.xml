We'll begin with some fun cardio dance that includes belly dance, latin dance, and hip hop. Next, we'll use a chair, ball, and resistance bands to tone, tighten, and build lean muscle. We'll finish up really breaking a sweat learning and rehearsing a fun and flirty chair routine! You'll actually have some fun while getting in shape! *To attend you must register here at least 24 hours before the class: &lt;a href="http://bridgetsdancestudio.com/registerforadultclass.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://bridgetsdances...&lt;/a&gt; You don't have to pre-pay, just enter some basic info so the instructor knows you're coming. Classes are $7 each or $60 for a ten pack (can be combined with Bootcamp, Trim&amp;amp;Tone, Hip Hop, Pilates and Zumba) Wear comfortable clothes and sneakers, you will work up a sweat :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christie</member_name><member_id>11635611</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329669104000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328844604000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Strip Fit</name><id>51789822</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329663600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/51789822/</event_url></item>
