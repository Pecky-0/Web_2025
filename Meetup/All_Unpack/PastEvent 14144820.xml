My Address is 76 Lincoln Ln, North Grafton and I included directions below from the MA Pike and from Rte 146 (coming from the south).
 
Directions to Kim's house

From MA Pike - Exit 11 (Worcester Millbury)

Take right @ light on to Rte 122 South

Go about .6 miles then take right on to Brigham Hill Rd.

Take right at stop sign on to Deernolm St (no street sign)

Take first left on to Lordvale Blvd; this is directly after a MA Pike overpass bridge.

Take 2nd left on to Lincoln Lane; intersection at top of the hill (after 4-way stop).

Take a left after entering the new Lincoln Lane section of the complex. Note: there is a left turn before entering the newer section but it is not well marked and goes to the older complex; some people see it, some do not.

My unit is at the right end of the building (when facing it), closest to the new construction, #76.

From Rte 146 coming from the south â€“ Exit 8 (W Main St/Millbury)

Turn right at the end of ramp - Elm St

Go through 2 sets of lights then turn left at CVS on to Canal St (bridge is out, so you must go left)

Take left at light onto Riverlin St

Go about 2.4 miles then take right on to Lordvale Blvd

Take 2nd left on to Lincoln Lane; intersection at top of the hill (after 4-way stop).

Take a left after entering the new Lincoln Lane section of the complex. Note: there is a left turn before entering the newer section but it is not well marked and goes to the older complex; some people see it, some do not.
