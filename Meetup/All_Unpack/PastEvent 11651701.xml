The exit says Concord St./Wingearsheek Beach.  don't take the 133 exit.  &lt;br /&gt;At the end of the ramp take a left and go along a very windy road until you see the sign for Wingearsheek Beach, take that right and then go all the way to the end to the parking lot.  &lt;br /&gt;Camp Sprindrift will be on your right awhile before the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;It's very dark and windy so be careful driving there!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come if you dare this October into the woods of West Gloucester! Relive the horror that took place many moons ago on the grounds of Camp Spindrift. This re-creation of the haunting tale “The Legend of Red Eyes, The Tale of Fly Eagle, The Indian Chief of The Spindrift Tribe” includes a spooky train ride, never ending maze, fortune tellers, and more!  Stop by and see if you feel the spirits that are said to still haunt these grounds where the Spindrift Indians once called home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meetup:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Park at Wingaersheek Beach and take shuttle to the camp, we will be in the parking lot of Wingaersheek Beach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; $10.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TIME&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note we will only wait for 15 minutes after scheduled meetup time to head out to to the destination, if you think that you will be running late, please email me or call before hand so we can make other arrangements.  &lt;br /&gt;Remember to dress appropriately.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/shock.gif' border='0' alt='shock' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will see you in the beach parking lot.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257118846000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255836328000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Haunted Tale of Red Eyes at Camp Spindrift!</name><id>11651701</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256945400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/11651701/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/4/global_11269524.jpeg</photo_url></item>
