<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This event is all about International Arthouse..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so Excited.. I will be hosting Boston Slow Art Day 2012 at the MFA this year. This is an International, and multi-cities across the country produced event. Not only will it be happening here in Boston at the MFA, Worcester and Salem also have planned hosting for this slow down and enjoy the arts day. Check out SlowArts website to see where.(www.slowartday.com)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does It work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day each year &amp;ndash; April 28 in 2012 &amp;ndash; people all over the world visit local museums and galleries to look at a small number of pre-selected works for 5 to 10 minutes each. After their individual viewing, participants meet together over lunch to talk about their experience. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Simple by design, the goal is to focus as much attention as possible on viewing art slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2010 ARTNews full-page feature article, Slow Down You Look Too Fast, (&lt;a href="http://www.artnews.com/2011/04/01/slow-down-you-look-too-fast/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.artnews.co...&lt;/a&gt;) provides an excellent overview of Slow Art Day. Here's the website to find out more info: &lt;a href="http://www.slowartday.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.slowartday...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost is just the price of museum admission and lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #3366ff"&gt;Here is the link to officially register: &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2906576649/efblike" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.eventbrite...&lt;/a&gt;. Please RSVP here as well to let other group members know if you are planning to attend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me know if you would be interested in co-hosting. Which would involve choosing the pieces to view together and possibly leading a table during lunch depending on size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still working out the lunch reservation which will be at one of the four dining venues at the museum. The meeting time for lunch will probably be at 1:00. Details to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;So, I think it's fitting to post this opportunity to members of this group. For me, going out and discussing the movie we just saw has been extremely value.. So, I thought being like minded, you would really get a lot out of this day. Updates will be posted as the event draws near.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
