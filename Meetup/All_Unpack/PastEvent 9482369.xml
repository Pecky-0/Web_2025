Thank you!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; January 18th, 2009 at 9:30a.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; Castle Neck / Crane's Beach, Ipswich, MA &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Place:&lt;/b&gt; Crane's Beach Parking Lot &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking Fee&lt;/b&gt;: $7 payable at the gate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAPE Group member, Jim Cahoon, will be leading our January event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see below for more information from Jim:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;CAPE group will visit Castle Neck, just to the South East of the parking lot of Crane's Beach in Ipswich, on Sunday January 18th. As a bad weather day alternative, we will reschedule it for Sunday, January 25. We will meet in the parking lot, of Crane's Beach, at 9:30 AM, at which time I will hand out detailed maps of the area we will explore. This area will include the INLAND trails (Green, Red, &amp;amp; Blue), of Castle Neck, SE of Crane's Beach, as shown on the &amp;quot;Crane Estate Trail Map&amp;quot;, found in the &amp;quot;Files&amp;quot; section of our web site. &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.c.." target="_blank"&gt;http://files.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend dressing warmly as it is always colder by the water. I wear two layers of long underwear, more layers on top of that, comfortable warm hiking boots, warm headgear, and an extra pair of gloves. You can always remove layers if needed along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would expect to be back to our cars by noon, at which time I'm sure someone can suggest a place to warm up, and get some hot chocolate.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; CAPE Group charges $1 per meeting/per photographer in order to cover the cost of our Meetup.com website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232896571000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231470859000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crane's Beach/Castle Neck</name><id>9482369</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232289000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/9482369/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_3584529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
