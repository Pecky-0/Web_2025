&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Join me at the opening of The RISD Faculty Biennial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longstanding tradition, this is an exciting opportunity to view new studio work by the artists and designers who teach at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). The 2011 Biennial was really great, and I highly recommend going to check it out! However, if you miss the opening, it will be on view until March 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Info:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented in the RISD Museum’s Chace Center Galleries and the Gelman Student Gallery, the 2013 RISD Faculty Biennial occupies two floors of the Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tremendous response from the RISD faculty has made it possible to show works by 197 full- and part-time faculty. The works featured are as varied as the many departments and divisions in which the faculty teach — ranging from apparel, textiles, painting, printmaking, ceramics, glass, sculpture, illustration, photography, jewelry, and metalsmithing to graphic design, industrial design, architecture, landscape architecture, interior architecture, film, animation, digital media, furniture, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curator and Director of Campus Exhibitions Mark Moscone says that the broad participation makes this “Again, a very comprehensive showing of faculty work.” He adds that many faculty artists and designers are creating work specifically for the faculty biennial, and there are also a number of collaborative projects between faculty members this year. &lt;br /&gt;
