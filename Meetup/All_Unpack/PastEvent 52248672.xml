HOW IT WAS PRODUCED? WHO CONTROLS IT? THE HUMAN &amp;amp; ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF THAT FOOD? Drawing on Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation and Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, director Robert Kenner's provocative, Oscar-nominated documentary &amp;#147;FOOD, INC.&amp;#148; explores the food industry's detrimental effects on our health and environment. The domination of our food supply by just a few corporations, the use of factory farming with the needs for pesticides and antibiotics, and finally the critical issue of the genetic engineering of our foods raise human, practical and ethical questions. Please join us. Tuesday, February 21 at 7 p.m. For more information, please contact Sam Baily at 978-255-1133 or go to www.amesburypeacecenter.org.
