&lt;p&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. If not, it's a one-time $20 membership fee that is good for a year. The Community Center is a walk away from the Orient Heights T Stop on the Blue Line and also has plenty of parking. When you drive up, turn at the Mariott Hotel Sign and park in the lot or further along the fence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Wing</member_name><member_id>3198724</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kory</member_name><member_id>8675200</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katya Starostina</member_name><member_id>20237091</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>11</waitlist_count><updated>1336324679000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335372238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intermediate Indoor Volleyball</name><id>62081922</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335913200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/62081922/</event_url></item>
