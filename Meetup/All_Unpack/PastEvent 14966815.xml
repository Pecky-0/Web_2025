(at the former location of the Marius.) There is of course the Irish wood work at the bar, a nice fireplace decor in the dinning room, and for those that want to get a full dinner you could get a table on the patio (weather permitting). The menu features a mix of a few old Irish favorites and more common American fare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drink Special Details are still a little Sketchy here's what I've been told:&lt;br /&gt;Name/Brand TBD, but &lt;b&gt;some of their drafts will be $2.50&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Name/Brand TBD, but there will be &lt;b&gt;a $3 bottle offered&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Type TBD, but there will be a $5 Martini offered.  &lt;br /&gt;Some Free nibbles will be put out in the bar area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I can't get more specific than that, but still could be good deals!  Hope to see you all tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AJ will host and can be reached at 315-345-9348. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about the Pub: &lt;br /&gt;www.kellysnewhaven.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.
