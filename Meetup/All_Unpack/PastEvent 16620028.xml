The show includes "prints by well-known artists, including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, and Walker Evans, . . . Charles Sheeler, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams&amp;mdash;along with work by highly inventive, but less well-known names." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/modernist-photography-1910-1950"&gt;http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/modernist-photography-1910-1950&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wednesday evenings after 4pm are pay what you choose (or free) nights. We'll meet at 6:30pm inside the lobby at the Hungtington Street entrance.&amp;nbsp; If you're later than about 10 minutes, find us in the "Conversations" exhibit. Since it's a "school" night, we probably won't go out afterwards. If anyone is interesting in gathering for an early dinner before, say so in your rsvp or send me an email. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Directions to the MFA: &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/visit/getting-here"&gt;http://www.mfa.org/visit/getting-here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
