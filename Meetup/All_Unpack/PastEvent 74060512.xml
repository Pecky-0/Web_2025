Please come with your stories of both success and woe, and a short description of what you did and didn't do this week with respect to procrastination or clutter. It seems to reduce the stress of life with procrastination and/or clutter to know you are not alone, and to be able to be of help to others as well as getting help and empathetic ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is enough interest, we'll consider having regular weekly meetings. So much easier to put on a calendar than the occasional monthly meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you on the 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
