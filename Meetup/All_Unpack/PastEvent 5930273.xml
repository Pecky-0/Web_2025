It's a 6 session agenda for 3 to 6 people. Take a look at the file section on the right and the PDF file &amp;quot;HSP Agenda&amp;quot;. Email me at munisuser@yahoo.com If you would like to start/join a group with session 1. We have had suggestions to meet in Newton Ctr., Framingham, and the Westwood Starbucks. Or suggest your own When 3 people agree to a location I'll put the meeting time/loc here.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183592401000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fiction Book Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>earon-90</urlname><id>443052</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>The first time book writers club for non-professionals</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182715776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Framingham Elaine Aron and Highly Sensitive Persons Meet Meetup</name><id>5930273</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183419000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/earon-90/events/5930273/</event_url></item>
