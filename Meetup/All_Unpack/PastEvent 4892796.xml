<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>What better way to spend Good Friday than a 4.3 mile hike following the ridge topography at this 800 acre State Park. The hike starts from the parking lot at the entrance to the park, going out just past Lake Louise to a lookout, then back via way of the Cedar Ridge Overlook, and to the parking lot (blue to white to yellow blazed trails). This is a lovely park that I visited briefly after the Talcott Mt. hike in March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area at the entrance (entrance is NEAR Penwood Rd, further west on Rte. 185) at 9 AM. There is no fee for parking. The hike is anticipated to take about 2.25 hours and should be done by about 11:15 AM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to have us stop at someplace to eat lunch after the hike so please plan accordingly. Some trailmix or some sort of hiking energy food as well as water for the hike might be advisable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penwood State Park map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/maps/penwood.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETS:&lt;br /&gt;Pets on a leash are permitted in picnic areas and on hiking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/penwood.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/penwood.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1144186557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Penwood SP in Bloomfield CT</name><id>4892796</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1145019600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4892796/</event_url></item>
