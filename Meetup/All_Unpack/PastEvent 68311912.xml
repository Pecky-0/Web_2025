&lt;p&gt;We connecting landholders who need a hand (or lack the interest) in working their outdoor spaces with neighbors who want to roll up their sleeves and start planting. Fit one of those categories? Sign up. Have you already started a garden, but now realize you need a helping hand? Look for it at our site. The site is 100% free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about yard sharing, want to meet potential people to yard share with or just want to say hi, stop by the Cambridge Library front lawn this Thursday. We'll be hanging out under a tree and enjoying the nice weather while discussing urban gardening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340325249000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Urban-Homesteaders-League</urlname><id>1466080</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Urban Homesteaders' League</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339165691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Garden with your neighbors through Yard Sharing.</name><id>68311912</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340317800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Urban-Homesteaders-League/events/68311912/</event_url></item>
