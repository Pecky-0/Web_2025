We might hedge some guesses about the size of our own souls - and perhaps throw in a few politicians.  Here's the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to shiny, bigger, better American consumerism comes a surreal comedy in which souls can be extracted and traded as commodities. Balancing on a tightrope between deadpan humor and pathos, and reality and fantasy, the film presents Paul Giamatti as himself, agonizing over his interpretation of Uncle Vanya. Paralyzed by anxiety, he stumbles upon a solution via a New Yorker article about a high-tech company promising to alleviate suffering by extracting souls. Giamatti enlists their service—only to discover that his soul is the shape and size of a chickpea. His intention is to reinstate it once he survives the performance but complications ensue when a mysterious, soul-trafficking “mule” borrows Giamatti's stored soul for an ambitious, but unfortunately talentless, Russian soap-opera actress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it's late notice, maybe isn't an option.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the front on the right after the movie.
