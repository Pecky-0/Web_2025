&lt;p&gt;They shut the road through the woods &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Seventy years ago.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Weather and rain have undone it again,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;And now you would never know&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;There was once a road through the woods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Before they planted the trees.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;It is underneath the coppice and heath,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;And the thin anemones.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Only the keeper sees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;That, where the ring-dove broods,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;And the badgers roll at ease,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;There was once a road through the woods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, if you enter the woods  &lt;br /&gt;

 Of a summer evening late,  &lt;br /&gt;

 When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools  &lt;br /&gt;

 Where the otter whistles his mate,  &lt;br /&gt;

 (They fear not men in the woods,  &lt;br /&gt;

 Because they see so few.)  &lt;br /&gt;

 You will hear the beat of a horse's feet,  &lt;br /&gt;

 And the swish of a skirt in the dew,  &lt;br /&gt;

 Steadily cantering through  &lt;br /&gt;

 The misty solitudes,  &lt;br /&gt;

 As though they perfectly knew  &lt;br /&gt;

 The old lost road through the woods. &lt;br /&gt;

 But there is no road through the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to be in a poetic mood. This link is to a musical rendition of Robert Frost's poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening. Caution this may give you chills if you sit quietly and listen to it. I find that the words in the choral are hard to understand if you don't know them so I've put the poem itself here below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whose woods these are I think I know.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;His house is in the village, though;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;He will not see me stopping here&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;To watch his woods fill up with snow.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;My little horse must think it queer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;To stop without a farmhouse near&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Between the woods and frozen lake&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;The darkest evening of the year.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;He gives his harness bells a shake&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;To ask if there is some mistake.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;The only other sound's the sweep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Of easy wind and downy flake.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;But I have promises to keep,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;And miles to go before I sleep,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;And miles to go before I sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of fun and lots of food and drink. RSVPs open 30 days prior to the event and these dinners fill up quickly. Remember there are no rules. Caryl will email the address to those attending the Wednesday before the dinner. Be sure to RSVP early as we always fill up quickly. Do RSVP though, especially if it gets you on the waiting list. Usually the waiting list people get to join us for dinner. Plan to cook on site, unless your recipe takes 45 minutes or more to prepare start to finish. Because the oven opens and closes often baked goods (excepting cookies) are best done ahead of time. Remember this isn’t just a potluck; this is about sharing the pleasure of cooking and food, and learning from one another while drinking wine 'n stuff and having great conversations. Bring what you'd like to drink plus a little to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send the address a few days before the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1342488439000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339217311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Through the Woods to The Farmers' Market</name><id>qxhmlcyqkbrb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342220400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/68418102/</event_url></item>
