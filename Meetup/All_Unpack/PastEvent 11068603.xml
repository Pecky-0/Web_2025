Biking should be faster than walking.&lt;/b&gt;  We've had people in their 20s to their 50s.  You don't have to be an Olympic athlete to join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;If it is raining OR there isn't much demand by Friday night â€“ I will reschedule for another day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be cross posting this with the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Bicycling/"&gt;Providence Bicycling meetup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/"&gt;Newport Friends meetup&lt;/a&gt;.  Please only sign up at one group's homepage - not both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at Fort Adam's parking lot.  &lt;u&gt;This ride will not be on dedicated paths, but on the road.  These roads are lightly traveled, but I highly suggest you wear a helmet.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us.  As usual, I will be sporting my signature red road bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To RSVP, go to &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Bicycling/calendar/11068603/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red road bike.
