<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>OK, lets try this again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's event will be held at India(for real this time&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;)? Their brunch is $13.95 for an all you can eat buffet.  Their menu and information can be found on their website &lt;a href="http://www.indiarestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I know Indian food is not everyone's &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; of brunch, but I figured lets give it a try.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event fills up, please RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; with a comment requesting to be wait listed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has not attended previous events, please plan on bringing a dollar to help me defray the cost of posting on meetup. For everyone who has attended, I only ask that you contribute every other event. This would be such a big help to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you there! Yay brunch!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See my piccy- I'm the one with the red hair ;-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222012260000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends who brunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Brunch-Bunch</urlname><id>964634</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch !</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214110997000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch- India Restaurant</name><id>8189268</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218987000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RI-Brunch-Bunch/events/8189268/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/7/f/global_4147919.jpeg</photo_url></item>
