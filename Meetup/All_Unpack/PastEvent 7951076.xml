I do that based on who might go and what i see in the store right before the event or what i want...LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i dont like to have a list of stuff for people to bring..&lt;br /&gt;So bring what you like and a bit more, everyone likes surprizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like to give the distance and time of the walk, even though i have been here before and when i was a kid many times.&lt;br /&gt;We will take our time and waite for the slow pokes but also to explore other features along the way..so no one is really a slow poke.....thats what i think this kind of walk should be anyway, enjoyment and discovery, not just looking at your feet to avoid tripping..stop for a moment...then return..and snort like piggs while eating so fast in some kind of restaurant smelling sweaty people , burping and farting, and that are talking about stuff you dont want to hear yet cant change seats at kind of event...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the destination, its lunch time and enjoy the surroundings, converse, and try some foods.&lt;br /&gt;then take our time going back, maybe variying the return path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long ?...its over when its over...thats how long...LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok Getting there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Hartford:&lt;br /&gt;take 91 south (if above Hartford) to 84 WEST, Cross the CT river bridge, get onto Rt 2 South, follow rt2 south till you see a sign for exit 7,&lt;br /&gt;Ok i dont remember the exact exit sign number, but its the exit for rte 17 south,&lt;br /&gt;take rt 17 south to its end where it meets Main Street..&lt;br /&gt;follow Main Street for apx 1.25 miles untill it intersects with Hopewell Rd on the left,&lt;br /&gt;Take a left onto Hopewell Rd for apx 1.2 miles and look for the intersection of Matson Hill Road, at this intersection is a swimming pool of to the right, pull into the pool parking lot, we will be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain cancels the event...but i will check in the morning and make a determination then..&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AL-r</member_name><member_id>2711041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211301487000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210949232000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sorry I dont have a Kayak event for today, But how about a walk ???</name><id>7951076</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211128200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/7951076/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/6/global_3541542.jpeg</photo_url></item>
