The 4th of July unfortunatley falls on a Wednesday this year so I thought let's have the party Tuesday July 3rd night instead, then we can party and stay up as late as we want and my kids will have moved out by then so I'll have a ton-o-extra space if you want or have to stay over, and we'll do brunch in the morning. Let me know if you want to bring something - a salad or dessert would be great but let me know on the comments section so I can plan my menu please. As usual there will be a vegetarian option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see a bunch of you come. This year, we better have more than 1 person in the pool (just sayin - thanks Gina you rock!). Bring yourbathings suits and towels. :) We can have a cannon ball contest, best belly flop contest - I'm sure I can think of a few fun pool games. We will have a fire is the fire pit and do smores.:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking logistics: There will now be parking in the front of my house. There is no parking on the side of my house (cranky neighbors). There is ample parking on the road and many people park in the Funeral home or CVS parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
