Here is the synopsis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly but aptly titled, Eat, Pray, Love is an experience to be savored: This spiritual memoir brims with humor, grace, and scorching honesty. After a messy divorce and other personal missteps, Elizabeth Gilbert confronts the &amp;quot;twin goons&amp;quot; of depression and loneliness by traveling to three countries that she intuited had something she was seeking. First, in Italy, she seeks to master the art of pleasure by indulging her senses. Then, in an Indian ashram, she learns the rigors and liberation of mind-exalting hours of meditation. Her final destination is Bali, where she achieves a precarious, yet precious equilibrium. Gilbert's original voice and unforced wit lend an unpretentious air to her expansive spiritual journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in September and I hope you enjoy the book!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have the entire room downstairs so you will know us when you come in!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224022865000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218586184000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club September Meetup</name><id>8531850</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221001200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/8531850/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/c/global_5139036.jpeg</photo_url></item>
