<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>OK I know that this is last minute but I really want to take advantage of the new snow and hit some glades and side country at Wildcat. Wildcat is about a 3 hour drive from Boston and just got 8&amp;quot; of snow. I will already be up north so you are on your own for transport. I will probably avoid the normal groomers and hit the woods as much as possible, if you can't ride in the woods we can still meet for lunch in the bar and do a few runs in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327160113000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327086751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wildcat Mountain</name><id>48923382</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327154400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/48923382/</event_url></item>
