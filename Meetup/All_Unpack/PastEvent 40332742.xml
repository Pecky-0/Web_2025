Actually you don&amp;#146;t really have to be an orphan, just someone who wants to hike and enjoy the company of other hikers on T-Day. A Thanksgiving Day buffet is optional at the AMC Pinkham Notch Visitors Center which is located three miles south of the trail head for Imp Trail. I plan on starting at nine a.m. which should finish us up at about one p.m. We can then drive down to the AMC Pinkham Notch Visitors Center for a two p.m. buffet dinner. If you decide to join us for dinner you will need to call the AMC Pinkham Notch Visitors Center reservation number at (603) 466-2727 and make a dinner reservation for two PM. Cost is $20.00 for AMC Members and $22.00 for non-members. You will need to call ASAP as the dinner attracts many hikers. Need something to lift your spirits on the holiday? The Imp Trail loop may be just what the doctor ordered. The view of the Presidential Peaks at the midpoint of this circuit is guaranteed to rekindle the ardor of any hiking enthusiast. This one is really special! Special attractions: Good exercise and an absolutely superlative view of the Presidential Peaks. This trail make a loop over the cliff that bears the same name, providing excellent views down through the valley and across the way to Mt. Washington. The complete loop is 6.3 miles with a book time of four hours. This will be a moderate hike. There is one short steep section before arriving at the top for a magnificent view. We will hike as a group and stay together. Directions to trailhead: Take Route 16 North past Joe Dodge Lodge and continue past the Mt. Washington Auto Road entrance. The northern Imp Trail is the second Imp Trail roadside parking area on the right. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322517634000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320706153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Imp Trail With Optional Dinner Buffet</name><id>40332742</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322143200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/40332742/</event_url></item>
