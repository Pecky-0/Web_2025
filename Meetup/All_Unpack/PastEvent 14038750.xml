Thanks for all of sharing of your experience and input. It was a great meeup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month we discuss about how to create the peace in the world though ourself first.  As an old saying: A thousand miles begins with one step. Everyday we face a lot of people, all of these relationship is a resources for us to create good energy. If we start sending out the peaceful energy to the world, this world will become much better.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all of your's sharing that we can do a lot of things from a little friendly smile to helping others. If we can transform our mindset, than everything around us could be very different. I am the one starting the peaceful energy and I am also the one stopping the vicious cycle. Even it is a tinny thing, but it may makes a huge different.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month, we are going to share and discuss more about what we can do for this world. How can we make this world more peaceful and how can I do in my daily life to change. Butterfly effect, every small step counts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to meet more friends with the same interest about seeking a spiritual life, please come and share your thoughts and experiences about how to practice spirituality in daily life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the day and letâ€™s create positive energy to the whole world. Hope see you all in our meetup.&lt;br /&gt;If weather is nice, we may can take a little walk after. Let's have some fun! &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The building will be second on the right when you coming to Condos, you may park any place with visitor parking sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jonathan</member_name><member_id>4981726</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279553167000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spirituality-149</urlname><id>670379</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5999984741</group_lon><name>The Westborough Spirituality Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278592644000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Westborough Spiritual July  Meetup</name><id>14038750</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279476000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spirituality-149/events/14038750/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/6/global_2055446.jpeg</photo_url></item>
