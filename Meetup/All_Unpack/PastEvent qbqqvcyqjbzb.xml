Should be able to play 5-1 and 6-2 formations, have a good grasp of skills (passing, setting, hitting) and be able to move around to cover areas of the court. Play should consistently be bump-set-spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location for this volleyball meetup is at the Orient Heights Community Center located at 86 Boardman Street in East Boston.  Katya will be hosting these Tuesday night volleyball meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. If not, it's a one-time $20 membership fee that is good for a year. The Community Center is a walk away from the Orient Heights T Stop on the Blue Line and also has plenty of parking. When you drive up, turn at the Mariott Hotel Sign and park in the lot or further along the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
