Why did they feel the need to travel across an ocean to find a new land to live their lives? And what was with those hats and those ridiculous shoe buckles? Will our newest book, The Wordy Shipmates by Sarah Vowell, give us those answers?  Honestly, beats me. I haven't read it yet! So, why don't you read the book, come to meeting, and explain it to me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at the Homestead Restaraunt in Londonderry this time. Kinda of an appropriate setting, I think. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, there's a 12 person cap, so sign up early. If you do sign up, but discover you can't make it, please update your RSVP asap so someone else can join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256944333000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254353332000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Are you a Wordy Shipmate?</name><id>11513147</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256770800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/11513147/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
