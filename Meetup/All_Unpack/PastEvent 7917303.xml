Therefore, I recently checked out some of the trails around Grater Road near Amherst, NH, during a dog walk in rainy weather. The trails I saw were winding through the woods; easy to ride and good for cruising along. Bob &amp;amp; Geri told me there are plenty more trails, such as wide fire roads, narrow rocky fire roads, single track, beaver ponds and damms, hills. So this will be kind of a expedition ride. I'll bring my GPS to make sure we won't get lost.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Grater Road is south of Baboosic Lake, off of Baboosic Lake Rd. Even though the road looks continguous on Google Maps, the meeting point can only be reached from the north. Meet at the parking lot ot the right of the "Gates ahead" (or so) sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211058156000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210523084000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grater Road Trails</name><id>7917303</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210885200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/7917303/</event_url></item>
