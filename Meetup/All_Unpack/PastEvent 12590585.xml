MOUNT EVEREST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Lei climbs Mount Everest, she will belong to an elite group of only 10 climbers in the world who have accomplished this feat!  In addition, she will be the first Chinese woman and the first Asian American woman to complete the &amp;quot;7+2&amp;quot; challenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: coral"&gt;Let's join Lei to show our support by meeting up at a party/fundraiser for her on February 26th.  Let's give her a proper &amp;quot;Fun with Alcohol&amp;quot; send off before she heads out to conquer Everest in March!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a $20.00 door charge, with proceeds going to help Lei with the cost of her trip.  Free food will be provided.  Listen to some great music, watch expedition photo exhibits, catch up with friends and enjoy a comedy show! Free salsa lessons and dancing after 9:00 PM if you stay.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look suspiciously like my photo!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>8876864</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267402412000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266004831000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Climb to the Top!"
