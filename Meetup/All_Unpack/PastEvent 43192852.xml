The purpose of this meeting is for the models to meet and get to know each other. We will talk about model issues and how we can help each other as a group. We will also offer training and tips for aspiring models, including how to find work, what to expect on your first assignment, etiquette, etc. This will be followed by a joint Artist-Models gathering where all participating models will have an opportunity to gain some experience modeling for a group of artist. We will ask for a $5 donation to cover cost of the venue.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>7904010</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326676150000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Art Models and Artists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NE-artists-models-group</urlname><id>408475</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>New England Artists/Models Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322862781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Models only meet and greet</name><id>43192852</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326562200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-artists-models-group/events/43192852/</event_url></item>
