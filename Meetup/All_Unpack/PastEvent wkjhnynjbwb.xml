We'll ride to Bedford and back to Arlington without stopping (except at crossroads), maintaining an average pace of 13 - 15 mph (depending on bike trail traffic). Total distance should be somewhere around 16 miles. The ride should take about 1.25 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a public parking lot off of Medford Street in Arlington Center. Parking is free there from 6PM on. We'll meet in this lot at 6:45PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helmets and water recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the public parking lot across from the Regent Theater at 6:45PM.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ilana</member_name><member_id>4194841</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277575697000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Leisure Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-235</urlname><id>527341</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Boston Leisure Bicycling</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270076877000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Night Minuteman Ride: Arlington to Bedford and Back</name><id>wkjhnynjbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276815600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-235/events/13052748/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/1/global_1549089.jpeg</photo_url></item>
