<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Julia has over a decade of professional experience as an energetic healer and intuitive coach. She uses her intuitive abilities to guide people into a deeper awareness of the forces shaping their lives, and then offers concrete tools for empowerment and growth. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be meeting at a very comfortable location in Dedham. The address will be given to people who have a Yes RSVP a couple of days before the event. Donations are voluntary. We will be giving Julia at least $100. If you can donate at least $10 then it will make our costs lower. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Feel free to bring snacks. There will be a couch, chairs and room to lie comfortably on the floor. This will be an interesting, educational, relaxing and exciting event!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331853968000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Walkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Evening-Walkers</urlname><id>865474</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Evening Walkers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326428700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Power of Intuition and How to Better Use It</name><id>47915722</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1331337600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Evening-Walkers/events/47915722/</event_url></item>
