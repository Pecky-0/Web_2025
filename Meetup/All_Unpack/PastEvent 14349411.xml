<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>My husband and I have been making vegan icecreams and sorbets since we went vegan in 2007.  We would love to have everyone over to our house in Concord on a Sunday afternoon for vegan &amp;quot;ice cream&amp;quot; and treats!  Debrah's Natural Gourmet is having a sale on some vegan icecreams during the month of August so it would be easy for people to swing by and pick up their favorite flavor on their way over.  We promise to make flavors like persian ice cream or lavendar ice cream - not sold in stores but super yummy.  Our favorite base involves coconut milk and agave nectar.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dushenka</member_name><member_id>5569658</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283187958000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281197271000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vegan Ice cream Social</name><id>14349411</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283104800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/14349411/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_7118529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
