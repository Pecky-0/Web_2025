 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Borderland State Park has over 20 miles of hiking trails, including a section of the Bay Circuit Trail. There are no less than six ponds to explore. Visitors enjoy the easy three mile pond loop trail which is made up of old farm roads and paths through hay fields. The other park trails range from moderate to difficult hiking. The distances and difficulty are labeled on the trail map.  The park is open daily year round from 8am to sunset.  The park also has Disc Golf, a good size field for throwing a football or frisbee and a picnic area.  Visitors may also decide to take in the outside of the historical Ames Mansion and its grounds at the park.  Borderland is in a very residential area and the closest restaurants are in Sharon Center which has limited options. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 What to Bring/Wear: Comfortable walking clothes, Comfortable yet supportive walking/hiking sneakers/shoes, and Water &lt;br /&gt;

 Optional: Bug Spray (highly recommended), Sunscreen, Hat/Visor, Sunglasses, Snack &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please Note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Due to the limited number of spaces available between both groups, please RSVP Yes only if you are 99% sure you will attend.  As such, once you know you are no longer able to attend please change your RSVP from Yes to No so that someone else may have the opportunity to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
