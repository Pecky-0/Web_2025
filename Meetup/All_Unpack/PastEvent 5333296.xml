<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For all those at a loose end on Xmas eve we will be having dinner and drinks at Matt Murphy's pub in Brookline Village.  This cozy little pub has an excellent menu and plenty of tasty beverages to soothe a festive thirst, those of you who have been here before will know exactly what I mean.  This location is very easy to get to, only a couple of minutes walk from the Brookline Village stop on the Green D line.  I hope to see you all there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all those that can't make it, I hope you have a happy and safe Xmas.  I look forward to catching up with you all again in 2007 for some more Aussie meetups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1167177747000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166405496000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The night before Christmas at Matt Murphy's</name><id>5333296</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1167004800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/5333296/</event_url></item>
