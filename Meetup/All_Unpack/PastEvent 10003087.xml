Per Goddard, a very effective tactic to sway Laske would be to flyer her constituents and donors with anti-seatbelt [law] literature thereby alerting Laske to the organized opposition and the unpopularity of the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here’s the deal:&lt;br /&gt;1.       I have the flyers and the maps and addresses/neighborhoods we need to hit&lt;br /&gt;2.       I can pick people up, and give rides to and from the locations as necessary&lt;br /&gt;          a.       Hopefully we’ll have 2-3 cars and can hit different neighborhoods simultaneously&lt;br /&gt;3.       I’m shooting for about 3-4 hours on Sunday afternoon&lt;br /&gt;          a.       This depends of course on how many volunteers I can round up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Brett Powell&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg Surbey</member_name><member_id>3479382</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238949166000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237655725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHLA Pro Seat Belt Freedom Flyer Drop</name><id>10003087</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237748400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/10003087/</event_url></item>
