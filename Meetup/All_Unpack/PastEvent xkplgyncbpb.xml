We also discussed the upcoming antiwar conference sponsored by New England United and the need to spread the word. We voted to reject the notion that Rightists could impose their politics and agenda on the upcoming conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmakers in Washington continue to escalate the war against Afghanistan and participate in the blockade against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.  The new year confronts us with these challenges as well as others and it is up to us all to rise to the occasion and confront the war machine as we have in the past. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Schaich</member_name><member_id>4406518</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Andrews</member_name><member_id>5009779</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Harris</member_name><member_id>5188497</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suren Moodliar</member_name><member_id>5714882</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263425659000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People for Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>stopthewars</urlname><id>708558</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Antiwar</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260231057000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Antiwar Meetup</name><id>xkplgyncbpb</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263252600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/stopthewars/events/12039583/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/d/b/global_6761595.jpeg</photo_url></item>
