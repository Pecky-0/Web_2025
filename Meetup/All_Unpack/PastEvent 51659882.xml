The Museum of Fine Arts is presenting a Studio Ghibli film series this month. This is your chance to see some of Miyazaki's old classics on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nausicaa; of the Valley of the Wind" by Hayao Miyazaki is considered by many to be his masterwork. Set in a future world decimated by atmospheric poisons and gigantic insects, the film is is the story of the young princess Nausicaa, both brave and innocent, whose love for all living things and passionate determination to understand the processes of nature lead her into terrible danger, sacrifice, and eventual triumph. The film is in Japanese with English subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film starts at 7:45 so let's meet at 7:00 to purchase tix together. Tix are $9 for students, $11 general admission. We'll meet in the lobby at the &lt;strong&gt;HUNTINGTON&amp;nbsp;AVE&lt;/strong&gt; entrance near the ticket lines and gift shop (Museum of Fine Arts T stop on the Green line E branch). We can grab a bite to eat around the area afterwards. &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/programs/film/nausica%C3%A4-valley-wind" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mfa.org/pr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rosie</member_name><member_id>14232825</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329630023000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328764923000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind @ MFA</name><id>51659882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329523200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/51659882/</event_url></item>
