NY Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Russian matriarch visits her grandson, a soldier, at his desolate camp somewhere in Chechnya. Not much happens during her stay - she interacts with the young recruits and makes friends with a Chechen woman. But in the hands of visionary filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, this simple material makes for a haunting drama about war, generational relationships and the human condition. SF Chronicle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexander Sokurov has been one of Russia's top directors for the past 20 years, best known in this country for the films &lt;b&gt;The Russian Ark&lt;/b&gt;  and &lt;b&gt;Mother and Son&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Alexandra&lt;/b&gt; may be his finest work to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spare yet tactile, a mysterious mixture of lightness and gravity.
