Or why your baby is crying? The Baby Signs® Program teaches babies to use simple, easy-to-do gestures for communicating with their parents and caregivers. These gestures or “signs” represent an item or concept, like “cat,” “eat,” or “all gone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using signs gives babies a way to &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; with their parents, before they can talk. Babies can communicate about the world around them, long before they have mastered their verbal speaking skills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Babies and toddlers often use signs as a natural part of the communication process. Many babies know how to wave &amp;quot;bye-bye&amp;quot; or use a headshake to mean &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot; The Baby Signs® Program can help your baby use lots of other gestures to communicate just as easily as these more common &amp;quot;signs.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the theme for each class:&lt;br /&gt;March 6:    Mealtime&lt;br /&gt;March 13:  Bedtime&lt;br /&gt;March 20:  Bath Time&lt;br /&gt;March 27:  Getting Dressed&lt;br /&gt;April 10:    Pets&lt;br /&gt;April 17:    At the Park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each class you will learn about 6 to 7 signs, so you will learn about 37 signs if you take all 6 classes!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula Penna</member_name><member_id>8325760</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268665749000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1316784</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Greater Hartford Area  Parents Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264658299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign, Say, and Play (BabySigns) Class Week 2: Bedtime Signs</name><id>12447254</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268492400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group/events/12447254/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/7/global_12830887.jpeg</photo_url></item>
