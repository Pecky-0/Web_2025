We’ll follow a gravel path to the summit of Case Mountain for the well-known view of Manchester’s Downtown and the Hartford skyline. Although this is the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; route, it's still a moderately steep hike of about one and a half hours all together. Best for hikers ages 5 and up. Uneven ground and some steep areas. &lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot very close to the intersection of Birch Mountain and Camp Meeting Roads, Manchester. If coming from Hartford, take I-84 to I-384. At exit 4, take a left onto Spring Street, and a right onto Highland Street (which becomes Camp Meeting Road). In about one-half mile, take a right onto Birch Mountain Road, where the lot is almost immediately on the right. If coming from Providence, take I-384, exit 4, and turn right onto Highland Street. In about seven-tenths of a mile, turn right onto Birch Mountain Road, where the lot is on the right. &lt;br /&gt;No dogs please, because we are also inviting CT Forest &amp;amp; Park family hike program members. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a blue backpack.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>31</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222735510000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216750287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy Case Mountain hike </name><id>8389896</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220115600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/8389896/</event_url></item>
