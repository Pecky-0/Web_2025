The Colonial Inn is in the center of town. Large municipal parking lots are behind the stores (free) on Main Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENE: One of New England's quaintest, most historic hotels. There are numerous sofas and chairs and, in the tavern, tables, on which to sketch (not paint). You can order a drink for the lobby or food in the tavern or restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: This is more of a travel session, so please pack light, ideally nothing more than a 9x12 sketchbook. Dry media is strongly preferred, unless you are accustomed to working with brush in small settings. Also, expect that we will converse while we sketch, unlike most BPAAG meet-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call me. Save the number below (I myself always forget to do that, then I get there, and I'm clueless what the number was :) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269972897000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266764633000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDOOR SKETCH GET-TOGETHER: Colonial Inn, Concord</name><id>12662535</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269799200000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/12662535/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/b/global_12503659.jpeg</photo_url></item>
