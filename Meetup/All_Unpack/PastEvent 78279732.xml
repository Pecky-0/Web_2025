 &lt;br /&gt;

 SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues. We create social spaces that allow for the possibility of cross-issue connections and run a Skillshare Series, hosted by The NonProfit Center*, which increases our individual capacity for movement building. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 6:00-6:30 Socializing - bring your own dinner (microwave and water cooler available) &lt;br /&gt;

 6:30-8:30 Training and Q &amp;amp; A &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Effective Volunteer Engagement&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 How do we attract and engage motivated volunteers who will further our charitable work? We will consider motivation, from the benefits of volunteering, to our needs and the effort required to manage/support volunteers. No prior knowledge expected - we'll start with fundamentals. Participants will come away with a position description template and strategic approaches for customized volunteer recruitment and engagement. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 2000 members and almost 6 years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (130+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
