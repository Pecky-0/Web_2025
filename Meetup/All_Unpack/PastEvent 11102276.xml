Smart causal attire, jeans OK, and $10 admission. Dancers can bring your favorite music Cd's and we will play some special requests. Beginner dance lesson with a guest dance instructor. Parking is available around the Salem Common and in the rear lot of the building. There is room for many and bring lots of your friends. Don't miss out of this great night of dance fun.
