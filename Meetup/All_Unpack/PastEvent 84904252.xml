Anyone looking for something to do on October 6th?? All for a good cause...Sunshine Kids.. an organization that helps kids with cancer while going thru treatments, helps them feel like kids, going to ball games , broadways shows...etc. It is a worthy cause I have been involved with this fundraiser for the last 7 years, so for $40.00 you can have dinner ,dessert, a great band all night , The Rumrunners and great raffles. Please call for tix or just to make a donation Thanks all who already have!!! &lt;br /&gt;

THIS IS GOING TO BE AT THE PAUGUSSET CLUB IN ORANGE 1 CLUB ROAD &lt;br /&gt;

RIGHT NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF RACEBROOK RD. AND RT. 34 &lt;br /&gt;

THIS IS A BYOB EVENT – TIME: 7:00 TO 11:00 PM &lt;br /&gt;

IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET A TABLE TOGETHER TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT FOR SUCH A WORTH WHILE ORGANIZATION. &lt;br /&gt;
