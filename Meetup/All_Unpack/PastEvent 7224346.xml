<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hey everyone! We are ready to host another game night, but this time as newlyweds! We are hoping for an early spring so that these meetups can begin outside with a barbecue:) Please come to our house, bring any games that you would like to play, since we do have more two player games in this household than group games. We will probably break into smaller games, including some cards and then meet back up for one large game. Hope to see new and old faces! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this house has two cats, which we will keep separate upstairs. Also, feel free to bring a snack and drink, but most important bring yourself! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian &amp;amp; Brittany&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring the TOP bell and we will greet you with a smile:)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206809393000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><why>You'll love it because everyone needs a laugh and this event is sure to bring some.</why><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201654388000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hoping for an Early Spring</name><id>7224346</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205622000000</time><rsvp_limit>19</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7224346/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/8/9/global_3094489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
