&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please join us at the Capitol on Tuesday, May 21st, from 11a-1p as we stand together to demand our right to know what is in our food. Please meet on the north side of the Capitol building (the side facing Bushnell Park) at 11:00am. We will join together to send a strong message to our legislators that we want the right to know what is in our food now. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 After the rally, we will b&lt;/span&gt;e joined by legislators for a GMO free food tasting. There will be delicious food thanks to our generous CT farms, chefs and businesses (we will publish the list once it is complete). This is also a perfect opportunity to meet legislators face to face and ask them to support HB 6519 and HB 6527. We will provide you with handouts. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We need you to be there and to bring your friends. Please share this on facebook, twitter and forward to your contacts. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Thank you for all you are doing to ensure that GMO labeling in CT will become a reality. &lt;br /&gt;
