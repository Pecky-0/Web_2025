He will be in our town for one day only, and will be giving this seminar at the Center of Light on Orange Street. The description is below. If the topics of reincarnation or mysticism interest you at all, or if you're just curious what a Christian priest is doing talking about reincarnation, then you are welcome to join us for what is sure to be a very interesting evening.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;FROM LIFE TO LIFE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Christian religions teach that we have but one life and that human beings are endowed with an immortal spirit which will last beyond that one life, sent to either an eternal &amp;quot;Heaven&amp;quot; or an eternal &amp;quot;Hell.&amp;quot; In contrast, as Christian Mystics, we teach the Cosmic Law of Rebirth. This Law states that we learn the lessons of existence in the material world, in one lifetime after another. If we do not master conditions in one lifetime, we simply repeat the lessons in the next lifetime, until they are mastered. In time, over many lives, every one of us will develop our divine potential. Join us in a discussion of this Cosmic Law and how it relates to your current life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seminar is being given by Father Peter Bowes. Father Peter is the Co-Founder and Director of the Order of Christ Sophia, a Master Teacher, and an ordained Priest. Every week of the year, he travels nationally to give lectures and seminars on the Christian mystical inner path. Father Peter is also an author, he has written and published three books entitled The Word Within, Spiritual Astrology, and The Radical Path..&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
