&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup/members/4425248/"&gt;BERT LEVINE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has opened up his beautiful house in Westport&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Our theme is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CALIFORNIA DREAMING" so all wines should be from our lovely sunshine state California :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again we will have a appetizer competition - who ever brings the&amp;nbsp;most delicious&amp;nbsp;mouth watering morsel will win&amp;nbsp;a bottle of wine - with our theme being California lets make it a Cal&amp;nbsp;Mexican food theme. No need to bring wine glasses Bert has plenty. Lets enjoy a evening under the star's and toast to the sunny days of summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine or 1.75MLs please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvre or desert. Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up. If you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more ( 750 ml) with your dish. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste. Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reds - Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, shiraz pinot noir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whites - sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence. It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly. I will have water and coffee too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We e-mail the Address closer to the date to those who have signed up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise Brown</member_name><member_id>10321540</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1311724348000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Winos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup</urlname><id>593834</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven  Wine and Dining  Meetup Group,</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>62</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308853206000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"MID SUMMERS NIGHT DREAM" Wine Party "Cheers"</name><id>23272811</id><headcount>62</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1311458400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup/events/23272811/</event_url></item>
