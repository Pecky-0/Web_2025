It traces the route William Dawes rode on the night of April 18, 1775 from Boston to Lexington to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that the regulars were marching from Boston. (That other guy, Paul Revere, went a different way.) It starts at the location of Joseph Warren's home/office which is now buried beneath Government Center and travels through Boston, Roxbury, Brookline, Brighton, Allston, Cambridge, Arlington and Lexington before arriving at the historic Clarke-Hancock House. Along the 18 mile jaunt we talk about historic buildings, sites and the events of that fateful night.&lt;br /&gt;Nuts you say? That's why I&amp;quot;M leading it. We meet at the Government Center T station at 9:00pm on the night of April 18th, start out at 9:30pm just as Dawes did, and arrive in Lexington just about midnight which is also when he arrived. If you are interested or have questions, you can contact me at Michael&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;AfHB&amp;quot;dot&amp;quot;org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike McHugh AIA, LEED AP&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the T stop entrance looking like I'm ready to run.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael McHugh</member_name><member_id>1987659</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271814171000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266125366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>William Dawes Adventure Run</name><id>12600384</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271640600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/12600384/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/4/global_2338596.jpeg</photo_url></item>
