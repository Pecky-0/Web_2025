Brown's longtime editor, Jason Kaufman, Vice President and Executive Editor at Doubleday said, &amp;quot;Nothing ever is as it first appears in a Dan Brown novel. This book's narrative takes place in a twelve-hour period, and from the first page, Dan's readers will feel the thrill of discovery as they follow Robert Langdon through a masterful and unexpected new landscape. The Lost Symbol is full of surprises.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the table closest to the cafe door.
