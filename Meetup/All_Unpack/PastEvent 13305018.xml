I would like to do this again and figured I this would be a good time, as I am also scheduling a trip on May  8th to head to Mohegan, if you want to see it and try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not good at craps, so I cant teach that, but am willing to teach blackjack(along with its &amp;quot;match the dealer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in between&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;spanish 21&amp;quot; variations), pai gow poker, sic bo, texas holdem, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to see if I can borrow a dealer friend for the night. If we rent his services, there will be a small charge for the evening to cover his tips and services. But if he cant, I will charge the usual voluntary $1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am inviting Boston Cards and conversation to this meet-up as well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273273456000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272376090000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NYRGN (Not Your Regular Game Night) - Casino Games!
