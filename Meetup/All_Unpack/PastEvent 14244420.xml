What is emerging next in theory, practice and application?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might say that Zak and Clint live in different worlds. Zak's from Harvard, where he's pioneering standardized testing reform through the injection of rigorous developmental assessments into the mainstream world, whereas Clint hails from the hallowed and oftentimes messy realm of Wilber's Integral Institute, where together with a group of what Zak calls &amp;quot;radical educationists,&amp;quot; he's inventing cutting-edge practices founded upon confusingly advanced theory.  These seeming differences are merely surface features, floating atop a friendship and collaboration that intersects and overlaps in profound and exciting ways.  This evening dialogue - focused on the &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; questions held in common by members of the integral and evolutionary communities - promises to be filled with diverse perspectives, radical visions, and the interplay of two heart/minds walking this path together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zak Stein&lt;/b&gt; received a BA in philosophy from Hampshire College in 2004 and an Ed.M. in Mind, Brain, and Education from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education in 2006. Currently, He is a student of philosophy and cognitive development pursing a doctorate at Harvard. He is also the Deputy Director for the Developmental Testing Service, where he has worked for years employing cognitive developmental models and metrics in a variety of real world contexts.  He holds the position of adjunct faculty in the Integral Theory Department at John F. Kennedy University, where he teaches a class on vision-logic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clint Fuhs&lt;/b&gt; is a leading authority in the field of Integral Theory and Practice and has been a senior student of its progenitor, Ken Wilber, for the past 7 years. Clint served in several leadership positions in the areas of operations and curriculum at Integral Institute and Integral Life since 2003. Currently, he is the CEO of Core Integral, Inc., which he founded with Ken in early 2009 as a platform to develop a comprehensive professional training and certification program, aiming to expand the accessibility and ensure the integrity of the Integral approach. Clint currently serves as adjunct faculty in the Integral Studies programs at both JFK University and Fielding Graduate University, and is completing a PhD in Human and Organizational Systems at Fielding.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECIAL NOTE: The early bird special for this meetup is $25.
