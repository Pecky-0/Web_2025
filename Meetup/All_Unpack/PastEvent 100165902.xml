<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, it's not the matchup a lot of us were hoping for...but it should still be a great game. There's a watch party being thrown by some local promoters so that is where we will be heading. I'm assuming that the place will get packed around 6:30 so I recommend getting there early. I will try to secure a table for us around 5:45 - no guarantees. Street parking will be free as it's Sunday. The venue is by the Harvard Sq. red line stop. Use mbta.com or google maps if you need directions. I've copied the event description below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
