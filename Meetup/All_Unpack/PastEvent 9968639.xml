When we can begin to see things as they are, including the commentary from our conditioned thinking, we can experience the judging mind that keeps us in a place of non-acceptance. Otherwise known as equanimity, or seeing all things equally, non-judgment gives us a way to meet the world, and be with others, in a way that inspires presence and greater acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us for our weekly gathering. The meeting will include several shorter meditations (15-20 minutes each) and discussion. All levels are welcome, please join us on Monday evening for mindful community.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people at the door until 6pm</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240268702000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237245111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup- Non-Judgment</name><id>9968639</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239660000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9968639/</event_url></item>
