Come on out for some BBQ, relaxation, and fun times as we start our Labor Day weekend!  Firefly's has a wide variety of food to choose from, even if you are not a BBQ fan.  There's a lot of food options for sharing.  Firefly's has been mentioned among the Org Team a few times and this is the perfect opportunity for us to try this restaurant for the first time as a group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price Ranges are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;Apps: $5-$20 &lt;br /&gt;Salads: $5-$16&lt;br /&gt;Entrees: $12-$20&lt;br /&gt;Sandwiches: $6-$10&lt;br /&gt;Sides: $2.99/ea or 3 for $8&lt;br /&gt;Dessert: $2.50-$6.49&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great opportunity to meet and get to know each other, as well as talk about different foods, restaurants, and meals we enjoy.  This will also be a great time to plan future Dining Out events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring cash.  You are responsible for your portion of the meal, including but not limited to, your drinks, food, tax, and tip and any shared items.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday Night Dinner&lt;br /&gt;Firefly's BBQ&lt;br /&gt;516 Adams Street&lt;br /&gt;Quincy, MA 02169&lt;br /&gt;617-471-0011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fireflysbbq.com/Quincy.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fireflysbb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Location: &lt;i&gt;Outside the front door if it's nice out.
