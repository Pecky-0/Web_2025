It is a great spot to practice day game as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips, tan a little bit before this day. The last thing you need is for this to be the first day out in the sun and you are pale white. Come out expecting to have fun, bring food and drinks with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get ready to have fun to prepare for that night's big event - part 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the last event of May. After this, members' participation will be evaluated. This will be the last opportunity to participate as a part of the Wingmen.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Know what I look like and call the cell - (203) 410 6861</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242104616000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday - May 30th - Part 1 - Misquamicut Beach</name><id>10392105</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243695600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10392105/</event_url></item>
