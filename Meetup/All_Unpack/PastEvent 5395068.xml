THE NEXT MEETUP IS STILL IN APRIL!  THIS WAS JUST AN INADVERTANT ERROR CAUSED BY THE MEETUP STAFF WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO PUT ME BACK INTO THE ACCOUNT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PUG MEETUP ORGANIZER!  &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Creeley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December's meetup will be back at King Clovis's backyard.   With all those people, we're short on folding chairs (very short!), so if you have one, please remember to bring it!  John and Cindy and Zoey are bringing the food, King Clovis is hosting, and Hammer is looking forward to entertaining in the kitchen (drop something, PLEASE drop something).  We look forward to seeing everyone!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the last meetup of 2006.  If it rains or snows, the meetup will be cancelled rather than postponed, and we will see all of our friends again in warmer weather!  (March or April?)  Thanks to everyone for making the first year of the South of Boston Pug Meetup such a fun year!   Let's hope for one more party this year, and everyone pray for a warm, bright day for that second Sunday in December!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST MONTH'S MEETUP...&lt;br /&gt;The November meetup was our biggest meetup ever, with 27 people and at least 30 Pugs (and two Frenchies and a Poodlely dog) in attendance, despite the typical late autumn weather - damp and cold and overcast.  That never stopped the Pugs, they had a grand time running around - it's never a bad day if you're a Pug! - and we welcomed several new dogs and their families - Tank and Chester and Duke and Porky.  11 week old Otis made his first appearance, warmly dressed in a red woolly sweater.  He had a grand time, and why not?  He had so many admirers his feet never touched the ground!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buford, Millie, and Max celebrated their birthdays with party hats (which we forgot to put on the dogs!), delicious liver Bow-wow-Nies, and doggie treat bags for the guests.  Those liver brownies were so soft that even Clovis managed to eat his share without any trouble.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another fun day was had by all, and we were please to see new faces.  If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have!  If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend.  Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it because of all the fun that we (Pugs and people alike) have!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540905000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168862863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug February Meetup</name><id>5395068</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171220400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5395068/</event_url></item>
