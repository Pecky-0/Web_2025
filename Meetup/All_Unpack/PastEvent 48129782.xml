Their album is currently streaming on their site, though they're playing it once over the span of 4 months, so it's playing very, very slowly. There's a nice note playing right now. Anyways, real-time tracks I recommend to check out are Lovesick Teenagers, You Do You, and Fake Out, as well as a new one, The Reflection of You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's meet at 7:30 at Tavern on the Square on Brighton Ave (it's right across the street from the venue). We'll head over to the Brighton Music Hall after 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening acts are Blouse and Doldrums. Doors at 8 PM; Show at 9 PM; 18+ Show Advance Box Office Price $12&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael</member_name><member_id>3431633</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336261695000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326587637000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bear in Heaven</name><id>48129782</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336089600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/48129782/</event_url></item>
