It has been proven that there is definitely a dramatic difference in income and profitability when individuals pay attention to the details, build a solid foundation for their business and run their business as a business. Today, the challenges are even greater as we shift into a virtual world that changes the way we communicate, market and sell.  Those of us who do not adapt and leverage the &amp;quot;new economy&amp;quot;  will definitely see their business shrink further as they will be overlooked and replaced by those solo's who face and embrace change. This  shift also presents tremendous opportunities for growth and profitability for solos who take advantage of those &amp;quot;shifting winds of change&amp;quot;. Q&amp;amp;A will follow the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deborah J. Polydys, the owner and founder of Strategic Management Resources LLC (SMR), a business advisory firm specializing in working with entrepreneurs &amp;amp; solopreneurs since 1985, will lead the discussion.
