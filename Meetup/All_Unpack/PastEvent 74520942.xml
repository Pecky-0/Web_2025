&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total ride is 16 miles. About 24  miles, if you want to do the Cranston Section too.  It offers nice scenery and water views, complete with waterfalls. It is an interesting path, in that you are riding slightly uphill all the way out.  It is not much, but you will notice you get back Quicker and easier.  If there is time left, those who want, can head toward Cranston. I plan to ride for about another  4 miles, then do a little Road Riding, on some Side Streets, in Cranston. The entire path is actually 32 miles round trip, but I like to start in the middle so no one feels pressured to ride more than they are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually like to split into a Few  Groups, so No One feels Pressured to Ride Faster than they are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Route 295 South to exit #2, Route 2 South. Take a Right at the Light with the Dunkin Doughnuts and the Parking Lot is , 1/4 mile down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or Route 95 South to exit 12B, the exit splits stay LEFT Route 113 West. 1/2 Mile you will see the Dunkin Doughnuts, keep going straight thru the Light. The Parking Lot is 1/4 mile Down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming 95 North, get on Route 295 North and take I believe the first exit. It is either Route 2 South or Route 113 West.  All I know is that there is no Exit 12 on Route 95 heading North and you need to take Route 295 North&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know how to Follow directions or Read a Map, LOL, Enter 700 East Ave Warwick R I in your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
