This is a flat water to quick water paddle through some beautiful scenery. The meandering river takes you through parts of Exeter, Richmond and Hopkington. Blue herons, egrets and water mammals can be seen on this 5 hour jaunt with a break for lunch. Bring your own boat or rent at Hope Valley Bait &amp;amp; Tackle. Daily boat rentals are $37 for either a one person kayak or two person canoe. I think it's $55 for a two person kayak.  It's worth it. Very relaxing ride with maybe one portage. For you adrenalin junkies there's a little white water at a broken down dam. Test your skill! All others will portage around the obstacle. &amp;quot;Cliff notes&amp;quot; boat handling lesson for those who want it. Bring lunch, hat, sunscreen, camera and your sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Take exit 3A off of Route 95 to Ocean State Job Lot (behind McDonalds)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dennis </member_name><member_id>8755592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253973494000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252465521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle to Paradise</name><id>11324760</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253365200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11324760/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/d/global_10616077.jpeg</photo_url></item>
