Aaron has been a long-time member of the group, ever so generous with time, knowledge, plants, seeds and space.  Any time you can contribute to the cause would be great, plus you will learn a bit about some cool techniques in the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aaron writes:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;We are building our house out of a mix of alternative, conventional and salvage material. The walls and  foundation are being built out of Durisol ICF (insulating concrete forms) blocks, this will create a super-insulated and very strong wall with many other advantages. We are doing all the work ourselves, with help from friends whenever we can get it. The work will probably center around laying ICF blocks as well as cutting, bending and tying rebar... although there will be other misc.  things to do as well.  Before getting going on work i would be happy to show people around my place and discuss the advantages/disadvantages of ICF buildings.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:00 am to 12:30 or 1:00 pm (coffee, tea, AM snacks provided) followed by a potluck lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear work clothes/shoes and bring work gloves.  Bring a camera if you want to capture some of the details.  Bring a potluck lunch dish to share and your potluck kit (plate/bowls/utensils/cup/napkin).  In the event of rain check the comments area for this event and Aaron will post a rain date if needed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248392322000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244822006000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Work Party:  Green/Alternative Building in Action</name><id>10637600</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248008400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/10637600/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/6/c/global_9106972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
