<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will be hiking Mt. Moosilauke and the South Peak by going up the Gorge Brook across the Carriage Road and down the Snapper Trail  The total distance is 7.5 miles and the book time is approximately 5:00.  This will be a great hike for experienced hikers and anyone that does not have alot of experience hiking.  We will be going at an average pace and will plan on spending an hour or so on Mt. Moosilauke and half an hour to 45 minutes on the South Peak.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Moosilauke offers fantistic views and is one of my favorite hikes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dartmouth Ravine Lodge is located on a short dirt road off of Route 118 between Warren and North Woodstock New Hampshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, or I can provide any additional information, please feel free to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>WE WILL MEET IN THE FIELD BEHIND THE DARTMOUTH RAVINE LODGE</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218664854000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217335811000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MT MOOSILAUKE AND SOUTH PEAK </name><id>8433983</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218375000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8433983/</event_url></item>
