We will lap swim the great War Memorial Pool Wednesday nights for a few weeks. I will give some free swim lessons from the side of the pool. Most people greatly improve their freestyle with just a few tips. Or you can just swim for fun and let others take my very informal class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details: We will swim from 7:00 to 8:30 PM. The War Memorial is walking distance from Harvard Sq. The pool is part of the Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School. Parking is difficult but it is possible to find street parking at a meter. The pool costs $5.50. Please bring a regulation (normal) swim suite and a towel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the swim I will be in the gym upstairs lifting weights. Feel free to join me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't find me ask the lifeguard where I am. (Ask for Geoff) I'm likely in the water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you have any questions (I don't always answer my emails because my mail box is crammed.) 617 501-6217. Geoff &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's have fun!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the gym at 6:30 on the Treadmill.
