This is the first weekend day I am free.  Instead of meeting at the oval where everyone else meets, we'll meet across from the Community Boating Center.  If you take the Redline to Charles/MGH and walk over the footbridge it's right at the bottom of the stairs.  If you are coming a different way, it's behind the Hatch Shell and before the bridge the Redline crosses to Cambridge.  You can see the Center in the picture above.  There's one covered bench across from the Center and it's next to a stone water bubbler.  Here's a link to the Center's directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.community-boating.org/directions.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.community-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course bad weather cancels.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In front of Community Boating, sitting on covered bench next to water bubbler.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dee</member_name><member_id>4101956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214233565000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Good exercise</why><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212332870000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Morning Esplanade skate</name><id>8053815</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214060400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/8053815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/b/global_4311867.jpeg</photo_url></item>
