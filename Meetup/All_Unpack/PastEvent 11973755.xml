(Or come the day before the cleaning!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Share what you think about Obama’s performance in Copenhagen for the climate change talks, or what your plans are for your holiday. No agenda except Fun!  However, if you are interested in learning more about what we're doing and how you can help, we’ll be ready to talk about that too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being part of our meet-ups this past year and supporting the environment and the Sierra Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Winter Weather Plan- in the absence of an advisory from the Governor that no one should leave his/her house, if the subway is running, we'll be there enjoying ourselves. We hope you'll come too!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary Ann!</member_name><member_id>618637</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mass Sierra</member_name><member_id>3278292</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260567280000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Environmental Activists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Sierra-Club</urlname><id>229402</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Sierra Club Environmental Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259516959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Office Open House</name><id>11973755</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260394200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Sierra-Club/events/11973755/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/3/global_7614675.jpeg</photo_url></item>
