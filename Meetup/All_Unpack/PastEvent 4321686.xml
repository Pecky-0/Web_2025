The discussion will be based on who these great minds where and their ideas. Now most of these very old thoughts have been proven wrong due to the fact of advancing technology but to know what philosophy is today means knowing what is was when it started out. We will be examining the individuals that inspired Plato, Pyrrho, and the Stoics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also helps the beginner with the history of philosophy but note this is not meant to be a class lecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The First Philosophers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thales&lt;br /&gt;Anaximander&lt;br /&gt;Anaximenes&lt;br /&gt;Heraclitus&lt;br /&gt;Pythagoras&lt;br /&gt;Xenophanes&lt;br /&gt;Parmenides&lt;br /&gt;Empedocles&lt;br /&gt;Leucippus&lt;br /&gt;Anaxagoras&lt;br /&gt;Protagoras&lt;br /&gt;Zeno of Elea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note there will be a some whta brief but some what detailed outline on these guys on the message baord soon.
