If not, the band starts at 9 and plays until 12. It will be our first time back with the band playing without Craig...we will all be surprised but I do understand their original keyboard player has been filling in. Please respond whether or not you plan to arrive early to eat so people know who they will be looking for. If not sure just update your reply as we get closer to the date. Thanks! :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will be all over the place but it is very small so be prepared...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210548744000</updated><rating><average>4.92000007629</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
