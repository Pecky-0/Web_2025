Following the sudden death of their brother, the large, Sephardic Ohaion family gathers at the deceased's house for the traditional seven days of mourning. Living and grieving together, rivalries and resentments test family unity, but never love. It's 1991 and the Gulf War's threat of missile attacks heightens tensions and moments of black humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Guest: Nadav Tamir, Consul General of Israel to New England&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Official Selection Cannes Film Festival • Winner Best Film &amp;amp; Best Actress, Jerusalem International Film Festival • Winner two Israeli Academy Awards&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend purchasing tickets online ahead of time.  There is nothing worse than schlepping all the way to the ICA only to find a sold-out show, or having to get into a long, never moving line in a huge crowd, making you late for the film.  Much better to walk right up to the Will Call and announce your arrival - to the consternation of those without tickets:  &lt;a href="https://buy.icaboston.org/public/auto_choose_ga.asp?area=1" target="_blank"&gt;The Seven Days Tickets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film, we will go to &lt;b&gt;Legal Test Kitchen&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;for conversation and discussion.  Please indicate whether you want me to make a reservation for you at the restaurant.  Please know that this is more than the usual 'meetup' committment. We cannot ask a busy restaurant on a Saturday night to hold tables for a large group, then not show up.  Long time members agree that 'I couldn't find the group' or 'sorry, had to cancel at the last minute' will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; be appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will stand in the front of the theater holding a MEETUP sign while singing the</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237852371000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seven Days (Shiva / Les Sept Jours)</name><id>10019915</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238886000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/10019915/</event_url></item>
