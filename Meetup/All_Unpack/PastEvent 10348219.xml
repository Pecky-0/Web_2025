(Thanks, Meagan!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 6:20 on Saturday, so let's meet BY 5:45 in front of the theater. If it sells out, there is a 7:00 show as well (which is why I'm going for the earlier one). I will be buying the tickets at 6:00 SHARP, so if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP at the last minute, please let me know with a phone call -- 508/308/4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you Friday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809951159/info" target="_blank"&gt;Angels and Demons&lt;/a&gt; can't be bad if it's anything like The DaVinci Code. Besides -- HELLO! -- Tom Hanks. Brilliant actor much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;When Robert Langdon discovers evidence of the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati -- the most powerful underground organization in history -- he also faces a deadly threat to the existence of the secret organization's most despised enemy: the Catholic Church. When Langdon learns that the clock is ticking on an unstoppable Illuminati time bomb, he jets to Rome, where he joins forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and enigmatic Italian scientist. Embarking on a nonstop hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra will follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that mark the Vatican's only hope for survival.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usual stuff:&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet inside the theater doors (or outside if it's nice out) and then I can buy us all discounted tickets ($8.50 each for FMM members and their guests). I also have $3 vouchers each for small sodas and small popcorns (can be used towards a larger size). As always, guests are welcome, just be sure to include them in the RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (2 hours before we meet). My cell is: 508/308-4897. I'm also good for directions if you get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to Fridays (I'll bring the coupons!) to chat about the movie (and just chat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll update the exact time of the meeting about 2 days before the meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you for Angels and Demons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244069897000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241578833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Angels and Demons</name><id>10348219</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243633500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/10348219/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
