We will be discussing the possibilty of establishing a Fashion Design and Marketing collaborative in Boston. This would involve a core group of members, once established, along with a regular monthly meeting. Their would be a commitment involved in which regular attendance would be expected. Looking forward to hearing ideas. Two of the main goals are for fashion designers to work collaboratively on projects and for fashion marketers in the group to make a commitment to work with the designers in the collaborative to promote their brands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Email Organizer For Mobile Phone Number</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>2523024</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367460601000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>fashionandmusiceventplanning</urlname><id>1408370</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Fashion and Music Event Planning</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1367113722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fashion Designers and Marketing Group</name><id>116534602</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367449200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fashionandmusiceventplanning/events/116534602/</event_url></item>
