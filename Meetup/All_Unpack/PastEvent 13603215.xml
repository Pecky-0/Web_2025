In the new book, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Cyclist&lt;/i&gt; we meet Lenz, a Pittsburgh native whose love affair with the bicycle led him to attempt an ambitious around-the-world tour in 1892. Armed with the latest technology (new safety bicycles, with a lower profile and pneumatic tires, had recently replaced the earlier high-wheel bikes), Lenz set out to document his travels and adventures for &lt;i&gt;Outing Magazine&lt;/i&gt;. Two years later, after a series of sometimes harrowing encounters, Lenz reached Turkey, on his way to Europe for the last leg of his journey. He was never heard from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;Makes for fascinating history [as] Herlihy combines an admirable talent for sleuthing with the narrative skills of a first-rate storyteller...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Library Journal&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Herlihy is the author of &lt;i&gt;Bicycle: The History&lt;/i&gt; and his work has been featured on NPR and Voice of America and in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Boston&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Historic Preservation&lt;/i&gt;. In 1999 Herlihy received the McNair History Award from the Wheelmen, the preeminent American association of antique bicycle collectors. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278944768000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274896532000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet David Herlihy, author of "Bicycle: The History" and "The Lost Cyclist"</name><id>13603215</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278716400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/13603215/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/b/global_15319371.jpeg</photo_url></item>
