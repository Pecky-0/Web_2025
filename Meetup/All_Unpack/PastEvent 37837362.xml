Let's plant some trees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join P-Collective member Christopher in the West Broadway/Westminster/Armory section of the West Side this Saturday, October 22th to participate in a Providence Neighborhood Planting Program event to benefit the neighborhood between Broadway and Westminster streets. Alongside neighborhood residents, we will help plant 19 street trees to beautify the neighborhood and enhance the existing streetscape. Seven Stars Bakery is contributing gift cards to the first five arrivals on Saturday morning - so get there early! We will meet at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;9:30AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at 330 Knight Street (a white block church) for a demonstration by the PNPP and the Providence City Forestry staff on how to plant the trees correctly and then we'll fan out through the neighborhood to help the residents with their plantings. Please note, it is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that we are there for the demonstration to participate in the planting. Please wear appropriate clothing - sturdy shoes or boots are necessary and gloves are highly recommended. If you have access to a shovel, pruners, or a saw - please bring them along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year's planting was a lot of fun on a beautiful day to enjoy the West Side neighborhood! So come on out, spend a few hours learning how to plant trees that will thrive, enjoy a fall afternoon in the sun, and let's have some fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Christopher is hosting this one - please look at his picture!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher</member_name><member_id>10240270</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319468920000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318960219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tree Planting on the West Side!</name><id>37837362</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319290200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/37837362/</event_url></item>
