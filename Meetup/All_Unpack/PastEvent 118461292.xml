 Now in its ninth year, the weekly Boston Poetry (formerly “Charles River Writers”) has long been a free forum for literary fellowship and discussion. It is entirely free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate, please RSVP here, and arrive bearing enough copies of the text you’d like to discuss – whether prose or verse – for each participant to have their own. If you do not have the means to make copies of your writing, send the text by attachment to bostonpoetryunion (at) gmail (dot) com not later than the night before the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, the moderator will invite a member or guest speaker to open the session with a brief talk on some literary topic. If you’re interested in delivering such a talk, email the organizers and let them know! Likewise let us know if you’d like to suggest a writing exercise or event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Morris</member_name><member_id>13415109</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368147914000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1368058507000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Workshop &amp; Writing Lab </name><id>118461292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368136800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/118461292/</event_url></item>
