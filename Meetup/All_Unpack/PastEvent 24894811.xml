AmpSurf is a group of surfers and other volunteers dedicated to helping the disabled learn how to surf!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we started in CA 9 years ago this is our first trip to the east coast and we are landing in York Beach Maine on August 18th and 19th, and we could really use some help both in the water and on land!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check us out at www.ampsurf.org or you can contact me directly at gjohnson@ampsurf.org Surfs Up!&lt;/p&gt;
