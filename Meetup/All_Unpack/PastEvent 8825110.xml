It's on my list of places to try and it's in West Newton.  From all the 'Net chatter, it seems like a cool Irish bar with a great menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want more details?  Check out their website: &lt;a href="http://www.oharas.us/paddys/paddys.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.oharas.us/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, we're right around the corner from Waltham - trying a new place nearby sounds great.  I hope you guys can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: If you haven't already, please bring a donation of $5 each to help cover the costs of running the group.  I appreciate your help in keeping us going.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me. 413-695-2121.
