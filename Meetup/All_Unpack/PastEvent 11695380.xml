It will be chilly there, but you may warm up with all the running around with the dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon,&lt;br /&gt;Plunk and Judi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a condition of attending this meetup you agree to release, hold harmless, and indemnify the organizer(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, and/or death, including those caused by negligence and or other reasons.
