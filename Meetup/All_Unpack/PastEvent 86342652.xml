I normally dont post 4ks but I do post obscure hikes, so this one qualifies due to way we are getting to the summit. The normal approach from the Zealand road is a pleasant but not that interesting route. The proposed hike is via the old Firewardens trail that splits off from the North Twin Trail. Despite being long ago abandoned, the trail is in excellent condition, in some ways better than many of the current trails in the whites. The trail consists of well graded switchbacks and goes through one of the most impressive mature white birch glades in the Whites. Unless you have a really old White Mountain guide, this trail is not on any recent maps. Unlike the Hale Brook Trail there are some interesting viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO NEED TO REPLY IF YOU ARE NOT ATTENDING&lt;/strong&gt;, but if you do sign up please change your status if your plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the time of the year and current weather, like many of the trails in the whites, the trail bed can get wet and the leaves on the ground can make it slippery. Please choose appropriate foot gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike is approximately 6 miles round trip with 2000 feet of elevation gain. Total trail time is expected to be 4 to 5 hours. This is a intermediate level hike. Novices in good physical condition should be able to complete it but I would not recomend it as a "first hike"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike is "dog friendly" for well socialized dogs. Please indicate if you are bringing a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location to meet is at the parking for the Noth Twin Trail. This is at the end of the rather long WMNF fire road #304. The turn off from RT 3 is south of Twin Mtn, just before an old travel court. There are WMNF camping spots along the lower section of the road with no facilities.Please factor in leaf season traffic when driving up. I do encourage car pooling for those from down south, if you do carpool please help the driver with gas costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather Saturday is supposed to be cool but sunny. Plan on fall gear with enough gear to cover all your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please answer all the questions, if you dont you will be placed on the wait list until they are answered or the trip is full.&lt;/p&gt;
