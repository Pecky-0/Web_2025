This is always one of the most popular weekends at our house and in the Mt Washington Valley overall so sign up early! We will have a two night minimum to stay at the lodge and will contact you with details about lodging and Icy event packages when you RSVP here on Meetup. See everyone up north!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin Buckley</member_name><member_id>3881633</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364848009000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363192248000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Season Send Off</name><id>109070442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363993200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/109070442/</event_url></item>
