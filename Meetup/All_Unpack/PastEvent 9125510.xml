<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's the day after Thanksgiving. If you have the day off and want to walk off some of your turkey dinner, join us for a nice local hike. Bad weather will postpone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beaver Brook is nearly 2,000 acres located in Hollis, Brookline, and Milford, New Hampshire. Hiking, biking, horseback riding, bird watching, and many other activities are enjoyed daily on the nearly 35 miles of trails at BBA. Each trail has been carefully mapped and designated for activities that will have the least impact on that particular area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trails are open from dawn until dusk, seven days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will walk various trails for a few hours. Expect to be out about 2 hours and go 4-5 miles.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What to bring:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear comfortable hiking shoes; although there's no mountain, these are real trails. Bring munchies and water. Bring a camera, if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, bring a printed copy of the map at &lt;a href="http://www.beaverbrook.org/PDFs/bbmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.beaverbroo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.beaverbrook.org/" target="_blank"&gt;www.beaverbrook.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at Maple Hill Farm, 117 Ridge Road, Hollis, NH 03049&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.beaverbrook.org/bbdirec.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.beaverbroo...&lt;/a&gt; for directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will bring my friendly black lab (Tessie). If you plan to bring a dog, please note it in your reply.
