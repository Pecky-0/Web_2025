<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Whist is an easy, fun, trick-taking game. Don't worry if you've never played it! If you've ever played hearts, spades, down-and-up the ladder, Wizard, or bridge, you can start playing Whist almost immediately. We should get some carpools together and hit a few Whist events, starting with this one!&lt;/p&gt;
