Do you wear an eye patch, make ARRGH and GRRR sounds and say Shiver Me Timbers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Is your name Gilligan? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Do you drink? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Would you like to relax on a sailboat, cruising Long Island Sound for two hours? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of these questions then join the New Haven Collective on their return voyage on the Quinnipiak sailboat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A traditionally rigged, wooden schooner, the Quinnipiack is 91 feet long from the tip of her bowsprit to the end of her main boom. Her deck is 65 feet long and 20 feet wide and provides an exciting setting for entertaining guests. Sit back and enjoy a sail or have your guests be a part of the crew. The S/V Quinnipiack can accommodate up to 40 passengers. Bring a picnic; beer and wine are permitted on board. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quinnipiak leaves Long Wharf at 5:00pm sharp, PLEASE BE AT THE DOCKS NO LATER 4:45PM. Directions to follow... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring wine, beer and food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need an minimum of 30 people to make this happen. Please give your money to myself or Swashbuckler Mark Silva NO LATER THAN April 30th. We both attend events regularly, however, if you cannot get to us in time, please call or email so we can collect your fees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is $30 per person. If more than 30 people RSVP the cost goes down and you will receive a small refund.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year we had 40 sailors (NHC Members) attend and each received $7.50 back that night. If we' re able to get the 40 attendees, I would like to strongly suggest we donate our excess funds to our NHC member Amanda O. For her Team in Training charity: &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=2883813"&gt;http://newintown.meet...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With your generosity we could raise about $300 towards the Leukemia &amp;amp; Lymphoma Society's. Please note in your RSVP is we can donate your excess funds for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WE ENCOURAGE PAYMENT ASAP TO RESERVE THE DATE OF SAIL. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following people have paid:&lt;br /&gt;Jason&lt;br /&gt;Alexis&lt;br /&gt;Glenn&lt;br /&gt;Amanda O. and Guest&lt;br /&gt;Christine and Guest&lt;br /&gt;Silas Dean&lt;br /&gt;Ben&lt;br /&gt;Mark Silva&lt;br /&gt;Sven&lt;br /&gt;Adrianne&lt;br /&gt;Jeannie&lt;br /&gt;Lucinda&lt;br /&gt;Frank&lt;br /&gt;Diane&lt;br /&gt;Don&lt;br /&gt;Natalie&lt;br /&gt;Christine H&lt;br /&gt;Beth&lt;br /&gt;Hakan&lt;br /&gt;KBS&lt;br /&gt;Eric + Guest&lt;br /&gt;Steve T.&lt;br /&gt;New to CT&lt;br /&gt;Michelle&lt;br /&gt;Reena Tank&lt;br /&gt;Andrea&lt;br /&gt;Solimar + Guest&lt;br /&gt;If your name is not on the list above, please contact myself or Mark to make payment arrangements.
