This will be our second meetup at Mom and Paws.Â  If you go to the Mom and Paws Website, you can see photos of this facility. Like North Shore Dog, they charge an admission fee of $5.00/dog; but if fewer than 10 dogs come, there will be a charge of $50.00 for the use of the room. So, all you Cavalier lovers from Quincy, Boston, Arlington, and points South, please RSVP positive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the easiest route to take from the North Shore (not the most direct, but the least complicated!): From Rt. 128, take Exit 29, which is Route 2. Go East on Rte 2 (towards Boston and Cambridge). Rt. 2 remains a highway all the way until it reaches Rte 16 aka Alewife Brook Parkway. You bear Right at the Alewife MBTA station, staying on Rt. 2. At the rotary, turn Right onto Concord Ave (towards Belmont) and Right again onto Smith Place. Go past the WOW (Work-Out-World) sign, all the way to the end of Smith Place; then Left onto Mooney, and you'll see the signs for Mom and Paws. Park anywhere in the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not coming from the North Shore, 127 Smith Place is very near Fresh Pond. At the Fresh Pond Circle, you take Concord Ave off the rotary (you're going West towards Belmont, not East towards Boston) and Smith Place is the second right turn off Concord.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364393485000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362865564000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Explore a new indoor experience in Cambridge at Moms and Paws</name><id>108462222</id><headcount>15</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364047200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/108462222/</event_url></item>
