It has hundreds of extensions available and a very active full-time product development support group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline will cover the following things on Joomla as time permits, using a system that she uses to explain Joomla to clients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) a brief overview of Joomla from a user's point of view, giving definitions and examples of content, sections, and categories; and how they relate to each other.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the main distinctions between modules and components, pointing out some of the most common components and how they are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) the administrator's interface, its standard menus, and what they control.  She will also cover the most important &amp;quot;managers&amp;quot;, e.g., Content Items Mgr , Static Content Mgr, Category Mgr, Media Mgr, Section Mgr, Menu Mgr.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) how templates work, and what things are included in a template.  How to install and switch between templates to get different appearances and behaviors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) menus and how to use them when designing a site; the one-to-one relationships between menus and pages within categories and sections.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) some the more useful modules that Caroline has found and used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) example client sites that she has developed and worked on, including what modifications from the basic Joomla kit that were made and standard components or modules that were used.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) favorite resources for learning, for templates, for other addins, please mention them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting will in the conference room on the basement level of 111 Cummington Street.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this meeting the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; Joomla V1.0.X system standard components and modules, rather than customizations will be covered.  This will be an introductory talk to give people a good overview.  If group members are so inclined a later meeting could cover development of new modules or components. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;========================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group is still gathering momentum.  Please come and discuss your goals with the group, what you want to see covered, and when you want to them covered (or want to cover them yourself!)  There are as many CMS applications as people implementing them.  There are also many technologies involved, and many ways to use them.  So please come to learn and have your voice heard.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come prepared with your questions and answers ....this meeting will be a lot of fun and we will all learn a lot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>RichKin</member_name><member_id>3557763</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182739332000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People interested in CMS</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newengland-webcms</urlname><id>422397</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Web Content Management Systems Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179966369000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Web Content Management Systems June Meetup</name><id>5811839</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182380400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newengland-webcms/events/5811839/</event_url></item>
