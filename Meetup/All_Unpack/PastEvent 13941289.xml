It's been a consistent best seller and other bookclubs highly recommend it.  I think it should make for a great, provocative read.&lt;br /&gt;      In August, our choice is Steig Larrson's second book in his trilogy, &amp;quot;The Girl Who Played With Fire&amp;quot;.  So many of us enjoyed the first book, &amp;quot;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&amp;quot;, that this was a natural! The August meetup will be Sunday, August 29th.  Labor Day is the following weekend.&lt;br /&gt;      This month's book (for June) was &amp;quot;The Book Thief&amp;quot; and it generated some thoughtful discussion.  I was distressed, however, about so many people signing up and then not coming without cancelling on our site.  This is unfair to the people on the waiting list who want to come.  Please keep that in mind if you say yes and then find that you can't attend.   &lt;br /&gt;       Enjoy every moment of the beautiful days ahead and happy reading!
