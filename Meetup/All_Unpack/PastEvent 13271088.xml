Please bring your questions and any information you feel is relevant to share with the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last meeting was informatiive with Gaston and Michael helping our new member with some good information.  Gaston came armed with oodles of relevant articles for us to take home and read.  I reported on Liquid CMO which is getting quite a bit of attention as this new and more potent form is blowing the doors off many peoples symptoms of Fibro.  It is already amazing for arthritis relief but it is also being successfully used for MS.  If anyone want to know more about his exciting new product go to website LiquidCMO.com and read the testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on June 9th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember donations to defray my costs of room rental and meetup charges are always welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276137269000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272050771000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reading Fibromyalgia Support Group</name><id>13271088</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276124400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/13271088/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
