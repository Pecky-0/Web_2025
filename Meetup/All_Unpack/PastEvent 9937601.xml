Dyer&lt;/b&gt; explores the spiritual journey from ambition to meaning. The powerful shift from the ego constructs we are taught early in life by parents and society—which promote an emphasis on achievement and accumulation—are shown in contrast to a life of meaning, focused on serving and giving back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the intertwined stories of an overachieving businessman, a mother of two seeking her own expression in the world, and a director trying to make a name for himself, this entertaining film not only inspires, but also teaches us how to create a life of meaning and purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional cast members include:&lt;br /&gt;Michael DeLuise&lt;br /&gt;Portia de Rossi&lt;br /&gt;Ed Kerr&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Sturges&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*******************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Wayne W.
