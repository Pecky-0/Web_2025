(Includes FREE lunch: 11:30-12:30- pre-registration required)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-year vegetarian and nationally renowned chef, author, lecturer and educator Joe Lucier will expand on the notion that being healthy is our natural state, if we understand what to give our bodies on a daily basis. Learn the crucial role of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, phytonutrients and anti-oxidants, as well as the harmful effects of processed foods. Discover you too can eat to heal your body and take charge of your weight with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong correlation between between food choices and health. While cancer, heart disease, malnourishment, obesity and diabetes remain the major causes of death, more than 90 percent of these conditions are food-related and caused by poor eating choices that you will learn to avoid. &lt;br /&gt;
