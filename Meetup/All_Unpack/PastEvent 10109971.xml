Instead of Hartford as was previously discussed, we are going to hit up Foxwoods Saturday night.&lt;br /&gt;Plan of action&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the day, Sergey and I will give our appearance talk, culminating at Camouflage. After that, everyone will have a few hours down time before we meet up at Foxwoods.&lt;br /&gt;Location to meet in Foxwoods is the big glass Indian. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone should be there around 7, ABSOLUTELY no later than 7:30. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/88/232595458_0fa817b250.jpg?v=0" target="_blank"&gt;http://farm1.static.f...&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt; night time pic&lt;br /&gt;At this point, we will grab dinner as a group and talk over our pregame strategies for the night. This is something we haven't done in a while but is something that is going to be implemented in to future meetups. &lt;br /&gt;Around 9:30, we should be finishing up dinner and can head over to Shrine. If you want to invite any girls to come down and meet at the club, THIS is the time to do it. Dinner should be time for just the meetup group discussion.&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;JC&lt;br /&gt;Ages: 20s &amp;amp; 30s&lt;br /&gt;Dress Code: Trendy, Fashionable (Peacocking allowed, but make sure it's tasteful)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call Sergey (860) 933 1224 or myself (203) 410 6861</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238801708000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Night - 4-11-09 - Shrine at Foxwoods</name><id>10109971</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239490800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10109971/</event_url></item>
