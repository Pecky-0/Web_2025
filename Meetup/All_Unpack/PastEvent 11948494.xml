<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>When I was in high school, I had a literature teacher and her name is Mrs. O’Malley. Mrs. O’Malley did this thing where the entire class would set around and drink hot coco and read poetry out loud (there was finger clapping and funny sweaters involved). Well, anyway I thought that it would be cool if we did something like that (maybe without the sweater part, although it was fun), and we wrote our own or recited atheist/secular poetry. It will expose us to some of the very fine atheist/secular poets of our time and of times past. If your interested email back with what poem you would like to read or if you want to write your own poem. There will  be Beer/Wine incase you dont want coco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a taste of some good poetry that can be read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubade, By Philip Larkin (1922 - 1985)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work all day, and get half-drunk at night. &lt;br /&gt;Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare. &lt;br /&gt;In time the curtain-edges will grow light. &lt;br /&gt;Till then I see what's really always there: &lt;br /&gt;Unresting death, a whole day nearer now, &lt;br /&gt;Making all thought impossible but how &lt;br /&gt;And where and when I shall myself die. &lt;br /&gt;Arid interrogation: yet the dread &lt;br /&gt;Of dying, and being dead, &lt;br /&gt;Flashes afresh to hold and horrify. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse &lt;br /&gt;- The good not done, the love not given, time &lt;br /&gt;Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because &lt;br /&gt;An only life can take so long to climb &lt;br /&gt;Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never; &lt;br /&gt;But at the total emptiness for ever, &lt;br /&gt;The sure extinction that we travel to &lt;br /&gt;And shall be lost in always. Not to be here, &lt;br /&gt;Not to be anywhere, &lt;br /&gt;And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a special way of being afraid &lt;br /&gt;No trick dispels. Religion used to try, &lt;br /&gt;That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade &lt;br /&gt;Created to pretend we never die, &lt;br /&gt;And specious stuff that says No rational being &lt;br /&gt;Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing &lt;br /&gt;That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound, &lt;br /&gt;No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with, &lt;br /&gt;Nothing to love or link with, &lt;br /&gt;The anasthetic from which none come round. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it stays just on the edge of vision, &lt;br /&gt;A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill &lt;br /&gt;That slows each impulse down to indecision. &lt;br /&gt;Most things may never happen: this one will, &lt;br /&gt;And realisation of it rages out &lt;br /&gt;In furnace-fear when we are caught without &lt;br /&gt;People or drink. Courage is no good: &lt;br /&gt;It means not scaring others. Being brave &lt;br /&gt;Lets no one off the grave. &lt;br /&gt;Death is no different whined at than withstood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape. &lt;br /&gt;It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know, &lt;br /&gt;Have always known, know that we can't escape, &lt;br /&gt;Yet can't accept. One side will have to go. &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring &lt;br /&gt;In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring &lt;br /&gt;Intricate rented world begins to rouse. &lt;br /&gt;The sky is white as clay, with no sun. &lt;br /&gt;Work has to be done. &lt;br /&gt;Postmen like doctors go from house to house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is cool poetry tool:   &lt;a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poetrytool.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.poetryfoun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for BA table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259778311000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259091171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Secular Poetry Out Loud</name><id>11948494</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259445600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/11948494/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
