A couple of my friends have seen it and they said it was pretty good. It's currently showing at the West Boylston Cinema for only $5. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When decorated soldier Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up in the body of an unknown man, he discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. In an assignment unlike any he's ever known, he learns he's part of a government experiment called the "Source Code," a program that enables him to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7:15 PM. Let's plan to meet in the lobby around 6:45. Anyone who wants to can join me at O'Connor's after the film. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you need to reach me, send me a message or call my cell phone at 508-981-0455.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my photo, but with a goatee.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307111963000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306631243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Source Code</name><id>20107301</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307054700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/20107301/</event_url></item>
