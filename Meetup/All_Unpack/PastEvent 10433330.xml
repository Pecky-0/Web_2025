So, time to start planning for the &amp;quot;good times&amp;quot; to roll. Grab your toothbrush, your suitcase, your flip flops and lets boogie.  Whether you long for short weekend jaunts, cruises, tropical beaches, or just a daytrip we can do it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellow travelers, our first meetup has been scheduled. We are having a get together, complete with happy hour and appetizers (if you wish). We will get to know each other and do some planning. All you need to do is bring a smile and an idea or two to share as to what you think will work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at Westbrook Lobster Restaurant in Wallingford and plan our &amp;quot;getaway&amp;quot;. Perhaps a new travel buddy, or buddies, is in the wind. Let's ride it together...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Meetup sign on our FUN table!!!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244843887000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242602240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get Acquainted Brainstorming Session...Where Do You Want To Go???</name><id>10433330</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243976400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/10433330/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/c/a/global_7731530.jpeg</photo_url></item>
