<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will meet on the Dartmouth Green. I'll bring some picnic blankets, utensils and paper plates. In case of rain, we will re-locate to Kemeny Hall (located 1 block north of the Green on North Main Street, just behind Baker-Berry Library). If you have difficulty finding us or are wondering if we have re-located to Kemeny Hall, you can call my cell phone: 773-330-5652.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a dish to share and (if at all possible) label the ingredients. This will help us to avoid any discrepancies that may occur as a result of people having different interpretations of which foods are considered to be &amp;quot;vegan&amp;quot; (ex. honey, white sugar). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome vegans, vegetarians and omnivores at our Meetup events. However, because this is a vegan potluck, we ask that any dishes that you bring be vegan (no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no gelatin). If you have any questions about whether a food item satisfies these criteria or if you need suggestions of easy dishes to make/buy, please feel free to contact me: Lauren.A.Thompson@Dartmouth.edu.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear something with the word "vegan" or "tofu</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lola</member_name><member_id>915277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243695197000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pioneers of Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-430</urlname><id>650201</id><group_lat>43.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2699966431</group_lon><name>NH/VT Vegan Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213638480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vegan Potluck </name><id>8152960</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214064000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-430/events/8152960/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/global_1994793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
