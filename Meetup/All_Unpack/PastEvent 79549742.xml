<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;i know a lot of you are busy and cant make meet ups, so id like to hear from peoole about what days and times they would be able to make a meet up. Im flexible, so it really doesnt matter to me, when, because im always avialable and id love to have more people attend. For any new members that may be curious id like to let you know how a meet up nornally goes. Normally we have been having them at my home, i have a large room and we all come in and have a seat while our pugs run around together and play and sniff each other. It is a loy if fun and most pugs will pass out for a long nap after the meet up. It is a lot of fun and Id love to see more of a turn out. Thanks everyone and please suggest some times and maybe even some new places, it was very fun to meet up at Davenports place last time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sara</member_name><member_id>13564479</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346589761000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners and Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernMApugs</urlname><id>1207399</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346076230000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet Up!</name><id>79549742</id><headcount>3</headcount><duration>3600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346511600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernMApugs/events/79549742/</event_url></item>
