<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The monthlies are SOCIAL events. Although we do talk business at them for maybe half an hour and sometimes play evidence clips (hoping to this time!), these things are so y'all can hear first hand what we do, ask questions, tell your own stories, etc.  They're so we can all have a little no-pressure time together, and it kinda helps us all by reminding each other that this stuff *isn't* just TV and book fodder, but real events happening to real people - like us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Asia ha a decent buffet going til 8:00 - $12 per person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See y'all there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;And seeing as we are getting new members almost everyday just want to say,Come with the expectation of buying something. The owner is very cool about us being there as long as everybody gets something,even if just a drink. Thanks Mike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the person who resembles my profile image, but ask at the entry anyhow!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239049504000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232670864000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group February Meetup</name><id>9581446</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235691000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/9581446/</event_url></item>
