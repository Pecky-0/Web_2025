Healthy, satisfying Thai food, friendly staff, and never crowded. Killer Thai iced tea and pad thai. Homemade noodles. Salads with sesame ginger dressing. What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...if you were thinking alcohol, unfortunately they do not have a license, but you are free to bring your own beer or wine. There is a liquor store a block away from the restaurant. I think I have some extra beers I can bring. Nothing like a relaxing Thai meal after a hard day's work. Screw it, I'm going alone if no one signs up ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there. Not sure how long I'll keep this group going without adequate interest, so let's make this month kick ass to make it last!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*suggestion: please bring cash to make the bill paying easier*&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing my red t-shirt... the place is real small so it won't be hard</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285720543000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221623343000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yummy food!!</name><id>8773592</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222297200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/8773592/</event_url></item>
