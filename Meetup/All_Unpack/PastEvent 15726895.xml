Come see it with me on Thursday, December 16, which the Somerville Theater says on its website will be our last chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a quote from the &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;'s review back in September: &amp;quot;. . . Affleck gives [his] voice a velvety growl a woman would remember . . . .&amp;quot; Honestly. What is taking me so long?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for me and my bright red backpack in the lobby of the Somerville Theater from 6:45 to 7:00. At that point, we can head into the auditorium. The movie starts at 7:10, and I certainly don't want to miss one word from Ben Affleck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you arrive late, look for me in the lobby of the theater after the movie. I'll linger there for a few minutes to make sure we have everyone. And we can decide then if we would like to head to the Diesel Cafe or another spot for some conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the Somerville Theater!&lt;br /&gt;Marianne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See the event description.
