We organize and host meditation and breathing workshops, meditation mixers, free meditation experience sessions and more fun activities in the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bostonians are known to lead hectic professional and personal lives. The busier one is, the more one has to meditate. Meditation helps one dive inward to the source of joy, energy and creativity, and come out into activity with that stillness. It is a daily practice to center oneself and allows one to stay in the game at their best.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Increasingly, corporations and other institutions are offering mediation workshops. CEOs and executives at top companies, including Google, Salesforce and Tupperware, state in recent magazine articles that meditation restores balance in their lives, improves sleep and&lt;/span&gt; provides them with a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Meditates is supported by The Art of Living Foundation. Founded in 1981, the Art of Living Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational and humanitarian organization working in consultative status with the United Nations’ Economic and Social Council on initiatives related to health, meditation, education, sustainable development, conflict resolution and disaster relief.  Connect with Boston Meditates on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/bostonmeditates"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/bostonmeditates"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.77</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1218761084000</created><lat>42.3800010681</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>244</id><urlkey>yoga</urlkey><name>Yoga</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1322</id><urlkey>meditation</urlkey><name>Meditation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9816</id><urlkey>stress</urlkey><name>Overcoming Stress</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10290</id><urlkey>spirituality</urlkey><name>Spirituality</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10306</id><urlkey>wellness</urlkey><name>Wellness</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16144</id><urlkey>self-empowerment-exploration</urlkey><name>Self Empowerment &amp; Exploration</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17674</id><urlkey>health-and-wellness</urlkey><name>Health and Wellness</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>32030</id><urlkey>sudarshan-kriya</urlkey><name>Sudarshan Kriya</name></topics_item></topics><name>"Boston Meditates" Meditation Group</name><id>1257412</id><members>642</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>6404070</member_id><name>Anuj Madan</name></organizer><urlname>bostonmeditates</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/b/c/600_152498332.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/b/c/highres_152498332.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>152498332</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/b/c/thumb_152498332.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Cambridge</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/bostonmeditates/</link><lon>-71.1299972534</lon></item>
