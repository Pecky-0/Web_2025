Our intention is to bring the undisclosed stories, testimony and evidence concerning 9/11 into mainstream public discourse. It is our belief that an educated public will demand new independent investigations that will ultimately lead to our larger goals of justice and redress for the countless victims of 9/11 and its aftermath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time:&lt;br /&gt;10:00 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. with lunch and dinner breaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Program:&lt;br /&gt;The program starts at 10 am with a showing of the first part of the documentary film &amp;quot;9/11 Press for Truth&amp;quot; introduced by Robert McIlvane, 9/11 family member who lost his son on 9/11 followed by presentations and panels through to 10 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the website for further details: &lt;a href="http://911Hartford.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://911Hartford.or...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MV911T members will go down to Hartford the evening before, so please contact us if you are interested in carpooling or room-sharing: MerrimackValley911Truth@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>3581956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542245000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190845958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>9/11: Family Members, First Responders &amp; Experts Speak Out</name><id>6433946</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194098400000</time><rsvp_limit>999</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/6433946/</event_url></item>
