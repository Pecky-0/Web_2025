Meet us at 10 for hiking or join us first for breakfast at 8:30 at &lt;a href="http://www.marshlandrestaurant.com/"&gt;Marshland Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; on Route 6A in Sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncape.com says "&lt;strong&gt;Murkwood Conservation Area and Scorton Creek:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;The Murkwood Conservation area covers 79 acres in East Sandwich, and a short trail meanders through a lovely woodland just off Route 6A near Scorton Creek. All around is sprawling salt marsh and the forest path is interrupted now and again with side paths, so walkers can glimpse the marsh. The path can be affected by the tidal flow, so be prepared to get your feet wet. There are numerous American hollies to view, but while walking, you should look out for poison ivy. The walk is especially lovely at sunset, and it is possible to catch sight of osprey, eagles and white-tailed deer. In the same area, it's worth visiting Talbot's Point on Old Country Road. This land stretches over 112 acres and extends along Scorton Marsh. Trails wind through oak, white and red pine, pitch pine, beech and spruce. Birding here can yield sightings of osprey, marsh hawks and terns."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring water, snacks, wear good boots and dress for the day. Hope to see you.&lt;/p&gt;
