<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It supposed to be good weather this Saturday. I am planning to enjoy some fresh air at Blue Hills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to start from Chickatawbut Overlook, taking yellow-dot trail to the red-dot trail, then take part of the skyline trail, and back onto yellow-dot path. It looks like 500 ft elevation gain, maybe 1 and 1/2 hour to 2 hours(?). Hoping to be done by noon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction: I93-S. Take Exit 5B to merge onto MA-28 N/Randolph Ave toward Milton. Turn right at the Chickatawbut Rd. There is a parking right there, but not that one. Keep going up a little more, then you will find parking space at both sides of the road.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing Padres Baseball hat (Padres who?....
