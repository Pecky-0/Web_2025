We'll have a couple of tables reserved for the pool sharks, but plenty of non-billiards hanging out as well.  Boston Billiards has some great appetizers and a full bar which no doubt we'll be taking advantage of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://riroads.com/images/boston_billiards2.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So look no further if you're seeking like-minded progressives to play pool with in Boston, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while avoiding the 8 ball, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in.  If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Show up at 7PM to settle in, get a drink and order some yummy appetizers.  Pool tables are reserved from 7:30-9:30PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to connect outside of SoJust events?
