There will be NO meet-up in September as a result.  Next meetup will be October 6.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planned for that date is to have a bankruptcy attorney come to talk about the newer rules in bankrupties, what a bankruptcy can accomplish and what it can't.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have occasionally used a bankruptcy filing to help a client avoid an auction, when there has not been enough time to put together a short sale.  And then done the short sale.   A bankruptcy is better for them than a foreclosure!  It can be a tool you want to know about in this real estate investing climate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmest regards,&lt;br /&gt;Annie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and go down the stairs to our meeting room on the lower level.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223336251000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217894607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club September Meetup</name><id>8477348</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220310000000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/8477348/</event_url></item>
