Herb will use props to act out the types! The Myers-Briggs is a must - to understand people and it covers many bases the Enneagram doesn't touch. It's also the most widely known personality system in the world.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and/or share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks. Great food, company and an interesting topic - an awesome way to spend a Friday night!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296922820000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296098282000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Myers-Briggs</name><id>16203170</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296865800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/16203170/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/0/4/global_7624356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
