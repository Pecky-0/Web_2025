On this night they present two films by the Spanish non-fiction director José Luis Guerín. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reserved tickets were available to the group up until Jan 30 and those who requested them were notified.  People without reserved tickets are recommended to get to the theater an hour early for the chance of getting a seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obsessed with the essentially cinematic qualities of travel and motion, Guerín's films lead the viewer on a voyage of discovery to a &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; place... Together Guerín's peripetatic and wonderfully curious films create a singular mode of cinema that revels in visual and sensual beauty even as it boldly experiments with narrative structures and provocatively intermingles documentary and fiction, memory and desire. HFA Description &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In The City of Slyvia&lt;/b&gt;  84 minutes &lt;br /&gt;In the City of Sylvia begins with an apple, an orange, and a map. A man, scruffy, tormented, a romantic no doubt, suggesting a young Rimbaud or Modigliani, sits on a bed, scribbling on a notepad with the quiet desperation of someone who is blocked, trying to regain time or something lost to memory. At a coffee shop, an epic search begins. A waitress bungles an order, and amidst the din of finicky requests and cups and glasses tumbling over, a tale of passion, told in a voluptuous language of spatial-temporal equations, is born, passionately and unpretentiously. The desperately-looking man, let us call him Él (Xavier Lafitte), is unfazed by the noise or the shadows cast by the sun, transfixed by hordes of women, their lips, eyes, hair, immaculate curves, before taking pencil to paper. And so an abstract portrait of an artist as a young lover begins.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man with the movie camera, writer-director José Luis Guerin, conjures a spellbinding relationship between background and foreground planes, so that a woman in the distance looks as if she were whispering into the ear or caressing the face of a stranger sitting at an adjacent table. It is through a poetic kaleidoscope of bodies, reflected and refracted by mirrors, that one particular girl, let us call her Ella (Pilar López de Ayala), comes into focus and a hunt begins?through the streets of a gorgeous French town where trains cruelly interrupt Él's pursuit, heartlessly threatening to steal Ella forever from his gaze. Seemingly aimed at voyeurs, the film is built on sensuous interplays between people and objects, reality and representation, implying something profound is at risk here, and the simultaneous thrill and danger of every scene nearly stops the heart.  Slant Magazine &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unas fotos en la ciudad de Sylvia&lt;/b&gt;  67 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This remarkable companion piece to In the City of Sylvia offers a  &lt;br /&gt;compendium of images recorded by Guerín in Strasbourg while searching for the traces of a (fictional?) brief encounter some years earlier with a young woman named Sylvia. The beautiful black and white digital cinematography alternates between moving and still images, stitching together a unique kind of film journal, a cinematic sketchbook for In the City of Sylvia, a reworking of the photographic and documentary roots of cinema, and something absolutely new. A must-see.   HFA Description &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there and I will also be checking if the HFA can reserve us some tickets for these films. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>As is our custom, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row after the film and Q&amp;A. At events when the director is present things can be a bit chaotic- so don't forget to look for us near the front row.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199925830000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>In The City of Sylvia- Director Present</name><id>7075635</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202601600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7075635/</event_url></item>
