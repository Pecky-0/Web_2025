Is religion a force for good or evil in the world? Can ancient texts be squared with modern science? Can morality be divorced from religion? How important is God to Jewish identity? Christopher Hitchens is one of the most prominent and controversial writers in the media today and the author of the bestselling book God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. David Wolpe, Rabbi of Temple Sinai in Los Angeles, was named the #1 Pulpit Rabbi in America by Newsweek magazine. He is the author of seven books, including Why Faith Matters, a response to the ideas of Hitchens and other atheist thinkers. Their spirited conversation will be moderated by Tom Ashbrook, award winning journalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, March 23, 2010 at 7:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;Back Bay Events Center at 180 Berkeley St. on the corner of Berkeley and Stuart St in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?addr=477+Longwood+Ave&amp;amp;csz=Boston+MA+02215&amp;amp;country=us" target="_blank"&gt;Map &amp;amp; Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will not be attending even though my RSVP says I will.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269560443000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266425434000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Great God Debate: Christopher Hitchens and Rabbi David Wolpe</name><id>12628279</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269387000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/12628279/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/2/global_7423922.jpeg</photo_url></item>
