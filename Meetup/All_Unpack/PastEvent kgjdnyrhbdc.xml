<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, this month we'll be meeting at the Rusty Hammer, on the corner of State and Pleasant in downtown Portsmouth. A former neighbor of mine is a friend of the owner, so there is very good reason for me to believe the ghost stories he's told me about the place! See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly dinner meetings are primarily non-mandatory networking events. Although we talk business updates for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group. Because our regular place has closed down we are going back to our roots and will be choosing a different reportedly haunted location to meet at each month. Keep your eye on the meetup post for details. We look forward to you joining us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie Roy</member_name><member_id>4599203</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369273663000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852354000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>kgjdnyrhbdc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369261800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/118146902/</event_url></item>
