&lt;p&gt;Now it is time for&amp;nbsp;the Red Sox Natives first Happy Hour of&amp;nbsp;2012 followed by&amp;nbsp;a Bruins&amp;nbsp;Game&amp;nbsp;Viewing&amp;nbsp;option.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great and the full menu will be available for purchase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early&amp;nbsp;by 6:00 PM and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing. Stop by for drinks, stay for dinner and stick around&amp;nbsp;to watch the Bruins game.&amp;nbsp; Or arrive&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;later and stay until when ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Time is 7:05 PM for the Bruins vs the New Jersey Devils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's in front of Bank of America and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station&amp;nbsp;via the&amp;nbsp;Reading and Haverhill Trains stopping at Wakefield Station&amp;nbsp;with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion&amp;nbsp;Street, right on&amp;nbsp;to Main Street and 1 block to Water Street. If you are joining us from the City this is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink.&amp;nbsp;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please&amp;nbsp;RSVP early if you think you can attend. Invite, guests, friends, and co-workers. Soon we will&amp;nbsp;invite several&amp;nbsp;other groups to join us so space may become limited. Let's have as many Natives there as possible and take over Harrington's once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following groups&amp;nbsp;are being&amp;nbsp;invited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield Weeknights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Happy Hour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
