&lt;p&gt;This is a co-post with Design Venturers Western Mass. DVWM is hosting a regional photographers networking event at John Polak Photography Studio at Eastworks. We are planning on inviting Meetup organizers from other, local photography meetup groups so we can get a sense of what goes on elsewhere. Scott Erb and Donna Dufault, from the Worcester Alliance of Photographers (800 members strong) are coming to chat with us in person. We may set up a Google+ Hangout for folks who can't be there in person. So, this will be an opportunity to share ideas about Meetup projects, find out what works and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to steal a page out of the WAP play book and have the first part of the meetup as a social time. Bring photos, equipment, ideas, anything you'd like to share and show. We can reserve the latter part of the meeting for our "topic" - Meeting other Meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSVPing at the DVWM event page will be helpful :)&lt;/p&gt;

Go to the fourth floor. Go to the end of the hallway, and take a left. Go down to Suite #408. You're there.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Hoag</member_name><member_id>7353473</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365556597000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nohowebdev</urlname><id>540457</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Northampton Web Developers/ Web Designers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364841929000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Western Mass Photographers Regional Networking Event</name><id>112113992</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>9000000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365546600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nohowebdev/events/112113992/</event_url></item>
