This is not a Meetup for beginners or those who are practicing basics. Come if you think two hours of signing is not enough and you'd you like another margarita, please! Come if you like to tell and/or enjoy ASL storytelling and jokes. We're starting early and staying late. Of course, as always, voices off (but you knew that already)! Directions are available on the Tavern on the Square website. If you take the T, get off at the Porter Square T Stop (on the Red Line) and look down Mass Ave to your left. There it is, within eye view!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be at a big table in back, signing!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Erika Wentworth</member_name><member_id>487803</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320622719000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>ASL Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonasl</urlname><id>1298565</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston ASL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316727371000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yes, it's an ASL SOCIAL, on a Friday night!</name><id>34610302</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1320444000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonasl/events/34610302/</event_url></item>
