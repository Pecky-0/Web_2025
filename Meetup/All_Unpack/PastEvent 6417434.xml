<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll be digging into the representational theory of the mind; the idea that all that happens in the mind -- consciousness, intentionality, meaning and all that -- is best seen as an act of representation. It's a popular view, but as with almost all theories in the philosophy of mind, I have my grave doubts that there's really anything in the box past the packaging... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll start us out with a mini-presentation that I'll try to post this week. We'll also visit the subject at the next meetup, since Amy has promised to present Wittgenstein soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a good but long winded background source is the &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-representational/" target="_blank"&gt;Standord Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeya there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sean Lee</member_name><member_id>2978255</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191711743000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>philosophy-185</urlname><id>331299</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy of Mind Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190642929000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Next meeting: Representations and Meaning</name><id>6417434</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191538800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/philosophy-185/events/6417434/</event_url></item>
