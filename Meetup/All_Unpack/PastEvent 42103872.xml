&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Let me tell you a story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Once upon a time there&amp;nbsp;was a wise king. He&amp;nbsp;had a group of very good&amp;nbsp;advisors. One of them was his favorite. One day, the king took all his&amp;nbsp;advisors outside. He took a stick and drew a line in the sand. Then he asked his advisors to shorten the line without touching it. One by one, they came forward, looked at the line, and walked away. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to do it. Last came the king&amp;rsquo;s favorite. He took the same stick and drew another line in the sand, parallel to the first one and much longer, thereby shortening the first line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;The world is like the short line, and meditation is like the longer one. When you meditate, you begin to see your worldly problems from a different angle. Your perspective changes. The stresses of the outside world are still there, but they are no longer in control of your life because you know how to draw on the strength from your innermost self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Join Allan as he offers tools to help you navigate through life&amp;rsquo;s challenges and find peace, serenity, and fulfillment within through meditation on the inner Light. The world may be insane today, but you don't have to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in Nordic Hall.
