This year organizers are going all out with a &lt;b&gt;Lovefest for the Bicycle&lt;/b&gt; theme for people of all ages and abilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland Bicycle Commuting Meetup and Portland Green Streets are joining together in the fray!  We'll share a table and are looking for volunteers.  Of special interest to Meetup members with proven traffic experience (especially LCI's and Traffic Skills 101 graduates!) is a &amp;quot;Bike Safety Q &amp;amp; A Station&amp;quot; – for those burning &amp;quot;What am I Really Supposed to do in This Particular Road Situation??&amp;quot; questions. If you wish to volunteer, sign up for shifts on this &lt;a href="http://www.doodle.com/7kfbf8yzhfs4tv83" target="_blank"&gt;Doodle calendar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Streets will be hosting a Stencil-Your-Own Green Streets Shirt.
