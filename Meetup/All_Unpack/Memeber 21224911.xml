He doesn't really get a chance to socialize with other dogs, so I would like to be able to have him interact with other dogs.  It would also be great for me to meet other people and their pets.</bio><topics><topics_item><id>17407</id><urlkey>dog-parks</urlkey><name>Dog Parks</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>19163</id><urlkey>doggie-playgroups</urlkey><name>Doggie Playgroups</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18874</id><urlkey>dog-walks</urlkey><name>dog walks</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9753</id><urlkey>offleash</urlkey><name>Off Leash Dog Recreation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18340</id><urlkey>dog-play-groups</urlkey><name>Dog Play Groups</name></topics_item></topics><name>Ellen Barry</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>21224911</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Marshfield</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/21224911</link><visited>1326060885000</visited><lon>-70.74</lon></member>
