 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 What we're doing &lt;br /&gt;

 The plan is to bushwhack Mt Nancy (3926’) and Mt Bemis (3725’) in the White Mountains. This is 11 miles up and back hike with 3000 ft of elevation gain. Mt Nancy is on the New England Hundred Highest List and both Nancy and Mt Bemis are on the New Hampshire Hundred Highest List. &lt;br /&gt;

 This hike is intermediate (~1.5 mph). Depending on conditions, the trails and bushwhack route might be icy, slushy, packed out, or new powder, so please be prepared. Snowshoes with traction and microspikes/hillsounds are REQUIRED on this hike (see below). I'd like to complete this hike within 10 hours, however, it may take longer if trail and bushwhack conditions are not good. Prior winter hiking experience is required. Previous bushwhacking experience is also strongly recommended, although not required. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at the Nancy Pond Trail Parking Lot Trailhead on Rt 302 at 8:30 am. We will hike up the Nancy Pond Trail to the Nancy Pond and hike up the Mt Nancy Herd Path and Slide to Mt Nancy. From there, we will decide, based on weather, snow conditions, and safety considerations, whether to continue bushwhacking to Mt Bemis or turnaround and hike out. At Mt Bemis, we have the option to retrace out steps and hike back to Mt Nancy and then back the way we came or hike south from the Mt Bemis summit and back to the Nancy Pond trail further along and reducing our overall mileage. &lt;br /&gt;

 We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if you are a slow rather than a moderate hiker and expect us to constantly wait for you. &lt;br /&gt;

 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 Weather &lt;br /&gt;

 Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two ahead of time. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

 Clothing, Gear, Equipment, and Supplies &lt;br /&gt;

 Below is a list describing the minimum required items to participate in this event. Hiking safely is about being prepared so that you can respond to an emergency situation or spend a night in the woods if you have to. Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Footwear: Waterproof and Insulated winter hiking boots with synthetic or wool socks. Gaiters to keep the snow out of your boots. Mountaineering snowshoes with aggressive teeth for traction while climbing. Kahtoola Microspikes or Hillsound Crampons are acceptable for this trip. Since we won't be using these items all of the time either have space in your pack or a way to secure them to the outside of it. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Clothing: Dress in synthetics, fleece, and/or wool layers to easily regulate body temperature. Make sure your layers fit comfortably over each other. DO NOT WEAR COTTON - while cotton is a great insulator when it is dry, once wet it doesn't dry easily and it rapidly draws heat away from the body. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Eye Protection: Eye protection is recommended for bushwhacking, either corrective lenses or construction safety glasses available at a hardware store. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Outerwear: Insulated jacket with a hood. Windproof/waterproof shell (with hood) and waterproof shell pants. Make sure your outerwear fits comfortably over all of your other clothing. Fleece/wool hat, balaclava or face shield, neck warmer, and glove liners. Windproof/waterproof over-mittens. Goggles. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Food and Water: Bring high-energy snacks, food for lunch - pack extra "just in case". Bring enough water to stay properly hydrated during the trip - use insulated wide-mouth bottles instead of a hydration bladder since the mouthpiece/tube can freeze. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Shelter: Be prepared to spend a night in the woods if you have to. Options include an ultralight tarp, a bivy sack, or an emergency space blanket which packs small and weighs just ounces. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Other Essential Gear: Map and compass – these are required for this hike along with an ability to use them. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries - lithium work best in colder temperatures. Trekking poles for snowshoeing. Personal first aid kit with an emergency space blanket. Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Matches or wind-proof lighter and fire starter. Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Sunglasses. Waterproof cover for your pack. &lt;br /&gt;

 • Optional Items: Camera &lt;br /&gt;

 •&lt;/p&gt;
