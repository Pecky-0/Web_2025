Pyre by Dwight Kemper Roman M. Pyre made a big splash in the publishing industry with his gossip rag, &amp;#147;Confidentially&amp;#148;. Now Mr. Pyre has made another big splash. On the sidewalk after a plunge from a high rise apartment window. Did he fall or was he pushed? We have as suspects: two gossip columnists, a lawyer, a publishing magnate and his wishy washy son, and a movie star. Into the fray steps a ham actor and his female partner, who are hired to help them all with their alibi.
