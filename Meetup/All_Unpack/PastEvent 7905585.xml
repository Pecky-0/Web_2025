When you RSVP, please tell us whether you can offer people rides. If you can offer rides, please also mention (a) how many rides you can offer, and (b) where people would need to meet you to get a ride. Also please mention whether you have a rope and/or a rack of quickdraws that you can bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How its going to work: Rumney is pretty much all lead climbing! Most routes can be top-roped after someone else has led it, but few of the cliff tops can be accessed by trail. If you haven't led yet, please be willing to give it a shot! Rumney can also be very crowded, and smaller groups of climbers can often get in much more climbing than larger groups. Ideally, we'll arrange carloads of people who (a) know and trust each other, (b) collectively have all the gear and skills they need to climb, and (c) can climb together all day long (so no one accidentally gets left behind!). If you are brand-new to the meetup, please contact me before RSVPing to this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise at Rumney this Saturday is at 5:27am, which means it'll probably be warm enough to climb by 9am. I'd like to get there around then, which means leaving Boston around 7am. The weather looks good for Saturday, so it will be crowded at Rumney; some crags will be as crowded as Tuesday night at the gym! So the sooner we get there, the more climbing we can get in before the crowds overwhelm us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to bring: your personal climbing gear (harness, belay device, shoes, helmet if you have one), a rope and rack, if you have them, food and water for the day, $$$ for your share of gas, and possibly for dinner afterwards. It may be a bit chilly still when we first get there. Be prepared for that, and dress in layers. The approach trails are short, but often steep and dirty, so wear hiking boots if you think you'll need them. I'll be wearing my trail runners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use the commenting system here to arrange your carpools! I realize this could turn into a logistical disaster, so I'm limiting it to 10 RSVPs for the time being. Assuming everything's working out, I'll expand that limit as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and by the way: I need a ride! I can bring two ropes and a full rack of quickdraws.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hopefully we'll have driven up together!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210677096000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Rumney is hands-down the best sport climbing area anywhere near Boston, and arguably the best east of the Mississippi.
