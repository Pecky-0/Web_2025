&lt;strong&gt;Raj Kapoor and the Golden Age of Indian Cinema&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a director, producer and star, Raj Kapoor (1924-88) became one of India’s leading filmmakers during the so-called “golden age” of Indian cinema in the first two decades following the nation’s independence in 1947. Kapoor is in some ways a lynchpin, a Janus figure, with one face looking back to the aspirations of the era of independence and the other toward the present state of star-driven Hindi cinema with its mass appeal and global audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie we will see is &lt;strong&gt;Aag (Fire)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an apprenticeship at the important studio Bombay Talkies, Kapoor took the remarkable step of beginning his own production company at the age of twenty-four. His first film as director and producer starred himself as a young man haunted by a lost childhood love and willing to risk disinheritance by becoming a stage actor instead of becoming a lawyer like his father. &lt;em&gt;Aag&lt;/em&gt; finds Kapoor already employing the baroque shadows that would become the signature style of his black-and-white films as a director. This use of chiaroscuro reveals his apprenticeship at Bombay Talkies, whose leaders had received training at Germany’s fabled Ufa studio before the war&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we go after to talk depends on how many of us show up and the weather.  Possibilities are:  Grafton Street Pub, Pamplona, Charlies for outdoor cuisine.  Looking forward to learning more about movies in India. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
