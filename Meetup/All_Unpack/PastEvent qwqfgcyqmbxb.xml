&lt;p&gt;This is a group for those who already have an idea and may or may not have started, or for those who have a finished piece but need to refine it. The group's primary aim is to offer support for the writing process in a informal and friendly atmosphere. We offer feedback, but we are not about ripping somebody's work to shreds and bruising their confidence, that's the job of literary agents and publishers once your work is finished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership fees are $12 a year. Members can either pay for the whole year in advance or every six months. Membership fees are due either one month from when you join or at the end of your first meeting, whichever comes first. Members who do not pay their fees will be removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please click on the $12.00 a year link under membership dues for further details.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Daniel</member_name><member_id>6245807</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348120079000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fiction Book Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>earon-90</urlname><id>443052</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>The first time book writers club for non-professionals</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342056979000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The first time book writers club for non-professionals</name><id>qwqfgcyqmbxb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348009200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/earon-90/events/72985362/</event_url></item>
