&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curious about WordPress and how it can help you build and manage a better blog or website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a state-of-the-art web publishing platform, developed by hundreds of community volunteers and used by over 25 million people. Best of all, WordPress is free! With thousands of themes and plug-ins available on the web, anyone can launch a feature-rich website in minutes. First, you will learn the fundamentals of how WordPress works, how to get it up and running, and how to start publishing content immediately. Then we will explore the Administrator's Dashboard, including how to organize your content and configure certain features &amp;amp; behaviors of your site. Finally, you will learn how to install themes and plug-ins to alter the appearance of your site and add additional functionality for improved social integration, search engine optimization, and backup/security. (Note: We will be working with the self-hosted version of WordPress at &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;http://wordpress.org&lt;/a&gt;, not the hosted service at &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://wordpress.com"&gt;http://wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: $60&lt;/p&gt;
