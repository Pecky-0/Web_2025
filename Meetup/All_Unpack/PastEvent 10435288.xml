Block Island has a brand new terminal building that we need to check out.  We could go to town and find a nice restaurant on the water to dine at. Any preferences on where to go? What a great way to start off the summer. This is a very nice easy trip 83.6 NM.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't forget to ask your loved one or a friend to join you. Your not going to want to miss this one and don't forget the camera.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep your Wednesday nights free...thats Fly-out night!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KBID" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273544541000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242619757000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner on the Block?</name><id>10435288</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243459800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/10435288/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/f/global_8683375.jpeg</photo_url></item>
