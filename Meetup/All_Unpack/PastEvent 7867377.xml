Audubon's Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary in Topsfield on the evening of May 10th. Weather permitting, folks will get to look at the night sky through the telescopes of a local astronomy club. I will try to bring along one of my telescopes. If you would like to attend, you &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; preregister with the sanctuary. You can find more details here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/catalog.php?code=939-IP08SP1&amp;amp;sancName=Ipswich%20River&amp;amp;getresults=long" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massaudubo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that a nominal fee of $5/person is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a great program for kids. But there is a lot for adults to take away from the experience, too. Keep in mind that the lecture part of the program runs rain, clouds, or starshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, you must contact the sanctuary if you want to attend. The phone number at the sanctuary is 978-887-9264. Their office is closed on Mondays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to come, leave an RSVP so that I know who from the group is in the audience. I can also then send you detailed directions. Best to arrive by about 7:15 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll enjoy it, though I am a bit biased. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the sanctuary barn.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210635662000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Because you love the night sky.</why><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209861978000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Astronomy Lecture and Stargazing</name><id>7867377</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210462200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/7867377/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/0/6/global_4007638.jpeg</photo_url></item>
