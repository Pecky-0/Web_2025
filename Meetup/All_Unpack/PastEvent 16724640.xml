&lt;p&gt;Ken's latest talk will be entitled "Archaeological Odysseys: The 50 Sites in the United States You Should See Before You Die"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says this about the talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In his work, The Go Between, English novelist L.P. Hartley phrased it this way: &amp;ldquo;The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;Following this metaphor, in a sense, an important goal of every archaeologist is to serve as a tour guide to non-archaeologists who hope to visit the &amp;ldquo;foreign country&amp;rdquo; that is the past. In this lecture, I'll attempt to serve as your tour guide and direct you to at least some of the 50 sites that I think are the most important and the most interesting for you to experience first hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with a half hour of coffee and conversation at 7:30 p.m. and the main talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
