Do you offer samples/assessments of your product or service but then your prospect has to &amp;quot;think about it&amp;quot; before buying? What percentage of people that you market to take advantage of your free offers and what percentage become on going clients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling your marketing activities is only half of the revenue equation; your sales process being the other half. Once a prospect is &amp;quot;interested&amp;quot;, how do you move them along your sales pipeline and convert them into purchasing your products or services? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not able to convert enough prospects into a paying clients, come be inspired and rejuvenated with practical advise on how to keep more people in your sales funnel until they are ready to buy and how to motivate more people to actually buy from you sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becky Castro, CPCC, PCC has been a certified personal and business coach for the last 10 years.
