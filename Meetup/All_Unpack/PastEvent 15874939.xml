La Prossima Serata avra luogo da Mozzicato mercoledi il 12 gennaio alle 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non voglio darvi fastidio, ma devo scrivere un po in inglese.  For 2011, let's try to have regularly schedule meetups.  I am suggesting the second wednesday at Mozzicato in Hartford and the fourth wednesday at Mezzaluna in wallingford.  PLease note that there are five wednesdays in March, June, August and September, so four times a year there will be a three week gap instead of a two week gap.  Not a bad time to schedule a house party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of that, Becky (prompted by Marjo I believe) has proposed a series of pot-luck suppers and has offered to host the first one at her house on Saturday Feb 5.  Let's talk about it on the 12th and if you are receptive - and the offer is still open - we can put it on the schedule.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A presto,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>john delnegro</member_name><member_id>4845360</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294881276000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Amici Italiani</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-452</urlname><id>535327</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293897636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>serata di caffe' e conversazione</name><id>15874939</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294876800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-452/events/15874939/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/f/5/global_5243621.jpeg</photo_url></item>
