Don't miss a chance to take your Pug to play with all of his buddies in Shar's yard - the Pugs can run so far they actually disappear in the distance, and it's completely fenced and mowed flat so that your wildly galloping Pug doesn't stub his toe on a dandelion.  That yard is huge!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it's true, most of the Pugs sit around in a circle next to the folding chairs and wait for food to drop...  but there is room to run.  If you have the kind of Pug that sits on the window sill keeping an eye out for burglars and runs back and forth on the back of the couch barking at nothing, this is the venue for you.  Your crazy Pug will sleep for hours when he gets home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of parking available.  Please bring folding chairs.  The group has grown big enough so that there probably won't be enough resident chairs to go around...   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodies and fluids will be provided.  DO NOT FEED CLOVIS!  He has a damaged brain stem and has trouble swallowing.  Imagine a Pug who has trouble swallowing!  (Okay, you can feed him bits of soft food broken into tiny pieces... are you happy now, Clovis?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetup is on the SECOND Sunday of July.  See you then! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The June 2007 meetup was very well attended.  Please try to RSVP, if only for the sake of the hostess!   About 20 people send they were coming, and about 30 people and 40 Pugs showed up!  With Pugs, it's always the more the merrier, so we were delighted.  This time, Sharon had name tags available for all of our members and guests.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon provided her magical liver Bow-wow-wownies for the Pugs this meetup, so the Pugs spent a lot of time hanging out under the food table, hoping and praying for a friendly stranger.  We are pleased to report that Sharon was able to find an excellent home for her little rescue Pug Randall, and his new mommie and her other Pug were there also.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful time was had by all, and we hope you will be able to attend the next meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184090596000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181502157000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug July Meetup</name><id>5875843</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183917600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5875843/</event_url></item>
