So far it looks very elegant, quite peaceful and well organized. It would be so cool to gab a whole group of us, maybe 10 or 15 of us. This would be a great chance to meet other females in boston who have the same interest and also for girls who are new to boston. I don't know when a good date would be but hopefully next weekend sounds good. Let me know if anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love&lt;/p&gt;
