From the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"MINUTE MAN NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK&lt;/strong&gt; is located 22 miles outside of Boston within the towns of Lexington, Lincoln and Concord, Massachusetts. The park commemorates the opening battles of the American Revolution on April 19, 1775 by protecting, preserving and interpreting the significant historic sites, structures, landscapes, events and ideas embodied by these events. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 On April 19, 1775, British soldiers and American militia, "minute men" met in a series of skirmishes along a 22 mile stretch of road that ran from Boston to Concord. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The story of Minute Man is more than just the events that took place at Lexington Green, Concord's North Bridge, or along the Battle Road in 1775. Minute Man encompasses the story of an evolution of the ideals of freedom and liberty, new notions of cultural independence and citizen responsibility. These ideals led to an American literary revolution the following century, introducing Concord authors, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, Louisa May Alcott and Ralph Waldo Emerson. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The ideals of both the American Revolution and 19th Century literary revolution continue today and serve as an inspiration to people throughout the world."&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353967971000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348339843000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Minute Man National Historic Park</name><id>83606452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353771000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/83606452/</event_url></item>
