&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its the Saturday before Valentines Day and that special someone hasn't asked you out or for the guys, the supermodel just has not returned your phone call. Do not fret, old FAN Alliance has a solution. Its called a Chocolate Buffet. We will have a meet and greet, lots of chocolate and games, some party games, some stategy games. There should be a little something for everyone. If this does not describe you and you are planning to celebrate on the real Valentines Day, come on over anyway! This is a potluck, so bring over your favorite main dish, appetizer or dessert with some chocolate in it. I will email directions to those who RSVP YES.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362008680000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359304186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fourth Annual Valentines Chocolate Potluck: Meet, Greet &amp; Games</name><id>101614802</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361660400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/101614802/</event_url></item>
