I know it's short notice, but maybe a few of you can join me.  A nice atmosphere, fresh ingredients done well if a little differently than &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; thai.  Your standard favorites may not be exactly what you expect as the spices and are a little different but it's always quite good!   Here is a website for YELP that has reviews  &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-palace-bloomfield" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Ethnic Dining &amp;quot;Rules&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; you are expected to SHOW UP!!! Be polite and make sure you change your RSVP by 1:00pm THE DAY BEFORE if need be. If you have to cancel or want to add yourself at the last minute call the restaurant to let them know &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Please bring cash, it is so much quicker and easier. Remember, no one leaves until the bill is paid - this is respect for the event's host and the other diners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I will collect $1.00 from each participant for Meetup fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) This is a great group, we have a wonderful time at these events so let's keep the Organizer happy - come make me smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation:  Ethnic Dining/ Betsy</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy</member_name><member_id>3384225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269644701000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269109932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thai Palace 03/24/10 7:00pm</name><id>12941448</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269471600000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/12941448/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
