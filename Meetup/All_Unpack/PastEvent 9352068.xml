<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt;  Different location this month!  This monthly meeting will be held at Jill's house in Watertown.  It's about 35-40 minutes from the Hartford area.  It's pretty easy to find ....not too far off route 8.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address is 51 Bruce Street.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for our monthly potluck fiesta! Meet new friends who share your interest in improving or maintaining language skills. This (mostly) Spanish conversation fiesta takes place this month at a private home in&lt;span style="color: limegreen"&gt; Watertown&lt;/span&gt;. Bring a SMALL amount of food to share. If you can, let us know in your RSVP what you'll bring.  Hope to see you there! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jill</member_name><member_id>849732</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233016194000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229516823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Spanish Language January Meetup</name><id>9352068</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232496000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/9352068/</event_url></item>
