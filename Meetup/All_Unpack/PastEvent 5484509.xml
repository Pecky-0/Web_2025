It's been quite some time since our last meetup event!  Our apologies.  We have been quite busy, so please bear with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought we'd try it this time at one of the regular salsa spots.  There will be a rueda classes with JAM'NASTICS and Salsa Classes with Johnny of Salsa y Control and Kelly.  Feel free to attend the classes for only $2 more, or join us for the party for only $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Notice!  There WILL be a performance by Masacote Dance Company, which will be debuting the latest choreography this evening, never seen before!  (There was a mistake in Olaf's last newsletter which originally stated it would take place on Valentine's Day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The schedule is included below.  Hope to see you guys there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ana &amp;amp; the Salsa Meetup Staff :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8pm: Casino Rueda Lessons with Jam'Nastics, all levels&lt;br /&gt;9pm: Salsa with Johnny and Kelly, beginner and intermediate levels&lt;br /&gt;10pm-1am: Salsa Dance with DJ Hernan, DJ D.
