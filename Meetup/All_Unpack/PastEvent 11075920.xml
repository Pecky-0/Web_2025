Be Ready to Swim at 7:15am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5.00 for parking (Cash only, machine takes $5's &amp;amp; $10's. but not $20s). Walden Pond Parking is on the left coming from Rte 2.  The entrance to Walden Pond is about 30 yards past the parking lot entrance on the right. Walk down the hill and there's the beach! Meet down at the beach along the wall across from the bike racks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wetsuits recommended but I've seen people swimming without them as well, might be a little chilly at first but definitely swimmable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to swim across &amp;amp; back (~1 mile roundtrip). Walden Pond map is in the file section of this website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swim shorter or longer as you please.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet down at the beach along the wall across from the bike racks</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim</member_name><member_id>9300886</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250855364000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249907076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swim The Great Walden Pond</name><id>11075920</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250334000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/11075920/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/4/3/global_9514163.jpeg</photo_url></item>
