Tell all your friends!Most felt good enough to hike at a moderately strenuous pace. So we will hike at a moderately strenuous pace. We can start at the South side of the Skyline Trail, hike up to Elliot Tower, take the Red Dot Trail, then back down to the Headquarters on the North Side of the Skyline Trail. I think route had the most incline. If people prefer we take the same route as the last time (North side first then down the South side) let me know. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

According to one website, "The classic here is the Skyline Trail (blue blazes), from Quincy going West via Houghton's Pond to the summit of Great Blue Hill, and back to Houghton's Pond. This is about nine miles long, with an elevation gain (my calculations, people disagree about the numbers) of 2,500 feet." - &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ellozy/strenuous.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://home.earthlink.net/~ellozy/strenuous.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

START TIME/LOCATION: Starting promptly at 11:30 - Houghton's Pond, Milton, Ma, address listed is for the Headquarters which is a 100 feet from the Houghton's Pond parking. There is more parking available at the Houghton's Pond parking area (I will be parked here). &lt;br /&gt;
