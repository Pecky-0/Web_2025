Also, since Rob does not charge us for using the facility I encourage you to take advantage of a meetup discount while there for any of your frenchie needs They also have a wonderful grooming area so you may want to make an appointment while you are there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll have the doggie bags!
