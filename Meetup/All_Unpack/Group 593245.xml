This group is meant as a vehicle for libertarians in the greater Boston area to meet and socialize. Join us and share your opinions on today's political climate and issues. If you're a Bostonian who is unsure who libertarians are, this is the place to come to find out. Everyone interested in libertarianism is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you want to contribute politically, this Meetup group works with the Boston area chapter of the LPMA. Details will be available at the meetings for the activist bent. In the meantime, you can visit us online at http://www.lpmass.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston Area Libertarian Meetup Group is funded by the Libertarian Association of Massachusetts, and does not endorse any candidate for the United States Presidential nomination.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.59</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1185761834000</created><lat>42.3499984741</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>99</id><urlkey>libertarian</urlkey><name>Libertarian</name></topics_item></topics><name>The Boston Area Libertarian Meetup Group</name><id>593245</id><members>336</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>4297517</member_id><name>Dave</name></organizer><urlname>libertarian-349</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/b/c/600_1809660.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/b/c/highres_1809660.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>1809660</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/b/c/thumb_1809660.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/libertarian-349/</link><lon>-71.0699996948</lon></item>
