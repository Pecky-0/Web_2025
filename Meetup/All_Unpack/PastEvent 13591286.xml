Use the time to work on your ATCs for swaps in June or anything else you want. We always have fun at these smaller Meetups; sign up now to join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAY/TIME:&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, May 30, from 1 p.m. to ???? (Really, we'll stay as late as anybody wants to stay!) Come for an hour or two; come for the whole day. And yes, we know it's Memorial Day weekend, but this is a chance to take a little break from holiday stuff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AGENDA:&lt;/b&gt; No scheduled activities. Arrive and leave when you want. Work on your own projects at your own pace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/b&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST&lt;/b&gt;: $10 to help defray the Studio rental costs. (ArtStudio 360 renters attend free.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/b&gt; Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/b&gt; Your own materials and projects to work on (just as you do for the regular Meetup). But basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use. Even if you show up empty-handed, we can get you started on projects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/b&gt; RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function so we know who's coming and how many to expect. Please RSVP for your guests as well. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly so that someone can take your place. Please do this right up to the start time for the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/b&gt; If we need to cancel due to weather or any reason--or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot; So please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Oh, they'll figure it out.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275416976000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274809139000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special NE ATC+ Meetup: May 30th Open Studio </name><id>13591286</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275238800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/13591286/</event_url></item>
