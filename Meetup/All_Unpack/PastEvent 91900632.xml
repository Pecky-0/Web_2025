&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://olivedelmondo.com/"&gt;Olive del Mondo&lt;/a&gt; has been open just a few months and offers an incredibly diverse selection of distinctive olive oils and vinegars that would make any chef's mouth water. Everything from black and white truffle, to walnut and almond oils can be had, in addition to an incredible variety of fruit-infused dark  and spicy, fruit-infused white balsamic vinegars.  Besides being able to purchase a bottle of whatever tantalizes your taste buds, (which you can bring back to refill - a nice, non-wasteful touch), they also have a variety of sampler packs and gift baskets, pestos, spreads, jams, confits, gourmet salts and spices. Whether you're looking for something to jazz up your daily dishes, a hostess/host or holiday gift, this is really the place to check out first, You won't be sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will be staying open &lt;strong&gt;just for us&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, December 4th 6:00-7:30pm&lt;/strong&gt; and showing us ways of using vinegar and oils we've never thought of! Balsamic vinegar on ice cream? Clear balsamic in soda water? Who knew?! All I know is I want to try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've probably driven, walked or biked past the store before and wondered, really? Olive oil and vinegar, what's so great about that? I thought the same until Emily Harris dragged me in one day when we were walking by and I actually TRIED it. It was awesome! No joke. So we're going to do a tasting and check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be limited to 30, so sign up now! ALSO, &lt;a href="http://olivedelmondo.com/"&gt;Olive del Mondo&lt;/a&gt; is generously offering us a PlusPerk through &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://collectiveplus.com"&gt;collectiveplus.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;15% off any oil, vinegars or sampler packs purchased that night, so sign up NOW on &lt;a href="http://www.collectiveplus.com"&gt;collectiveplus.com&lt;/a&gt; to get it!&lt;/strong&gt; Click the link in the "Our Sponsors" section in the left column of this page or click the link above.
