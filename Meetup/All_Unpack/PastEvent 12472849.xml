See more details below about dinner.&lt;br /&gt;If you are skipping dinner and meeting us at the performance, go to the ticket booth, tell them you are with Jacki Rose's group and buy your ticket for $20.  Find your seat and we will be there.  Seats are assigned and we are all together. If you need to contact me, my cell# is 508-381-1529&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have arranged a very special deal with Claflin Hill to get almost 50% off the regular ticket price.  Cost is only $20 per person.  (Regular price is $35) You may pay when you arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sacred and the Profane!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mozart Requiem &lt;br /&gt;Carl Orff Carmina Burana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the greatest chorus-and-orchestra masterpieces of the entire literature! Mozart’s noble, majestic and elegiac Requiem paired with Orff’s colorful bacchanal of student drinking songs and romance! Carmina Burana was the first work ever performed by the CHSO in May, 2000 – the Mozart Requiem opened the first full season! A musical feast with a one-two punch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet at the Town Hall parking lot on Court Street at 5:45 pm.&lt;/b&gt;  We'll walk to the Turtle Tavern casual/affordable pub, located at 72 Main Street.  If you arrive after 5:45, meet us over there.  It's just one block up on the same side of the street as the Town Hall.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in Town Hall parking lot at 5:45 on Court Street.
