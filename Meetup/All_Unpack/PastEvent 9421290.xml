If you made a New Years resolution to work out, you've come to the right place. Not only will you get a workout, but you'll have a lot of fun. We are very casual, so skill level does not matter. We have a wide range of players that come every week. The field is turf, so even there is snow its very nice to play on. I'm pretty sure it will be cold Saturday, so just layer up and come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The field is very close to the Alewife Redline T stop. Just follow signs to Rindge Ave and look for the park across the Alewife Brook Pkwy. The field is next to all of the baseball fields and you'll see a fieldhouse right next to the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231607909000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230855096000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT - FLAG FOOTBALL - NOON - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>9421290</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231002000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/9421290/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
