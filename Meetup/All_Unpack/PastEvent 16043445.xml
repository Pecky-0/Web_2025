Congressman Guinta had told me he wanted to meet with our group within the first 60 days of him being seated and he is doing just that.  Come and hear what our new Congressman is doing and hearing in DC.  This is a great opporitunity and bring a friend.  We have had non members recording these events and no recordings will be permitted unless approved by the organizer Jerry DeLemus prior to the meeting.  NHGOP Chairman Jack Kimball will be coming to this meeting to say thanks to all of you for all of your hard work on his campaign for NHGOP Chair.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jerry DeLemus</member_name><member_id>9270878</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297725092000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rochester-912-project</urlname><id>1452537</id><group_lat>43.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>Rochester 912 Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294972104000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Congressman Frank Guinta and NHGOP Chairman Jack KimballSpecial Meeting</name><id>16043445</id><headcount>100</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296516600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rochester-912-project/events/16043445/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/5/c/global_13852444.jpeg</photo_url></item>
