We'd like to give you another chance at it. Meet at Parking Lot #2 off Upper College Pond Road (where we meet for the Bentley Loop hikes). We'll shuttle over to park off Circuit Road. I don't have the exact mileage but we were out a little less than two hours and that included an off-trail exploration of a small lightning strike fire site and stopping to listen to highly unusual bird calls (which Peter's friend swears were mourning doves but I'm not so sure). The hike also passes the area where group members have been building birdhouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Bescherer</member_name><member_id>650729</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>8840771</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284214583000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281709043000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Does lightning strike twice?
