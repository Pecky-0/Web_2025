&lt;p&gt;This is a meditation session, and an introduction to the Art of Living course, meant to bring people together for a few moments of perfect tranquility in the heart of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us as we explore the subtle Mind-Breath-Body connection, and understand the ways in which we can consciously use our breath to manage our stress, minds and emotions, and ways in which we can be more aware and present. We will also hang around over some tea, post. These sessions are being offered by the Art of Living Foundation, a non-profit organization engaged in service initiatives across 153 countries. So, come, empty your minds, and rejuvenate mid week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No meditation experience required, all are welcome. Please RSVP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring your picture ID &amp;amp; check in at the visitor desk on the First Floor for the "Art of Living meeting"&lt;/p&gt;
