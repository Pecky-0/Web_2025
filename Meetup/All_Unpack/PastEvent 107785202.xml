But if you know why the language is the way it is, perhaps you will at least understand the thinking that led to a particular wart. In this session, you can talk with one of the original "gang of 6" who decided on the features of Java during the first decade of the language's existence. Come ask about your least favorite (or favorite) feature in Java, and hear the history of the inclusion or evolution of that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Waldo was a distinguished engineer with Sun Microsystems until Sun was acquired by Oracle. He started using Java before it was called Java, was part of the first engineering review of the Java language, and was a member of the gang of six who decided on all of the features added to the language between Java 1.1 and Java 1.5. He is the author of Java: The Good Parts (O'Reilly), and is currently the CTO and Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Science for Harvard University .&lt;/p&gt;
