We will be meeting next to the parking lot of Sleeping Giant and starting out as close to 11:30 am as possible. I'm not sure if they are charging for parking yet so it might be a few dollars to park or there is parking on the road before you turn in to the lot. See you tomorrow, Andrea **** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spring is finally here and it is time to start hiking again!!! Come to Sleeping Giant for the first the spring hikes -- and, knowing this group, just the first of many.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping Giant has paths ranging from relatively easy to very difficult. I am interested in doing one of the tough hikes (White or Blue trial) but if some people want to do an easier one we can have groups on different trails. We've done that before and usually end up meeting at the castle or for lunch after. Feel free to post your preference in your RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's too early to know what the weather will be like that day so check back when it gets closer. If it rains that day, I'll probably reschedule the hike for the next weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Sleeping Giant parking lot at 11:30 am. There may be a fee for parking so groups may want to arrange carpools. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact is Andrea 203-641-8083&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177529543000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175049979000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sat 4/07 -- Hike at Sleeping Giant</name><id>5611808</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175959800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5611808/</event_url></item>
