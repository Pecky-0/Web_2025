&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Facebook page, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/201538896531714/" class="linkified"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/201538896531714/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am inviting one and all to the 3rd Steampunk Invasion of Salem. Last year the invasion was a great success and loads of fun. So this year I am starting the planning early. To top it off I have gathered some great creative minds to help plan an even greater event for this year!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This is a free Event. &lt;br /&gt;

 The date: Saturday Sept 8th 2012. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be starting the event on Pickering Wharf 12pm to 6pm &lt;br /&gt;

 We will have Vendors and Entertainment. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 A few public service announcements. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We want to make sure that the people who live on the wharf (yes people live there) and the stores enjoy our company. We also want the city to like us.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please treat everyone steampunk and non steamy with respect. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please treat the area we have been given kindly, and do not litter. &lt;br /&gt;

 We are portraying ourselves as Neo-Victorian and the like. So remember our Manners. &lt;br /&gt;

 There is Parking on the Wharf, The stores may like it if we left the spots open for business. Please be courteous and leave the spaces open. &lt;br /&gt;

 The Wharf is an active street. So please no congregating in the road. It is not kind nor safe to block traffic. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ***IMPORTANT***  &lt;br /&gt;

 Some notes on Pickering Wharf: &lt;br /&gt;

 * Parking on Pickering Wharf is FREE, but the spaces fill up early and there is a loose 2 hour limit. There is a parking garage on the next corner and another 2 blocks away (where Darq will be at the end of the night!) DO NOT park in the Condo spaces. &lt;br /&gt;

 * There are no trash cans on Pickering Wharf. Please, if you plan to picnic, remember it is "carry in, carry out". &lt;br /&gt;

 * The Public Restrooms are located at the National Park Service (Between Capts Restaurant and The Friendship.)  &lt;br /&gt;

 * Please, be kind to the Merchants and Residents of the Wharf! Yes, people live there... this is their home. We want to be invited back next year! &lt;br /&gt;

 * ENJOY. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
