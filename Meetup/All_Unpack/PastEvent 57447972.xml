&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Our anniversary meeting will be April 9, the second Monday instead of our usual third Monday of the month. Also, please bring a dish to share. An anniversary cake will be provided!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're honored to have author, educator, and television personality Ken Feder as our anniversary speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken says about this talk: "Having been a talking head for a number of television documentaries over the course of the last few years, in 2009 I naively accepted the request for an on-air interview by an independent production company for a video focused on what they called "North America's ancient lost civilizations." I thought the video's intent was to illuminate the archaeological record of America's indigenous societies. Instead, the documentary presented what was effectively a fundamentalist Mormon view of history in which the mound building societies of the American midwest were not Native Americans but, instead, ancient wandering Hebrews. If you have ever trusted television documentaries, this story will convince you to be far more skeptical of both the process and the result."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with a pot-luck dinner at 7:30 p.m. The talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334077296000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332444679000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anniversary Meeting: Dr. Ken Feder - Lost Civilizations and Lost Innocence</name><id>57447972</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334014200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/57447972/</event_url></item>
