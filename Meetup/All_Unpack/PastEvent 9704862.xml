Salter who, in partnership with Mr. Strong, founded the Salter and Strong paper mill, which became Lydall paper mill.  Many North End residents learned to swim at Salter’s Pond before the town swimming pool was built. In the 1950s, cows grazed in the meadow of the farm across the pond. Our walk will include some historic commentary. Meet in the parking lot of the town swimming pool on Lydall Street, east of the intersection with Coleman Road. The walk may be wet depending on the weather, and hikers should wear sturdy waterproof footwear. The route is not mountainous, but does have stairs and bumpy spots, where roots stick out, so participants need to be agile. No dogs, please. This moderately paced walk will take about 1-1/2 hours round trip. Phone hike leader Susan Barlow (860-643-9776) if questions. Why not wear something red for Valentine’s Day?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a blue back pack</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234808284000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234191063000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salter's Pond in Manchester moderate hike</name><id>9704862</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234634400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/9704862/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/8/global_7250680.jpeg</photo_url></item>
