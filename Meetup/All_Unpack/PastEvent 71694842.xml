<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Come on over for an impromptu picnic at Vanessa's in West Haven July 3rd starting at 4 PM. I am supplying set ups, and a few pick foods. This is a BYOE (bring your own everything). Anything you wish to cook, please bring it and a side dish to share! I have 2 grills! I am about a 20 minute walk to the beach. Thinking of heading to see the West Haven fireworks around 8:00 PM. We will be by the band if you can't make the picnic. After that, plan on a bonfire and smores back at my house..(or we can cook again)! If you don't know my address, please call 203.783.1811. Let's get together, relax and celebrate the Fourth of July Party Expess Style!! (please park across the street in the large parking lot. You can drive to the fireworks also. Traffic may be heavy though. Don't forget to drink and drive responsibly!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Vanessa</member_name><member_id>11653417</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341457790000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
