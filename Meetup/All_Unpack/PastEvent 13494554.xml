If she fails, Ree and her family will be turned out into the Ozark woods. Challenging her outlaw kin's code of silence and risking her life, Ree hacks through the lies, evasions and threats offered up by her relatives and begins to piece together the truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wintersbonemovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Winter's Bone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Winter’s Bone” is as serious as a snakebite, with a plot that seems tight enough to fit on the label of a package of chew. . . Daniel Woodrell’s seven previous novels, featuring a population scraped from the underbelly of Arkansas citizenry — even the children are often grotesqueries — arrive from a genre you might want to call “hillbilly noir.” In “Winter’s Bone,” he has hit upon the character of a lifetime. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like her 2004 debut feature, “Down to the Bone,” a vérité indie about an upstate New York mother trying to ditch her drug habit for the sake of her children, “Winter’s Bone” is a closely observed drama whose protagonist is a young woman scraping by in a decaying corner of America rarely visited by filmmakers who have not passed through the Sundance Screenwriters Lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Sarasota Film Festival:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debra Granik’s new film “Winter’s Bone” is not always easy to watch, but it is worth the effort, especially for the chance to appreciate the fine work of its young star Jennifer Lawrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s understandable why the film won the Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 19-year-old Lawrence is an actress to watch as she holds together a film that is part intense drama and part thriller set among poor neighbors in the Ozarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching Winter's Bone at the Independent Film Festival with Debra Granik in attendance felt similar to the experience of seeing &lt;u&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;/u&gt; at the HFA with Kathryn Bigelow.  The audiences were blown away by a film that, if it gets enough distribution, should be considered for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Ms. Granik could become the second female to win Best Director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is the real deal.  Filmed on location in a holler in the Ozark Mountains, the performances by the actors are as real as any you'll ever see, down to the dialect, wardrobe, and tics of meth addicts.  This film will leaves an indelible impression, and you might forget, in time, that it was a movie you watched, and not an actual memory of a visit to the Ozarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film, we'll go to a nearby eatery for decompression, depending on numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the movie.  And bring your dad.  Trust me, the fathers in this film make yours seem like The Greatest Dad in the World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for John holding a Meetup Sign in the lobby immediately following the film.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273963967000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter's Bone</name><id>13494554</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277066700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/13494554/</event_url></item>
