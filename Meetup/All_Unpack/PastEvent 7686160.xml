This time we are going to dive into &amp;quot;Water&amp;quot;, which I hear is an amazing and really moving film. I've included part of a review from Amazon.com below, which tells some of what it is about. We'll show the movie on our big screen, and have some snacks, and conversation about the movie afterward. Our regulars love movie night. If you haven't been to one, come on over and see what it's like!&lt;br /&gt;See you all there.&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Johanna &amp;amp; Rev. David&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Water&amp;quot; is the third film in writer/director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy, following &amp;quot;Fire&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Earth&amp;quot;. It explores the plight of widows in traditional Hindu culture, where women are condemned to a grim, rudimentary existence after their husbands die. Driven by characters as much as by its cause, this is not a bleak film. On the contrary, &amp;quot;Water&amp;quot; is breathtakingly beautiful. In India in 1938, young Chuyia (Sarala) is widowed at the age of 8. By religious law, when a man dies, his wife may either be cremated with him, marry his brother, or live the life of an ascetic -chaste, poor, and pious. Chuyia's head is shaved, her jewelry removed, and she is sent to live in an ashram with other widows of all ages. She is befriended by a pretty widow named Kalyani (Lisa Ray), watched over by the devout and generous Shakuntula (Seema Biswas), and often at odds with the ashram's callous matriarch Madhumati (Manorama), who pays the rent by prostituting Kalyani. A handsome law student with progressive politics, Narayan (John Abraham), is smitten by Kalyani. But it is sinful for widows to remarry, and Kalyani is a prostitute besides.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
