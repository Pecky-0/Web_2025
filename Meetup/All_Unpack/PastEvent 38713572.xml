<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The recently completed 4.3-mile Sweet Trail runs from Longmarsh Road in Durham to the shore of Great Bay in Newmarket. The area is crawling with beavers and the trail crosses about the longest active beaver dam you'll ever see! Ponds full of wildlife are everywhere and the area feels surprisingly remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trailhead&lt;/strong&gt;: From Durham, follow Rt 108 toward Newmarket a couple of miles to a left on Longmarsh Rd. &amp;nbsp;Follow Longmarsh to its end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time/Distance&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an easy and mostly flat but very scenic trail. If we followed the entire length, it would be 8.6 miles roundtrip. We don't have to hike that far and the group can decide if we should turn around before reaching Great Bay. &amp;nbsp;Figure on 2-4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please email me directly to ask before bringing pets!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get food and drinks afterward in Durham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nature Conservancy, the Town of Durham, and the Great Bay Resource Protection Partnership helped plan and develop the trail which highlights diverse wildlife habitats through the 2500 acre Crommet Creek watershed. The trail crosses land owned by NH Fish and Game, Society for the Protection of NH Forests, Town of Durham and The Nature Conservancy. &amp;nbsp;It was constructed with the help of local volunteers, New York City youth, and AMC trail crews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several picturesque overlooks and bridges along the trail offering views of beaver ponds and a great blue heron rookery. It is not unusual to see American black ducks, osprey, beaver, turtles and many songbirds along the trail. From freshwater marshes to tidal creeks, you will see the interconnections between fresh and saltwater habitats and the abundance of life that depends on these ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
