<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The largest conservation area in Newton is wooded, with noted rock outcroppings of Roxbury Puddingstone, brooks, ponds, wetlands, fields, and an historic woodland garden. Activities to enjoy here are walking, jogging, nature study, geology study, birding, rock climbing, and cross-country skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gooch's Caves - These are Roxbury Conglomerate fissure caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandstone Ledges - These thick ledges alternate with Roxbury Conglomerate rock. They are sandstone formations that may have been river deposits. You can see the evidence of ripple marks, such as are made by water. Note the very long, almost vertical joints toward the westerly end of the ledges. The ledges are located west of Hammond Pond Parkway and north of the MBTA track, off the southbound lane of the Parkway. Enter the pathway about 600' south of Beacon Street and see the ledges to the right of the path.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My vehicle: red jeep with big wheels</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6025746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327855884000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Subnats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>science-88</urlname><id>1005141</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Suburban Naturalists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327627183000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Webster Conservation Area</name><id>49803952</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327766400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/science-88/events/49803952/</event_url></item>
