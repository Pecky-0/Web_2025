Plan on walking 1-1.5 hours. The parking to the end and back is 4 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to dress in layers as it can be windy and cool along the beach. You may want to bring water as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested, we may grab a bite to eat at one of the great restaurants along the beach after our walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this event, please contact me. THANKS! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wollaston Beach Walk &lt;br /&gt;Thursday, May 20th @ 5:30 pm &lt;br /&gt;Caddy Memorial Park &lt;br /&gt;Quincy Shore Drive &lt;br /&gt;Quincy, MA &lt;br /&gt;(the park by the traffic light ACROSS the street from the beach) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer(s): Alison (let me know if anyone wants to co-organize) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: At least 3 Yes RSVPs by 8 pm on Wednesday, May 19th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attendance is unlimited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by 8 pm on Wednesday May 19th since I have no access to meetup.com at work.

All Yes RSVPs will be emailed by 9 pm Wednesday  5/19 if the event is canceled due to the weather. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;Directions to Caddy Memorial Park @ Wollaston Beach: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wollaston Beach can be accessed from many points. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to get to our meeting place is to get off 93N at Exit 8 (Furnace Brook Parkway), exit ramp rotary following small green sign for Furnace Brook Parkway, and follow Furnace Brook Parkway for 2.9 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furnace Brook Parkway ends at Wollaston Beach, and you take a left onto Quincy Shore Drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 0.2 (two-tenths) miles, our meeting place comes up on the left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parking lot for Caddy Park has a small footbridge and a flag poll that are visible from the main road. Look for the organizer there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274400026000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273343920000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evening walk at the Beach</name><id>13423810</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274391000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/13423810/</event_url></item>
