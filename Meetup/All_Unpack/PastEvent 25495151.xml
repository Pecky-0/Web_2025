  &lt;strong&gt;Be sure to read the entire event listing before you RSVP - then answer the questions that are part of the RSVP process. While the objective of this event is to enjoy ourselves, your safety, and the safety of the others, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands, overestimate your skills and abilities, or come unprepared you may put yourself and/or others at risk &amp;ndash; consider this before you decide to participate.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me for a mid-week 
&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;fast-paced&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; hike to Jennings Peak and Sandwich Dome. We will grab two peaks hiking ~13 miles with an elevation gain of ~3000 feet. Because of the pace and mileage I am going to classify this hike as a intermediate to advanced hike. Sorry this is not a beginner hike. Book time is ~ 10 hours, but I am hoping to do this hike in less than 7.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trail begins on route 49 and is 5.1 miles with an elevation change of 2500 feet to the junction of the Sandwich Mtn. Trail. At 1.1 mi. there's a nice cascade and pool on Smarts Brook, right next to the trail (we may hit this on our return to trip). This is a popular destination for a short, easy hike but we will continue on to the Sandwich Mountain trail to Jennings Peak spur trail and onto the summit. Jennings Peak (3460 ft.) offers wonderful views of the surrounding wilderness area and surrounding peaks. We will continue back the way we came and grab Sandwich Dome (3993 ft.). Sandwich Mountain is a beautiful mountain located just south of Waterville Valley, NH. If this peak was just twenty feet higher the mountain would be one of the most climbed peaks in the White Mountains. Even though Sandwich Mountain is not one of the 4000 footers in New Hampshire, the mountain is still a popular hike in the White Mountains and definite is worth a trip. On a clear day, one can view the Tripyramids , Mt. Osceola and Mt. Tecumseh from the summit. There are also great views from the sub-summits of Noon Peak and Jennings Peak. Jennings Peak has often been viewed as having better views than Sandwich Mountain. (RT mileage 13 mi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could alter our plans because of fatigue, weather, or other situations and there is no guarantee that we will complete the entire event as described here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests are not permitted - all participants must be members of the Random Group of Hikers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Clothing and Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list describing the minimum required clothing and equipment to participate in this event. DO NOT rely on others to have extra clothing or equipment to share with you once we are out on the trails. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Footwear: Sturdy hiking boots or trail shoes - no sneakers.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Clothing: Dress in layers to easily regulate body temperature. Wear synthetic shirt/pants and bring a fleece jacket/wool sweater (even in summer). ABSOLUTELY NO COTTON - while cotton is a great insulator when dry it doesn't dry easily and is a great conductor when wet.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Outerwear: Waterproof/windproof rain shell with hood.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Food and Water: High-energy snacks, food for lunch, and enough water to stay properly hydrated during the trip.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Other Essential Gear: Map and compass. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries. Personal first aid kit with an emergency space blanket (e.g. mylar). Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Sunglasses. Waterproof cover for your pack.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    Optional Items: Waterproof/windproof pants. Trekking poles. Camera.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From I-93 take exit 28 onto &amp;nbsp;Rt. 49 towards Waterville Ski Area. Smarts Brook Trailhead will be on your right on Rt. 49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While carpooling is encouraged you are responsible for coordinating your own rides. Use the comments section to communicate with others who may also be looking to share a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
