Thanks for everyone that played. Hopefully we can have more tournaments like that in the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this week we'll be playing again. Noontime on Saturday at Russell Field, just across the road from the Alewife T Stop. All skill levels can show up. We welcome all and play to have fun. It looks to be cold on Saturday, so bundle up. Don't worry though, once you start running around it feels much better. Just bring yourself, water, and gloves if you have them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you Saturday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229295992000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228349581000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT NOON - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>9275819</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228582800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/9275819/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
