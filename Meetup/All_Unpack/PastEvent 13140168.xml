As always, we are holding a family-friendly&lt;br /&gt;event, so bring your family and your friends.  We hope to see you&lt;br /&gt;there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also Tax Day Tea Parties taking place in Greenwich, New&lt;br /&gt;Haven, and Norwich.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT'S ABOUT LIBERTY! - SECOND ANNUAL TAX DAY TEA PARTY&lt;br /&gt;DAY: Thursday, April 15&lt;br /&gt;TIME: 2 PM to 4 PM&lt;br /&gt;PLACE: Hartford State Capitol, North Steps&lt;br /&gt;MAP/PARKING: &lt;a href="http://www.hartford.gov/parking/downloads/hartford_parking_map.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hartford.g...&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;The Civic Center garage (#1 on the map) may be your best bet; there is also metered parking around Bushnell Park, but check the meters carefully and note the time limits.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There will be tables, including one for CFL.
