&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Point Tavern!!! on Wickenden Street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Point Tavern is a cozy, warm bar complete with low lighting, booth and bar seating and a "grad" clientele. The Point is a great place to cozy up and hang out with friends, pop in for a quick drink after work or to meet a friend. Either way this is one you'll want to know about and you'll be back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One caveat - the drinks are great, but there's no food. HOWEVER, you can order from any fine Providence establishment for delivery, select from one of the restaurants along Wickenden Street and bring it in, OR if you like, bring something from home. Options abound! Duck &amp;amp; Bunny is right next store too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on dialing for dinner or opting for catering from Chez Elsbeth and planting myself for a few hours of social fun and good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy and NYE 2012!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're hard to miss!!!
