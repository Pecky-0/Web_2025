Here is a description from Herb: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Men share in a circle thoughts, feelings, needs, desires, praises and complaints about relating to women while women only listen (you are the fly on the wall) and vice versa. Questions can be asked after each circle. Hear what’s real and Herb will bring it together at the end. Party after.... bring vegetarian refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 pm – 9:00pm, party after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce has been leading men and women's groups and gender workshops for many years. He is a therapist, personal life coach and leads workshops on the Enneagram, communication skills, spiritual development and personal growth.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring our own food for dinner or to share as a snack as long as there is not any meat in it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274587284000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274326575000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Men and Women's Circle</name><id>13539509</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274565600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/13539509/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/8/global_7203288.jpeg</photo_url></item>
