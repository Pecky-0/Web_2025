Here are the details from Julie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Thursday will be a beautiful night and I thought it would be nice to go for a bike ride and then dinner. Let's bike along the mintueman trail. This cafe is right off of route 2 for those that are driving. We can bike for a while and then head back for dinner at Sweet Chilis, my favorite thai place in Arlington Center. Although it is casual, they have awesome thai food. Please email me until 4pm on Thursday with any questions. Please also note in your RSVP if you are in for dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/887/calendar/8581600/?a=nr1c_grp"&gt;http://socialnetwork....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219531332000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Leisure Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-235</urlname><id>527341</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Boston Leisure Bicycling</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219257070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>mintueman trail bike ride - joint event wtih social fun</name><id>8585227</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219357800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-235/events/8585227/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/1/global_1549089.jpeg</photo_url></item>
