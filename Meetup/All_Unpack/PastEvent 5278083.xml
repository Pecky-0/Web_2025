Let's have some ice breakers and get to know you time....Everyone's got a story to share, so let's listen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you're coming from Mass Pike...take ALLSTON/BRIGHTON Exit... pay toll, follow BRIGHTON sign.... road loops around and slightly merges on CAMBRIDGE ST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Cambridge St (pass HESS); pass over Harvard St (Sports Depot on right)... pass Allston Car wash (on left)... cross over N. Beacon St (this is major intersection - Twin Donuts will be on your right as you pass it...) Keep going straight....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass St Elizabeth's Hospital (on left - cambridge st is now washington street).... After hospital next major intersection is MARKET ST - TURN RIGHT..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoHo will be on the right (quickly) across from the Brooks drug store. Street parking should be available. There is also a parking lot on the right BEFORE soho at the Corrib Pub (i think you can park there too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a pretty straight shot from Pike..&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165671652000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163917416000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston/Brookline/MA Burbs Divorce Support December Meetup</name><id>5278083</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165449600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/5278083/</event_url></item>
