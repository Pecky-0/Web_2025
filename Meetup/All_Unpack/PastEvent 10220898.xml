The made-for-TV film, which stars Hank Azaria as Mitch Albom and Jack Lemmon as Morrie, won four Emmy awards, a Golden Globe award, and a Screen Actors Guild award. All are welcome to view the film and then join us for the book discussion from 3PM until 5PM. Both the film showing and the book discussion will be at USNH, 700 Hartford Turnpike in Hamden. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quotes from the book:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half asleep, even when they are busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In truth, there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You see, you closed your eyes. That was the difference. Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them too - Even when you're in the dark. Even when you're falling.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. and you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From reviews of &amp;quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&amp;quot;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Mitch Albom’s book is a gift to mankind.” -Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A wonderful book, a story of the heart told by a writer with soul.” -Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“An extraordinary contribution to the literature of death.” -Boston Globe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“One of those books that kind of sneaked up and grabbed people's hearts over time.” -Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“An elegantly simple story about a writer getting a second chance to discover life through the death of a friend.” -Tampa Tribune&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As sweet and nourishing as fresh summer corn . . . the book begs to be read aloud.” -USA Today&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sholem</member_name><member_id>445389</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242684534000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240181720000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesdays with Morrie</name><id>10220898</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241895600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/10220898/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/global_8295418.jpeg</photo_url></item>
