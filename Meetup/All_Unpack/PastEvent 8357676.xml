<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This month we are asking each attendee to bring one of their recent trades with them. Materials should include:&lt;br /&gt;How the particular asset was selected&lt;br /&gt;What criteria triggered the trade&lt;br /&gt;What trading strategy was used (make sure to include entry, exit, and protective measures)&lt;br /&gt;Final outcome of the trade (pro or con)&lt;br /&gt;Your own thoughts on what you could have done better, and what you think you learned from the trade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In lieu of a specific trade, if you would prefer to present some sort of material related to trading, please feel free to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hold an informal &amp;quot;Roound Table&amp;quot; discussion (or perhaps more aptly dissection) following each trade presentation. This will be in an effort to shed more light on the pros and cons from other perspective points of view and to answer any questions the others may have regarding strategies, etc.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and to the right (the Peace Dale Room). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! &lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221679298000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216298226000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charlestown IBD Forum</name><id>8357676</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218664800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/8357676/</event_url></item>
