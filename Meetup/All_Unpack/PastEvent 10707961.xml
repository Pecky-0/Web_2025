<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The July Green Drinks event (a monthly event providing free beer and social networking for political progressives) will be held at &lt;b&gt;Sebago Brewery&lt;/b&gt;'s production facility off Route 25 between Westbrook and Gorham, and the Bicycle Commuter Meet-Up is planning a group ride there and back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are providing two basic route options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/July14GreenDrinkRide" target="_blank"&gt;direct route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on mostly arterials is offered for those who want an aerobic workout and/or don't mind traffic and just want to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Meanwhile, those who prefer to relax and socialize instead of dealing with traffic can take the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/July14GreenDrinkRide" target="_blank"&gt;relaxed but longer route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; through a series of neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both routes will leave at &lt;b&gt;5:15 PM from Monument Square&lt;/b&gt;. We are unsure at this point if we will also be organizing group rides back to Portland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A copy of the map and the guidelines below will be given to all participants. &lt;b&gt;Copies of &lt;a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/" target="_blank"&gt;Bicycling Street Smarts&lt;/a&gt; will also be available!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring lights&lt;/b&gt;, as &lt;a href="http://www.sunrisesunset.com/" target="_blank"&gt;sunset is at 8:21 PM&lt;/a&gt; and you may not get home by then! &lt;b&gt;A helmet&lt;/b&gt; is also highly recommended. And of course, &lt;b&gt;drink responsibly&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;RIDE GUIDELINES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) BE SAFE AND LEGAL - Follow the rules of the road:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Ride on the right side of the road, inside a single lane (or shoulder if you prefer). &lt;br /&gt;* Stop for stop signs, functioning red lights, and pedestrians. &lt;br /&gt;* Use rightmost appropriate lane at multi-lane intersections. &lt;br /&gt;* Observe right of way rules. &lt;br /&gt;* Think for yourself, don't just follow the pack. Signal your stops and turns for the benefit of riders and motorists behind you. &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) BE COURTEOUS to other road users.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If safe passing by cars is possible, facilitate it by: &lt;br /&gt;- Yelling &amp;quot;car back&amp;quot; to the riders in front of you. &lt;br /&gt;- Riding single file (but always a safe distance from the edge). &lt;br /&gt;- Splitting into smaller groups at least a car's length apart, so an overtaking car can pass in stages. &lt;br /&gt;* Be friendly to everyone, even if they antagonize you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250121727000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245689412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>July Green Drinks Group Ride</name><id>10707961</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247605200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/10707961/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/7/3/global_4031747.jpeg</photo_url></item>
