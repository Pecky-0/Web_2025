&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Tortilla Flats on Hope st. over on the East Side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tortillaflatsri.com/"&gt;http://tortillaflatsri.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tortilla Flats is another East Side institution - Located in an old firehouse on the corner of Hope St. and Olney St. and caddy-corner to Hope High School, it's situated north of the Thayer St. shopping area and is somewhat its own neighborhood spot. Although the food has received mixed reviews by the standards of the very discerning and highly-evolved palettes of most PVD diners, people like it for the warm, casual and friendly atmosphere. Its basic Mexican food served best with their highly regarded Margaritas. Its been around forever and any time we talk about going to a Mexican place, Tortilla Flats always comes up as a place to go. Is it really possible that we haven't been here for over a year and a half!? So, if you haven't been in awhile, or you haven't been yet, let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Suzanne is hosting this one!
