It's based on the famous Newbery award winning book &amp;quot;Johnny Tremain&amp;quot; by Esther Forbes (first published in 1943). The tour will appeal to any middle-schooler who has recently read the book, as well as the older folks with them who might remember Johnny from their school days too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book (and tour) includes the story of the conflicts between the Sons of Liberty (hurray!) and the Loyalist Tories (boo!) in Boston in the era before the Revolutionary War.  It covers such historic events as the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's Ride and the Battle of Lexington and Concord.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnny finds himself in the right place at the right time to rub elbows with Paul Revere, Sam Adams, John Hancock and the great Dr. Joseph Warren.  The tour lasts 90 minutes and costs $10 (card-carrying &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot members&lt;/a&gt; pay $5, details on becoming a member are at our &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find your guides at the entrance to Copp's Hill Burying Ground, on Hull Street in the North End.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for folks wearing BBF badges, hats, bags, etc.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246810564000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241632897000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Johnny Tremain's Boston tour</name><id>10353076</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246474800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/10353076/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/global_8514023.jpeg</photo_url></item>
