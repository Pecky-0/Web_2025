It was another great meeting, this time focusing on several techniques from Robert Dilts? ?Strategies of Genius? series.  We played with the Disney and the Einstein strategies for creativity and innovation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For August: the theme is Metaphors, a central concept to NLP.  Metaphors are used as elaborate language patterns, as a lingua franca for understanding other?s perceptual maps in terms of our own, and as a powerful teaching tool.  Metaphors are also an exceptionally powerful vehicle for solving problems in creative ways.  In this month?s meetup, we?ll be exploring metaphorical problem solving.  We?ll focus primarily on visual metaphors, and we?ll learn (and practice) the technique of ?drawing solutions?.  I?ll provide the paper and markers; you provide the challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August?s NLP meetup does not depend on having attended any of the previous NLP meetups. It also does not presuppose that you know anything about NLP. Everyone is welcome, from beginners to experts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you. &lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;Andover-Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
