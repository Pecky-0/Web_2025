<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Members need not have any previous experience in Energy Healing.  You can join simply to LEARN all the latest modalities, if you so choose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We previously compared different energy healing modalities in regards to what frequency level healing currents are accessed and applied.  For example, chi is name of dimension 1 current, ki is name of dimension 2 current, rei is name of dimension 3 current, etc.  (Chinese modalities focus on balancing out the chi flows, ReiKi uses D2 &amp;amp; D3 current, etc.)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also discussed a modality which uses frequencies from the 12th dimension, and started using one of these techniques.  The 12th dimensional energy currents contain the original blueprint for perpetual health and wellness, with NO distortions.  Accessing and directing these currents progressively clears out all distortions at the lower levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to requests made by a few of our members, the June meeting will explore topics of Keylontic Science.  If you don't know what that is, bring up this definition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keylonticdictionary.org/Words/K/Keylonta.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to precede this string by &lt;a href="http://www" target="_blank"&gt;http://www...&lt;/a&gt;.  before attempting to bring up this web-page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a good idea to bring a personal recorder along, so you can later refer to powerful healing techniques which are usually given out at each meeting.  Please bring your own refreshments also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, we will discuss possible future topics, and agree on the topic for the following month's meeting, before we adjourn.  Feel free to e-mail me privately if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you soon!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aalia&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the lady with long black hair and a BIG smile (see photo here).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aalia Kusmis</member_name><member_id>7978464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269201554000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bio-Spiritual Healers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BioSpiritualWellness</urlname><id>1275951</id><group_lat>43.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>Bio-Spiritual Wellness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241309389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England Energy Healing Association June Meetup</name><id>10322418</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244329200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BioSpiritualWellness/events/10322418/</event_url></item>
