Answer:  One was the first to publish “Mary Had a Little Lamb” - and might (or might not) have written it.  She was also the real force behind the completion of the Bunker Hill Monument (Sarah Josepha Hale).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The history of Boston was reputed to begin with another (Ann Pollard).  Still another was known in her time as the “Queen of Boston” because she was born within 3 days of Queen Victoria, and she was just as popular in her own city, partly for introducing the idea of a Mother’s Day after the Civil War split the country (Julia Ward Howe).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another Victorian activist lent her name to women who kept their maiden names after marriage (Lucy Stone).  And that’s just the beginning – be sure to stop by to hear about these and another 24 (more or less) women whose contributions in fields such as medicine (e.g., Marie Zakrezewska and Susan Dimock), nutrition (Fannie Farmer), education (Elizabeth Cary Agassiz), literature (Esther Forbes), art (Isabella Stewart Gardner), women’s rights (Abigail Adams), and philanthropy (Mary Porter Hemenway) helped make Boston what it is today.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Great_Women_of_Boston" target="_blank"&gt;Great Women of Boston walking tour&lt;/a&gt; begins next to Boston's City Hall at the flag poles in Government Center. Tickets are $15 per person ($5 for &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot card holders&lt;/a&gt; -- see web site).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Guides will be outside near the flag poles.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246474735000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234537645000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Women of Boston</name><id>9735415</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238349600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/9735415/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/b/global_7293131.jpeg</photo_url></item>
