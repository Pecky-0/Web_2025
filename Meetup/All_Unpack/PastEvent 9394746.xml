We will have the honor of meeting Peggy Henderson who is a Blackfoot Indian shaman initiated in several shamanic traditions. She will lead us in a shamanic journey and share with us the shamanic view of dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting will be an introduction to the spiritual practice of dreaming. We will answer the questions: What are dreams? Why do we have them? What do they mean? How can they benefit us in our lives? How can we remember more of our dreams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in learning, guidance, and healing from your own dreams, this is the workshop is for you! We will cover the basics of dream technique and as well as do some dream sharing and interpretation. Come meet other dreamers. It helps to have a guide and fellow travelers with you when you take a journey into unfamiliar territory. Take the inner journey and find your way in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:00 - 5:00 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting fee:&lt;br /&gt;$20 in advance, payable online through Meetup (Amazon Payments)&lt;br /&gt;$25 at the door&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deerheart</member_name><member_id>7399016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240768147000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Dreamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonDreamers</urlname><id>1339734</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Dreamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230422878000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Power of Your Dreams</name><id>9394746</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234724400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonDreamers/events/9394746/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/f/global_6751295.jpeg</photo_url></item>
