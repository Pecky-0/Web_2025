In addition to methods to enhance and bring out the best results in your photography, be it portrait, or landscape. One person (maybe 2 if there's time) in attendance will have an opportunity for a free portrait in this session, so you might want to dress up for the possibility. &lt;u&gt;DO NOT wear anything green&lt;/u&gt;, and solid colors are preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be fun and hopefully knowledge based and entertaining meetup.  Hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments are served.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266624207000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265718021000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NO FEE!
