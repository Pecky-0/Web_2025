Sacrifice Rock on Old Sandwich Road is the Antiquarian Society's oldest and perhaps least known historic site.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Centuries before the arrival of English settlers to the area, this ancient landmark was an important stop for wayfarers. Travelers left small branches or stones atop the rock perhaps as a gesture of sacrifice, or to receive the blessing of safe passage -- the full meaning of the custom is shrouded by time. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Visit the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.plymouthantiquariansociety.org/historic.htm"&gt;Plymouth Antiquarian Society website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for more info about Sacrifice Rock and other historic Plymouth properties.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://wickedyankee.blogspot.com/2011/11/chamber-rock-bournedale-ma_22.html"&gt;The Wicked Yankee blog touched on Sacrifice Rock and another similar rock Chamber Rock in Bournedale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; It was also featured on "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w2Sw7tj938"&gt;Creepy Places in New England&lt;/a&gt;", featuring an attempted interview with the spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacrifice Rock is not on our actual hike but we will pass it on the way and may make a brief stop after the hike-- if there is any interest.  It is listed as being along Old Sandwich Road near Sacrifice Rock Road-- at 394 Old Sandwich Road.&lt;/p&gt;

Our hike will be about 2 hours. As you might expect, the Pine Hills are hilly!  Wear good shoes and bring water / snacks/ sun&amp;amp;bug stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast at 8:30 at Metro's Cafe on 3A in Plymouth. All are welcome to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
