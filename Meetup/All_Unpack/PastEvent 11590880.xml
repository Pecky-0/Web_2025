Due to some holiday parties, we'll have to wait until 8:30 to bowl, so let's meet at 7 for dinner in the restaurant area. I plan to arrive early (~6:30) to put our name on the bowling waitlist. It will help to have as many people as possible there early. If we order entrees in the restaurant, we'll get preference when a lane opens. For your information, shoe rental costs $4 and games are $5.50 each (so $15 total if we bowl two games). Open mic starts at 9 in the restaurant. Once we finish bowling, let's grab a drink and watch the talent -- musicians, comics, poets, you name it. If you're feeling bold, sign up starts at 7:30. I'm going to read a couple of poems. We can be our own cheering section!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick</member_name><member_id>8504559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260576584000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255119321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner, Bowling, and Open Mic Night at King's</name><id>11590880</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260403200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11590880/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/9/global_11130985.jpeg</photo_url></item>
