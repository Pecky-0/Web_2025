This, along with Harvard Medical School's Science in the News lecture series held in the Fall are the best technical lectures in the Boston area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Unlocking the mysteries of diabetes&amp;quot;, From the site:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/outreach/midsummer/schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin, which is critical for regulating the body's glucose levels. Destruction of beta cells causes type 1 diabetes, a lifelong autoimmune disease that begins in childhood. Beta cells may also be important in type 2 diabetes. Bridget Wagner will discuss these diseases, and scientific efforts to coax the body to replenish missing beta cells, and to protect the few that remain&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Lecturer: Bridget Wagner, Ph.D. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/science/programs/chemical-biology/bridget-wagner" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Bridget Wagner is a group leader in pancreatic biology and metabolic disease in the Chemical Biology Program at the Broad Institute. Her research focuses on identifying small molecules capable of increasing pancreatic beta-cell number and function, with the ultimate goal of treating type 1 diabetes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Beta-cell death, and the consequent deficiency in insulin secretion, is a key feature of type 1 diabetes. For decades, the standard of care for this disease has been insulin therapy by intramuscular injection. Current approaches to develop new treatments have prioritized islet transplantation and directed stem-cell differentiation, while many technological advances have focused on glucose detection and insulin delivery. While cell-based treatments show promise, a chemical intervention capable of restoring glycemic control in type 1 diabetes would have enormous impact clinically, by enabling an in vivo pancreatic effect while avoiding the need for immunosuppression. Bridget’s group is developing phenotypic-cell based assays to find compounds that increase human beta-cell proliferation, that can protect beta cells from the inflammatory processes of diabetes progression, or that can induce other cells in the pancreas to take over the role of beta cells by producing insulin themselves&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be waiting outside near the entrance where the stone &amp;quot;Broad Institute&amp;quot; sign is located starting at 5:40 pm. We can sit down as a group at 5:45 pm. Everyone and their brother walks in last minute, and by 5:55 pm, the place becomes a full house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can decide after if we want to go out to eat after, or just hang out in the lobby, where they have cheese plates and veggie trays, and chat with the lecturers. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Register for the event with the Broad Institute:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/outreach/midsummer/register.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Go to the Registration Page at &lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/registration/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt; and select the button marked &amp;quot;Attend&amp;quot; under the &amp;quot;Midsummer Nights' Science: July 7th, 2010&amp;quot; category. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* For some odd reason, they want you to specifically create a profile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Once you log on with your profile, you can select which event you want to go on, July 7th, July 21st, July 28th, or August 4th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* RSVP with Nerd Fun on the individual write up page, just so T.J. knows who to look for so he can wave members of the Nerd Herd into a group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schedule for Midsummer Nights' Science (On Wednesday Nights):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/outreach/midsummer/schedule.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* July 7th, 6-7pm: &lt;u&gt;Meet your microbes&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* July 21st, 6-7pm: &lt;u&gt;Unlocking the mysteries of diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* July 28th, 6-7pm: &lt;u&gt;The genetic roots of heart disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* August 4th, 6-7pm: &lt;u&gt;Keeping your brain plastic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Midsummer Nights' Science:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/outreach/midsummer/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Midsummer Nights' Science will recount the scientific transformation that began more than a century ago with the seminal studies by the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel -- the &amp;quot;father of genetics&amp;quot; -- who observed the ways in which physical traits were passed from one pea plant to another. In honor of the scientific field it helped to launch, the pea plant provides the inspiration for the seminar series, which takes its name from one of William Shakespeare's well-known plays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Midsummer Nights' Science at the Broad Institute will take place at our research building at 7 Cambridge Center, Cambridge MA, in Kendall Square. The series will run for four weeks on Wednesday evenings, July 7th, 21st, 28th, and August 4th, from 6 - 7 o'clock&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/outreach/midsummer/contact.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.broadinsti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard was founded in 2003 to bring the power of genomics to biomedicine. It pursues this mission by empowering creative scientists to construct new and robust tools for genomic medicine, to make them accessible to the global scientific community, and to apply them to the understanding and treatment of disease&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And what is the Broad Institute?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...
