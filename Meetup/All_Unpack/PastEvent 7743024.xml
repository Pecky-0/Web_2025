From that landing is a view of a mill, historic homes, and shade trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEET*: At the posted time, with 1/2 hour leeway for late-comers. You can meet us either at the pond itself, or else at the Sandwich coffee shop (I doubt that's its official name) at the end of Jarvis street. in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Take route 3S. From Boston it's about 1:15. Continue straight, over the bridge. Once over the bridge continue about 15 minutes roughly until you find signs for historic Sandwich/Mashpee. Take that exit. Off the ramp, take a left and drive into town. You'll pass the pond on your left. The coffee shop is on Jarvis Street, I believe the 2nd side street past the library on your right. The coffee shop is at the very end. All of this is easy to find once you approach the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: &lt;br /&gt;RSVPs: It's best to let us know you are coming so we can look for you or alert you to any changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO BRING WHICH ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN: &lt;br /&gt;Mosquito repellant, Paper towels, Sweater, water, food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*LAX: We meet at the time above. You have 30 minutes additional slack, after which we may leave to the painting site without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald &lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627 &lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216667238000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208263605000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PLEIN AIR OUTING: Sandwich Center</name><id>7743024</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216494000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/7743024/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/c/global_1743932.jpeg</photo_url></item>
