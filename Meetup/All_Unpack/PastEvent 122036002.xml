&lt;p&gt;...we're getting together to share some food, some drink, some fun, and watch the original theatrical release of "Return of the Jedi" on glorious widescreen TV to celebrate 30 years since the Star Wars saga was brought to a close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shall be pot luck. Bring something to share! After the movie, we can play some games (or during the movie in a different room for those that want to)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressing up like Jabba the Hutt is optional; dressing up as Princess Leia in gold metal bikini is very, very, very optional. Eating like Jabba the Hutt is encouraged. And don't forget the Ewoks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marion buteau</member_name><member_id>12445225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1370053118000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1369935567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>30th Anniversary Return of the Jedi Showing and games</name><id>122036002</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1370041200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/122036002/</event_url></item>
