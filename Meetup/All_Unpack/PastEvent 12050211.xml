So lets try it out! The last two foodie events have been a blast... lots of very very interesting people in the group. Hope to see more this thursday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This place is right on Davis Square T station. You can get there by Red Line. And if I am not wrong, there is a nice little public parking area on Day St for those who plan to come by car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, its cold out there, but what better way to fight the cold than eat indian food? ;)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Archana</member_name><member_id>10242139</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260664524000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260337306000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indian food - Namaskar</name><id>12050211</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260491400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/12050211/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
