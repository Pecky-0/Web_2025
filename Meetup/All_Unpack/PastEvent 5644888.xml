The tour opens on April 10, 2007, when Michael Berger presents his film at the University of Hartford, with Q &amp;amp; A following. The 69-minute film documentary examines the startling events of September 11, 2001 from a scientific perspective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film closely examines one of the worlds worst catastrophes from a civil engineering perspective.  Using photo and video footage, as well as expert scientific testimony, the film thoroughly analyzes the official reports, offering varied criticisms of the official findings, while presenting a more plausible hypothesis.  Both government investigations and the mainstream media have quietly ignored the findings from scientific experts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dramatic collapse of World Trade Center 7 is something everyone ought to see&lt;br /&gt;It really does have the characteristics of an explosive demolition.&lt;br /&gt;-- Dr. Steven Jones, physicist, author of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles/Why%20Indeed%20Did%20the%20WTC%20Buildings%20Completely%20Collapse%20Jones%20Thermite%20World%20Trade%20Center%20J24.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Completely Collapse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The World Trade Center Twin Towers on September 11, 2001 disintegrated in a manner that some scientists say resembled deliberately calculated demolitions.  The facts open for discussion include: at 5:20 p.m. that same day another building, the 47-story WTC 7, completely collapsed within 70 feet of its footprint in 6.6 seconds.  These three buildings became the first such structures to ever suffer complete collapse due to fire and structural damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Berger and Connect the Dots produced ?Improbable Collapse: The Demolition of our Republic.? Berger is also the media coordinator for 911truth.org. He has appeared on ABC World News Tonight, CNN Showbiz Tonight, and Scarborough Country as well as dozens of radio appearances including a recent debate with Matthew Rothschild, editor of The Progressive Magazine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 April to 23 April, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10 - &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=224" target="_blank"&gt;University of Hartford&lt;/a&gt;, CT; 4/11 - &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=209" target="_blank"&gt;First Churches, Northampton&lt;/a&gt;, MA; &lt;br /&gt;4/11 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=210" target="_blank"&gt;Holyoke Community College&lt;/a&gt;; 4/12 - &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=217" target="_blank"&gt;Keene State College&lt;/a&gt;, Putnam Theater, NH; &lt;br /&gt;4/13 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=246" target="_blank"&gt;Greenfield Community TV&lt;/a&gt;, MA; 4/14 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=218" target="_blank"&gt;Hooker-Dunham Theater, Brattleboro&lt;/a&gt;, VT; &lt;br /&gt;4/15 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=220" target="_blank"&gt;Berkshire Community College&lt;/a&gt;, MA; 4/15 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=219" target="_blank"&gt;Unitarian Universalists, Springfield&lt;/a&gt;, MA; &lt;br /&gt;4/16 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=225" target="_blank"&gt;University At Albany&lt;/a&gt;, New York; 4/17 Bennington Free Library, Bennington VT; &lt;br /&gt;4/18 Best Western.., Concord, NH; 4/19 Dover Friends Meeting House, Dover, NH; &lt;br /&gt;4/20 UMASS Edu.., New Bedford, MA; 4/21 Democracy Center, Cambridge, MA; &lt;br /&gt;4/22 Wilton Town Hall Theater, NH; April 23 &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/calendar_event.php?eid=241" target="_blank"&gt;Hampshire College, Amherst&lt;/a&gt;, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find links to all venues with PDF links to download posters at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flybynews.com/" target="_blank"&gt;FlybyNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176505696000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>valley911truth</urlname><id>300645</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Valley 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175889473000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>IMPROBABLE COLLAPSE NorthEast Tour w/Mike Berger</name><id>5644888</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176332400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/valley911truth/events/5644888/</event_url></item>
