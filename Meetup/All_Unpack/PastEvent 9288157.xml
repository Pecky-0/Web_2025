<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I've been wanting to see this movie for months! &lt;br /&gt;It's playing at the IMAX! This should be awesome. If you've never been to the IMAX you're missing out. HUGE Screen and incredible sound system. &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the front entrance at 4:45 and head over to the theater just before 5. The movie starts at 5:15 and runs for just under 2 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Revised! After the movie I have a reservation at The British Beer Company for 7:30. Check out their menu by downloading their menu here: &lt;a href="http://britishbeer.com/BBC_Web_Menu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://britishbeer.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're located at :&lt;br /&gt;120 Worcester Rd.&lt;br /&gt;Framingham, MA 01702&lt;br /&gt;Phone number (508)879-1776&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This place is ALWAYS packed! I thought it'd be better to go to a place that took reservations than wait for a table for an hour or more at The Cheesecake Factory. &lt;br /&gt;The Cheesecake factory does reservations during the week so keep your eye on the calendar for a weeknight DINNER NIGHT coming soon. &lt;br /&gt;Please Please Please! Buy your tickets in advance on-line at &lt;a href="http://www.jordansimaxtheatre.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jordansima...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Select the Natick Theater and make sure you select December 20th at 5:15pm. &lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't bought your tickets yet DON'T RSVP! &lt;br /&gt;I've set an rsvp limit of 8 people for each group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions call me (508) 212-4111&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the front entrance just inside the revolving door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>3673693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233147747000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228513638000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MOVIE NIGHT!
