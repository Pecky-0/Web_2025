We&amp;#146;ll be back next on January 29th and then on February 12th for our special Valentine&amp;#146;s Day brunch party. The $3 mimosas and screwdrivers quickly turned to shots which quickly turned to dancing. And the networking was in full swing as a few people got new job leads. Guests will be enticed by a delicious brunch menu as DJ Chris Roxx spins an infectious playlist. The lights will be dimmed, the shades will be closed, corks will be popping and we&amp;#146;ll be featuring $3 screwdrivers as well as a fresh brunch food menu. Tired of the same old, same old brunch scene in Boston? We&amp;#146;re flipping the switch and keeping the weekend going on Sunday. This brunch is not for the conservative or the weary. No kids, no chores, no errands, no laundry&amp;#133;come ready to party, forget about real life for the afternoon. Grab your friends and check out Boston&amp;#146;s new hot scene as the weather gets cold. This is a truly unique experience where dancing on tables is encouraged. Come on down and see us. As seen in Stuff Magazine, Yelp, livetoeatfood and Urban Daddy. Reservations not required but encouraged.
