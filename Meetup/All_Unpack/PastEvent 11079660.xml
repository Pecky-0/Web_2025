You bring yourselves and some interesting conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will ask each person to contibute $10 to help defray the cost of our purchases.  &lt;br /&gt;We can comfortably accomodate about 20 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time:  6:30 pm - 9 pm    Even if you can just come for a short time, still come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place:  Our home in West Roxbury (bordering Brookline and Jamaica Plain).  &lt;br /&gt;***Note:  I will provide the exact address and my phone number to those who RSVP.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's easy to get here from all over Boston - we're inside the 128 corridor.  Also great for those in Boston not wanting to drive - we're just 1 block from the Commuter Rail Bellevue Station (13 minutes from Back Bay, 17 minutes from South Station)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to take the Commuter Rail?  Take the Needham Line to Bellevue Station.  A train arrives here at 6:21pm which will get you here just in time.  There are trains back to the city at 7:43 and 9:20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stacy and Ingo&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacy Goodman</member_name><member_id>3216337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255715704000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249936300000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>*New Date* Wine and Cheese Tasting - early evening social</name><id>11079660</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254781800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/11079660/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
