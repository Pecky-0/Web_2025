<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a true, spontaneous Impromptu Philosophizer for a meeting three days hence!  We'll meet at John Harvard's Brew House in Harvard Square to mix, mingle and talk philosophically from the ridiculous to the sublime.  If I get a clear commitment for 20 people I will reserve table space.  It's Harvard Square, so a change of venue can always be organized easily if seating is a problem.  The group may or may not be split up but, regardless, we will try to make it possible for folks to move around and mingle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Impromptu Philosophizer introduction follows&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Impromptu Philosophizer is a casual meeting at a cafe or pub that may or may not have a specific topic, and may even be scheduled “on the spur of the moment!" It's great to know that there is now a way for philosophically minded people to meet but with no particular agenda other than that of satisfying the need to talk about what's on your mind. Whether the interest or concern involves current events or politics, cultural or intellectual issues, personal stuff, pure philosophy or whatever else is on your mind we can all benefit from sharing philosophical persp-inectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therapy for the sane," a term used by Gerd Achenbach (founder of the modern &lt;a href="http://www.integralhypnosis.com/philosophical_counseling.htm" target="_blank"&gt;philosophical counseling&lt;/a&gt; movement), may partially suggest the Impromptu Philosophizer concept but it is more multifaceted than, say, an occasional "therapy" session after a trying day. IPs are designed to be fun, engaging and unique opportunities for creating a near spontaneous venue to meet other group members for the purpose of sharing thoughts, ideas and concerns from a philosophical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impromptu Philosophizers are spontaneous, existentially driven meetings and discussions. Of course, continue to check back often for the scheduling of the somewhat more structured, topical meetings that are regularly scheduled by Boston Area Philosophy Discussions!&lt;/p&gt;
