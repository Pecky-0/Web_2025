Hear about the care and history of their female barred owl, as well as the behavior of these magnificent creatures in the wild.  &lt;u&gt;The audubon society will charge $3 for members and $5 for nonmembers for the owl presentation&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be wearing a pink top and will greet you at  the entrance to the center starting at 1:45. &lt;br /&gt;The presentation will run from 2:00 until 2:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're only interested in the hike, we will be starting at 2:40. I'll be charging $1 for the hike to cover meetup expenses.   I'll be guiding the group on a 1.5 mile gentle hike through the woods to the osprey blind ending in a hay field where I'd love to do some bird watching with anyone who is interested.  (I've spotted blue birds, phoebes, goldfinches, and black-capped chickadees to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273354976000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272565696000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live Owl Presentation followed by hike</name><id>13331729</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273341600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/13331729/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/9/global_14709609.jpeg</photo_url></item>
