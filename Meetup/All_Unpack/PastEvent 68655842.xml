 Weâ€™ll walk around downtown Beverly and meet the local plants that offer a wealth of food, medicine, and other uses, some free for the picking. &lt;br /&gt;

 You will also learn about plant identification, safety, and use and preparation. A set of handouts is included as part of the walk. &lt;br /&gt;

 There is a $15.00 fee for the class, payable when you arrive.
