Spero che avete l'opportunita di essere fuori di casa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a beautiful day it is today! I hope you have the opportunity to be outside today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last six months a couple of members have suggested this wonderful vineyard in Wallingford, CT called Gouveia Vineyards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd27/lorenzo66_photos/fallpict1.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At our last meetup, Frank Capone decide to look into this. Well here's what Frank uncovered in his own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&amp;quot;We should arrive by 4:00 to get good seating.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone brings something good to eat ( a little extra)  and&lt;br /&gt;it's best if we do &amp;quot;pot luck&amp;quot; type thing. Someone, I could&lt;br /&gt;volunteer , to organize a food list, so we don't end up with 12&lt;br /&gt;portions of bruschetta. Participants must buy the wine from the vineyard (est. $20 a&lt;br /&gt;bottle). So if each couple or every 2 people split a bottle,&lt;br /&gt;the night is affordable.  If it rains, there is indoor seating.&lt;br /&gt;We could arrange for a handful of us to get there earlier if&lt;br /&gt;that's a concern.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another idea is we'll all chip in $5, and get pizzas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think it over. If you are interested and free on Saturday June 26th, RSVP YES and more details about that day will be forthcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to check out there website click on the link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gouveiavineyards.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gouveiavin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorenzo</member_name><member_id>4408109</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277586809000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Amici Italiani</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-452</urlname><id>535327</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274023513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Afternoon Delight at  Gouveia Vineyards - Walingford, CT</name><id>13498388</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277582400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-452/events/13498388/</event_url></item>
