If you are concerned about cats, farm animals, local animal issues, or just generally creating a more compassionate Maine, you should attend this informative and motivational meeting to learn how you can take action for animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you have attended one of our grassroots meetings in the past, join us again to refresh your skills and meet other local animal advocates. Remember to bring your ideas, concerns and questions, and donâ€™t forget to invite your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP today to lend your voice for animals and make a difference in Maine. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279149788000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276615783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Animal Welfare Meet-Up</name><id>13807494</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279145700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/13807494/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/b/global_9047547.jpeg</photo_url></item>
