This baseball field/diamond is across the street from the Federal Archives building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will walk unless its heavy rain.  Call me on my cell is you are unsure 508-472-7900.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A walk through a 240 acre parcel of land that will become an  MDC reservation and be aprt of the Western Greenway. Several miles of old carriage roads loop through a variety of habitats: cattail marshes, red maple swamps, mature oak-hickory forests, vernal pools, new forests, and open meadows. Because of the diverse ecosystems, this area is a good place to observe a variety of wildlife, including species of special concern: wood frogs and painted turtles. On the west side of the hospital at the end of Marguerite Avenue is West Meadow, a large &amp;quot;quaking&amp;quot; bog, which is criss-crossed with paths, enabling hikers to walk across what would otherwise be a dangerous trek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Western Greenway is a swath of green space that stretches for six miles beginning in Belmont and Lexington, and looping through Waltham as far south as Beaver Street.
