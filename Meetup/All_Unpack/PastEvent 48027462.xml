Beautiful voices, harmonies, melodies, a lot of energy. Should be fun! Check out their new album Paradise. Opener is Air Waves, don't know who they are! Oh and only $9! TT The Bears website says they go on at 11:30 but it's a Friday so come on down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could meet at TT The Bears at 10 (by the bar?), but if someone has a better a place, please suggest it. I'm not too familiar with what's around that area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jae</member_name><member_id>25171402</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329539499000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326506111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Slow Club, 2/17/12 TT The Bears Cambridge</name><id>48027462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329534000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/48027462/</event_url></item>
