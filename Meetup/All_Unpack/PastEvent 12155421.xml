I tested this place for you tonight (sheesh, the things I do for you guys) It was great! Good atmosphere, good food, good music and the prices are very reasonable. Most entrees are priced between 15 - 18 dollars. Though less will get you very ample appetizer plates. There is a pay parking lot directly next door. I have reserved 16 spots all together and four of them are in a cozy little veiled cushioned seating area for the younger members of our group. If you like to be adventurous without getting too exotic, I think you will enjoy this. Here is a link :&lt;a href="http://www.istanbulcafect.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.istanbulca...&lt;/a&gt; . As usual, call me if there are questions, complaints (nah not really) or you need directions. This is a fairly small place and I must let them know a final headcount 48 hours in advance, so if you say you are coming - please come. See you guys there.
