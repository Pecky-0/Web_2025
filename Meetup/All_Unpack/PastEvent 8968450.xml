This will be a potluck dinner so plan to bring some munchies!  A casserole, dessert, finger food or your specialty dish is appreciated.  We will have a signup at November's meeting so get those culinary craniums cranking...  We usually start eating around 6:30.

We will also be having a yankee swap.  Each person that wishes to participate in the swap should bring a small (if possible, [u]humanism[/u]) related gift (suggested target price range of about $10).  Last year's event was a fun time, with good food and good company, not to mention some pretty interesting and humorous gifts.

&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HumanLight"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HumanLight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 (sometimes Humanlight) is the Humanist counterpart to Christmas and other winter holidays. It is celebrated on December 23. Like Kwanzaa, HumanLight is a modern invention, created to provide a specifically Humanist counterpart to popular seasonal celebrations. It was established by the New Jersey Humanist Network in 2001.

Humanists have cast HumanLight as a celebration of "a Humanist's vision of a good future." They celebrate a positive approach to the coming new year, generally through the lens of Humanist (and particularly secular humanist) philosophy--secular as opposed to religious, and with an emphasis on reason and rationality. The December 23 date allows HumanLight to connect itself to the December holiday season without imposing itself over them, since many Humanists also celebrate other winter holidays.

HumanLight began with a single event in Verona, New Jersey, 2001. Since then, HumanLight has experienced much growth; in 2004, there were two dozen American events listed on the holiday's homepage, mostly on the East Coast and in the Midwest.

Organized HumanLight celebrations since its founding in 2001 have included guest speakers, candle-lighting ceremonies, musical and dramatic performances, dinners, dancing, and video presentations. As Humanists value creativity and an open mind, celebrations can vary from event to event or year to year.

&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Day"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Rights Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is celebrated annually across the world on 10 December. It is endorsed by the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) as an official day of Humanist celebration.
