&lt;p&gt;The Rincon Limeno Restaurant is located in East Boston, Massachusetts. The quality of their service is only surpassed by the quality of their food. They've been serving the most exquisite Peruvian cuisine and we think it's time that you experience it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you enter let yourself be whisked away by sights, sounds, and aromas&amp;hellip; but that is just the beginning. They guarantee one visit will keep you coming again and again. You'll be drawn in by the authentic Peruvian decor as you venture on a gastronomic adventure into the traditional flavors of Peru. The aromas of their delicious dishes will keep you on the edge of your seat and when your food arrives we guarantee every bite will blow you away!&lt;/p&gt;
Peruvian cuisine, in addition to its Inca origins, combines Spanish, Asian, and African influences to make an eclectic fusion of indigenous crops, spices, meats and seafood. Fresh ingredients and imaginative sauces are a hallmark of Peruvian cuisine, as is the popular Aji Amarillo pepper. This fruity flavored and aromatic pepper is incorporated into many dishes, adding mild spice and a pleasant yellow color. This pepper can be mixed with oil and used as a flavorful condiment or dipping sauce as well.
