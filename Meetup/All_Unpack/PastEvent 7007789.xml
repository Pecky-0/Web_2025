No one else going to Barnes and Noble&lt;br /&gt;Has to change their RSVP to Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Wait for us out side of the Movie Room Doors of National Treasure: Book of Secrets for the 1:30 Screening.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199817215000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Those who enjoy Action Films.
