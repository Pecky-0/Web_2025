This is an out-and-back trip, should take about an hour and a half, maybe a little more. This walk is on flat, mostly paved roads the whole way.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be parked in the lot across from the Farren Care Center on Montague City Road, Turners</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michelle </member_name><member_id>34071322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367754024000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365948068000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canalside Rail Trail: Over the River to see the Trains</name><id>114269452</id><headcount>6</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367677800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/114269452/</event_url></item>
