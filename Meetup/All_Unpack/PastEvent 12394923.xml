This is the introduction workshop from her series “Relating Consciously and Compassionately to Ourselves, Others, and the Planet” which offers concepts, techniques, and practices based on Marshall Rosenberg’s book, &lt;a href="http://&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892005034?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=greatworcehum-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1892005034&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=greatworcehum-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1892005034&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 0px !important&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/img&amp;gt;" target="_blank"&gt;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life&lt;/a&gt;, and his work as founder of the &lt;a href="http://cnvc.org" target="_blank"&gt;International Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC.org)&lt;/a&gt;.  This topic is so critically important these days, when both non-violence and effective communication seem to be in such short supply.  Feedback from those who have already seen this workshop suggests it is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to show up at the church around 6:00pm if you would like to socialize. The formal meeting will start at 6:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting is free and open to the public, but we always welcome donations at the door. If you are not already a paying member of GWH, we encourage you to become one.  It's only $30 for a one-year membership.  Dues help to pay the cost of speakers and other programming, and they allow us to do outreach and other activities.  Please show your support for Humanism and GWH.  You can pay dues at the GWH web site: www.worcesterhumanists.org or you can see our treasurer, Don Guyton, at the next meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265931194000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264192973000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>GWH Meeting - February 2010 - Intro workshop on non-violent communication</name><id>12394923</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265758200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/12394923/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/2/global_7423922.jpeg</photo_url></item>
