The doors will open at 6:30 so, please come early to connect and socialize before the film begins. &lt;strong&gt;About the film&lt;/strong&gt;: Against the backdrop of an exotic land, a lone filmmaker is granted one hour to ask ten questions of the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. Containing rare historical footage as well as footage taken inside Tibet, a story is woven between a journeyman's personal observations, the troubled history of a government-in-exile, and the life and wisdom of one of the premiere spiritual leaders of our time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330463605000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329322876000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night - 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama</name><id>52446452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330214400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/52446452/</event_url></item>
