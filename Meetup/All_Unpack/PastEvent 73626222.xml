&lt;p&gt;There were some posted questions about attending if RSVP's are full, especially people who are already members.  If you don't RSVP in time to be one of the 20 attendees, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; this is a public event that you or anyone can attend and&lt;em&gt; general rules of friendly etiquette apply! &lt;/em&gt; It is just that the place will be a zoo and it will be hard to keep in contact while socializing even with 20.  As to the other question about guests, - so that the max number of CV members can attend, guests are not counted in the 20, - you can bring guests, they just won't be "officially" in the "meetup". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will email my phone # before the event to attendees so if you miss us in the foyer you can call when/if you get in.  If you get lost or have free time in the courtyard, we will try to commandeer a table or two and/or the stone seats in the corner to the left of the band to congregate.  Look at everyones pictures so we know who is going.  I will try to bring a copy of the pictures and will keep an eye out to say hi &amp;amp; introduce people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member said that the MFA will be free on Friday Aug 3 courtesy of Highlandstreet.org Free Summer Fridays program - thanks. We will verify that in the meantime - if anyone knows for certain post the info please. &lt;/p&gt;
