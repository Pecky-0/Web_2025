Arriving at the jail entirely alone, he appears younger and more fragile than the other convicts. Cornered by the leader of the Corsican gang who rules the prison, he is given a number of &amp;quot;missions&amp;quot; to carry out, toughening him up and gaining the gang leader's confidence in the process. But Malik is brave and a fast learner, daring to secretly develop his own plans. Directed and co-written by Jacques Audiard (The Beat That My Heart Skipped, Read My Lips). Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;I'm changing this meetup to Sunday afternoon in the hopes that members who asked for meetups 'in the burbs' might be able to attend.&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/aprophet/" target="_blank"&gt;A Prophet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/letters/aprophet.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Director/Co-writer Jacques Audiard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      15 Members like this &lt;br /&gt;      Venues West of Boston&lt;br /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      I'd like to suggest not-infrequent meetups at premium/arthouse theatres such as the Embassy in Waltham, the West Newton Cinema, and others. For those of us west of Boston, be that Newton or MetroWest, in-town attendance is often expensive, traffic-laden, and parking-poor. Frequent service via the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; or commuter rail doesn't exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      A regular break out in the 'burbs won't hurt anyone and will help more than a couple of members! Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the movies, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268569819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Prophet Metrowest</name><id>12871953</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269217800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12871953/</event_url></item>
