Assisting Cheri in this workshop is a special friend, Leslie Fiore (E-RYT 500) she is the founder of Port Yoga (www.portyoga.com). She has studied yoga for over 10 years and taught for over 7 years. Join us and learn how to lengthen your spine, strengthen your core, stretch out your hamstrings, get better balance, find additional rotation, and more. All poses will be accompanied by a discussion about how these will benefit your paddling and rolling skills. There will be a additional focus on kayak rolling, and specific land drills to help you improve your roll! This session is open to folks new to yoga as well as experienced yogi's and yoginis!&lt;/p&gt;
