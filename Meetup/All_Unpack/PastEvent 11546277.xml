Join us as we take in the latest movie showing at the new Showcase Cinema de Lux at Legacy Place in Dedham.  The third Sunday of the month we will meet for brunch or dinner and take in a great movie.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Meetup is scheduled for Sunday, October 18th to watch a comedy, The Informant staring Matt Damon.  We will meet in the lobby and head into the movie as a group.  Price of the tickets are $10.75 for adults and $8.00 for seniors.  Although The Informant is the selected movie, this is a 15 movie theatre with 14 other movies for you to choose from if you prefer.   We can meet up after the movies and compare reviews! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the movie:  Mark Whitacre has worked for lysine developing company ADM for many years and has even found his way into upper management. But nothing has prepared him for the job he is about to undertake - being a spy for the FBI. Unwillingly pressured into working as an informant against the illegal price-fixing activities of his company, Whitacre gradually adopts the idea that he's a true secret agent. But as his incessant lies keep piling up, his world begins crashing down around him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we will head over to the new P.F. Chang's for some yummy appetizers or early dinner...your choice.  This contemporary, bistro-style restaurant offers a unique blend of high quality, authentic Chinese cuisine.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for the first Sunday Afternoon at the Movies!&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the lobby of the theatre.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mindy</member_name><member_id>8014085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256249364000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254696357000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Afternoon at the Movies</name><id>11546277</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255886100000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/11546277/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/9/global_11148425.jpeg</photo_url></item>
