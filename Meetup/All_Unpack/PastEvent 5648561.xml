AnnMarie is a great person and a bike ride is another good event to meet people from  groups also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is a cut and paste from her posting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for approx. a 10 mile ride along the Cheshire bike path in Hamden! A very flat, easy ride that all can enjoy! &lt;br /&gt;Please meet up at 10:45 for a 11:00 start. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;directions: From rt.10 south proceed into Cheshire about 5 miles. Proceed a short distance to Cornwall street. Turn right onto Cornwall. The trail parking lot is at the intersection of Willow and Cornwall streets.A parking area is on both sides of the road. &lt;br /&gt;Look for a white Tracker with kayak racks!! &lt;br /&gt;My cell #860-309-3933 if any troubles! Rain/snow cancels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al's comment: 10 miles might sound like a lot, it isnt in reality...most people pedal at 6-12 miles per hour..6 being pretty slow..12 moving along calmly..15-18+..na not here unless its down hill......so even if you think you are out of shape....dont even think it..we will watie for you. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177425989000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Connecticut Arts - Theatre Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Theatre-Group</urlname><id>326612</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>Connecticut Theatre Group Arts-Theater Events Group Discount</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175994296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cheshire Bike Path ride With AnnMarie</name><id>5648561</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177253100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CT-Theatre-Group/events/5648561/</event_url></item>
