Hopefully some people want to join me.  The cost is $12.00 per lesson/Six lessons for $68.00.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Coast Swing is a contemporary form of swing dance with its roots dating back to the 1930s. West Coast Swing combines swing dancing with R&amp;amp;B, funk, pop, jazz and blues. It is a casual, &amp;quot; street dance&amp;quot; with a broad appeal across all age groups. It is an extremely versatile dance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Queen City is located above the Sanel Auto Parts Company @ 21 Dow Street. The building is on the same side of the street and next to Golds Gym. Look for glass doors on the side opposite Golds Gym, very near the road and then go up the stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Queen City Ballroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are preparing for a special event such as a wedding or a cruise, or just hoping to gain some confidence on the dance floor, the Queen City Ballroom can help you achieve your dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located in the north section of Manchester, NH, our studio is bright and airy with a great view of the city and features two nicely finished hardwood dance floors totaling more than 1,700 square feet of dance space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try us and see what a positive change dancing can make in your life! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.queencityballroomnh.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.queencityb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert</member_name><member_id>4121028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284410194000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281068780000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dance Lessons: Beginner West Coast Swing</name><id>14337007</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283900400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/14337007/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/c/3/global_12113315.jpeg</photo_url></item>
