A few people showed up anyway, which was great because the power was back on and we were able to hang out and chat. But we didn't do the milling demo and didn't build anything. And there was no pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 28th we'll hang out and eat pizza and I'll show you both 2.5 axis milling for rough milling, and 3-axis milling surface milling on the Tormach. I'll also show you how you can create your toolpaths using tools you can download for free from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your projects and/or your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a Novint Falcon haptic controller in the shop now, so if you are interested in haptic feedback devices, feel free to give it a shot. The controller allows you to feel objects, surface textures and the weight of objects on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The farmstand at the top of the hill. Yep.
