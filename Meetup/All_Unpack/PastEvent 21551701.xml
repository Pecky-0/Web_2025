for the Cambridge Book Club. Many thanks to Lisa for her great work
organizing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue with our pattern of alternating fiction with
non-fiction reads. Since May's read was fiction, June's will be
nonfiction, for which I've chosen 
&lt;em&gt;Girl, Interrupted&lt;/em&gt; by Susanna Kaysen. The book is rather
breezy at 168 pages, takes place in nearby Belmont, and is written
by a Cambridge author. The Minuteman library system has multiple
copies of the book. And it was made into a movie starring Winona
Ryder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirkus review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Kaysen was 18, in 1967, she was admitted to McLean
Psychiatric Hospital outside Boston, where she would spend the next
18 months. Now, 25 years and two novels (Far Afield, 1990; Asa, As
I Knew Him, 1987) later, she has come to terms with the experience-
-as detailed in this searing account. First there was the suicide
attempt, a halfhearted one because Kaysen made a phone call before
popping the 50 aspirin, leaving enough time to pump out her
stomach. The next year it was McLean, which she entered after one
session with a bullying doctor, a total stranger. Still, she signed
herself in: ``Reality was getting too dense...all my integrity
seemed to lie in saying No.'' In the series of snapshots that
follows, Kaysen writes as lucidly about the dark jumble inside her
head as she does about the hospital routines, the staff, the
patients. Her stay didn't coincide with those of various
celebrities (Ray Charles, Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell), but we are
not likely to forget Susan, ``thin and yellow,'' who wrapped
everything in sight in toilet paper, or Daisy, whose passions were
laxatives and chicken. The staff is equally memorable: ``Our
keepers. As for finders--well, we had to be our own finders.''
There was no way the therapists--those dispensers of dope
(Thorazine, Stelazine, Mellaril, Librium, Valium)--might improve
the patients' conditions: Recovery was in the lap of the gods (``I
got better and Daisy didn't and I can't explain why''). When, all
these years later, Kaysen reads her diagnosis (``Borderline
Personality''), it means nothing when set alongside her
descriptions of the ``parallel universe'' of the insane. It's an
easy universe to enter, she assures us. We believe her. Every word
counts in this brave, funny, moving reconstruction. For Kaysen,
writing well has been the best revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all in a few weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
