Many of us have done this in past years and it's lots of fun. Your $20 fee (you pay when you get there) will include your tube &amp;amp; life jacket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;I will email my cell a few days before the event to all Yes RSVPs. However, once on the river, I will not have a phone on me.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions are posted on their site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;There is no direct route, plan on a 1 hour drive. I suggest carpooling since it's a long drive. Please be on time as too not hold up those of us who want to get on the river. If you are attending late, feel free to meet us in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details see below as well as their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic info:&lt;br /&gt;Tubing is for swimmers only. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear a bathing suit and shorts, a long sleeved light T-shirt, or socks with the ends cut off to slip over your arms (this prevents chafing on your arms from rubbing on the tube), and something to protect your feet (old sneakers, Tevas, water shoes, or wet suit boots work great. Don't wear heavy boots or sandals that may slip off.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave all unnecessary items that you don't want to lose, at home. (eyeglasses, watches, rings, favorite hats, and jewelry are commonly lost during tubing.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fee includes:Rental of a specially designed river tube, a personal flotation device (life jacket), a shuttle bus ride from the take-out point to the starting point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218740465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217294850000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tubing on the Farmington River - Satan's Kingdom</name><id>8431285</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218382200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8431285/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
