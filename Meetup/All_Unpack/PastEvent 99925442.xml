Learn about the history of maple sugaring, tree identification, modern tapping and sap collecting technology, and the effect of climate change on maple trees. You'll also taste-test syrup and participate in a hands-on demo of sugaring techniques by tapping local trees, as part of the 10th annual Somerville Maple Syrup Project! Make sure to wear warm clothes and boots, since we'll be outside for part of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; $25 for members, $30 for non-members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Facilitator:&lt;/strong&gt; Lee Dwyer, the Gardens Coordinator for Groundwork Somerville, runs after-school gardening and nature clubs, urban agriculture workshops, and the Somerville Maple Syrup Project.
