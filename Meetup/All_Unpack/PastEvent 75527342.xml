Bring a headlamp or flashlight since we might be out past sunset.  We will only use our lights as needed and will not be paddling with them on. This is not a trip for beginners who have no experience paddling and staying with a group.  Moon rise is at 6:51 PM, 98% illuminated, so we should have a nice moon, once it climbs above the trees.  Expect partly cloudy skies and temps in the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parking and launch is on Route 135 between Hopkinton and Westborough centers, approx 42.24166 North and -71.57316 West.  Do not program "Whitehall State Park" into your GPS. That will not take you to the launch site.  The nearest side road is Dale Road in Hopkinton, just west of the parking lot entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to your headlamp or flashlight you should have a whistle and wear a properly fastened PFD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PLEASE NOTE - The organizers in this group are NOT trained leaders or instructors.  The organizers only set the time and place, each person participating in any group trip is responsible for their own safety.  Each participant is responsible for evaluating all relevant conditions for the trip and determining if their skills and equipment are appropriate for those conditions.)&lt;/p&gt;
