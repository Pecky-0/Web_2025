Hard to believe these gentlemen have real jobs, did you know one of them is actually a dentist by day?? True! And all nice folks.&lt;br /&gt;So...please watch for a new date, just waiting to hear back from the hall manager. This is as tricky as planning a wedding. But, when it happens it should be alot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime...we are meeting at Backstage Grille in Tewksbury. The management there was very accomodating last time and even reserved a special area just for us. Jill and Karen are planning the event and we all hope you can join us. A new band called &amp;quot;Scortch&amp;quot; will be providing the dance music and their play list sounds great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let us know in your response if you would like to meet earlier at 8 for dinner. They claim to have great sirloin tips! Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We have the "bullpen" reserved for our group...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232066572000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
