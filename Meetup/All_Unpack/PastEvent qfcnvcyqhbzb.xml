The trails are wide and well maintained. There is plenty of open ground which makes spotting mushrooms easier and safer than having to forage through brush. Parking is plentiful and free. There are extra mushroom gathering baskets for purchase at only 50 cents each. If you need a basket, please e-mail me and I will reserve one for you. Supply is limited. Check the discussion forum for what else to bring under "Mushroom Hunters Survival Kit" Please try to arrive as close to 10:30am as possible to get some good hunting time in. Look for the MLUSA sign at the Great Woods entrance. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions. Don't forget to bring your $5 annual dues if you haven't paid already. See you on the 19th!&lt;/p&gt;
