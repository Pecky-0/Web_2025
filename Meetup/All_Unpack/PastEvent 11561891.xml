So when I heard that the movie chronicling the creation of his final show was going to be in limited release, I had to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the trailer for &amp;quot;THIS IS IT&amp;quot; gives me the chills and I've already bought my ticket for 'opening day' October 28th 9:30pm at Loews Boston Common movie theatre!  If you want to join me I highly recommend buying your tickets in advance on Fandago.com (many shows are already selling out, and I don't know if same-day tickets will be available). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch Trailer:  &lt;a href="http://www.thisisit-movie.com/"&gt;http://www.thisisit-m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Ticket: &lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/michaeljacksonsthisisit_126972/movietimes"&gt;http://www.fandango.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; Michael Jackson takes a final bow in this theatrical concert film featuring rehearsal footage of the late mega star as he practiced for the 100 shows in London that never came to be in this Columbia Pictures release. &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet outside the theater at 9pm. I will email my contact information to those of you who RSVP yes, closer to the date.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet outside the theater.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ritesh</member_name><member_id>4789957</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256951350000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254841367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Michael Jackson "This Is It" Movie Night</name><id>11561891</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256778000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11561891/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/4/global_7611956.jpeg</photo_url></item>
