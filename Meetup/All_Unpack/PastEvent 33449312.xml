&lt;p&gt;By Lan Samantha Cheng (&lt;a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=17077"&gt;http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A haunting story of art, ambition, love, and friendship by a writer of elegant, exacting prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the renowned writing school in Bonneville, every student is simultaneously terrified of and attracted to the charismatic and mysterious poet and professor Miranda Sturgis, whose high standards for art are both intimidating and inspiring. As two students, Roman and Bernard, strive to win her admiration, the lines between mentorship, friendship, and love are blurred. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Roman's star rises early, and his first book wins a prestigious prize. Meanwhile, Bernard labors for years over a single poem. Secrets of the past begin to surface, friendships are broken, and Miranda continues to cast a shadow over their lives. What is the hidden burden of early promise? What are the personal costs of a life devoted to the pursuit of art?&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;All Is Forgotten, Nothing Is Lost&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a brilliant evocation of the demands of ambition and vocation, personal loyalty and poetic truth.&lt;/p&gt;
