You can drive and park there or get the T to Central square on the red line and walk about 10 minutes or you can get the green B line to Boston University West and walk over the BU bridge and to the park on the left as you cross the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Trader Joes across the road which could be a good place to grab some picnic foods/ drinks. If you want to bring a BBQ then please go ahead. I don't have one and noone has told me they are bringing one so I'll just do a picnic from Trader Joes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to drink (ofcourse) then we just need to be a bit discrete about it. Plastic cups, drinks in eskys, we should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who has a cricket set?&lt;br /&gt;Who has a football?&lt;br /&gt;anyone got an Esky or two they can bring?&lt;br /&gt;PLease let me know what you can bring...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come along, bring your friends, it will be a fun day kicking back in the park. See you on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll email my cell phone number to those who RSVP byFriday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  &lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217389755000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206828367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Australia Day in July</name><id>7629426</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217091600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/7629426/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/5/2/global_1121202.jpeg</photo_url></item>
