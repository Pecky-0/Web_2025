&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I am back and off to a great start finding this gem of a Restaurant in the Redstone PlazaÂ  in Stoneham. It is a huge 82,000square foot Hibachi Lounge and Steak house with a full fledged Sushi bar as well. I just walked through and it looks awesome and the prices are pretty decent. They also have Hibachi style where the cook will make it in front of you. I think we should try the party room route though that way we can order what we want. I need a minimum of 20 people for the space so there would be no charge. I was thinking of doing this next Thursday. There is a ton of parking as well. I will call the manager as soon as I see people signing up...The location is at the Redstone Plaza in Stoneham.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the back party room with Social Fun Group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy Blum</member_name><member_id>8796666</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339198773000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1338498194000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Asian Hibachi cuisine in Stoneham Joint Meetup with Social Fun</name><id>67159512</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339108200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/67159512/</event_url></item>
