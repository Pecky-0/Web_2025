&lt;p&gt;The 30th annual Walk Against Hunger takes place on Sunday, May 5, in Hartford. The event is a fundraiser for Foodshare and several other local anti-hunger charities. I hope you'll consider signing up, asking some friends, family, and co-workers to sponsor you, and coming out to join me. These days, Foodshare is needed more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sign up to walk, follow these easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) go to &lt;a href="http://www.foodshare.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.foodshare.org&lt;/a&gt; and click on the Walk Against Hunger logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) click on "Join a team"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) put "Gloria" in the search box and press search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) select "Gloria's Glorious Gang" and follow the steps to join her team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have signed up, you can raise money using the website tools to e-mail friends and family, or you can print out a brochure and go raise some sponsors the old fashioned way, with paper and pencil! Or, alternatively, if you want a paper brochure, send me an e-mail with your snail mail address and how many brochures you would like and I'll mail them. I can also mail a Walk poster or two if you have a place to hang it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Walk day, come to HartBeat Park, part of the campus of The Hartford, on Asylum Avenue in Hartford between 1:00 and 1:30 to turn in your pledges and get signed up. Look for Gloria near the stage about 1:45!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to The Hartford's main campus on Asylum Avenue, park in any of their lots, and Foodshare's great volunteers will direct you the rest of the way.  Walk starting point is the new Hartbeat Park, adjacent to the main campus.  Walk route is slightly shorter than in the past and will take us downtown and around Bushnell Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
