Our first get together will be October 5, 2010... This will be a joint meet up with SE Mass 20's and 30's couples. Lets meet up and test our knowledge, have fun, laugh, and enjoy.... If you are ordering dinner or drinks please be sure you have enough $$$ for your order and a tip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets meet around 7:30pm. I originally thought Trivia started at 7pm but I'm now told it starts a bit later. JUST FOUND OUT IT STARTS AT 8:30PM. A few of us should be early to be sure we have seats together. We can grab some food then too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Half Door in Quincy Center is your typical Irish Pub.
