Start planning your costumes now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we're going to have our costume contest with PRIZES, ribbons for the proud owners and toys for the dogs! Best costume and runners up 2-4. plus prizes for best puppy costume, best home made costume, most creative costume. This year, we're also going to have CONTESTS, more prizes and toys! - pug races by sex, and by age, best trick, cutest pug, best tail wagger, oldest pug, youngest pug, and my all time favorite - FATTEST pug. No fair stuffing your pug for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need people to bring Halloween snacks to this one, and if you bring home baked snacks for the pugs, make sure they are soft snacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 60 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host, and we'd certainly like to give Shar a break every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the pouring rain, only three people and two Pugs showed up to the very first Saturday Second Monthly Meetup, which was great, because after splashing around in the puddles for a few minutes, the Pugs, French Bulldogs, and people all decided to take the meetup inside!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In attendance were Lindsey and Alex and their 7 year old Pug, Sonya, who trotted from lap to lap and supervised the younger dogs, brand new member Jody and her 7 month old Pug Gus, who was absolutely thrilled by his new French Bulldog friends!, your organizer's 4 year old Pug, Clovis and 18 month old French Bulldog, Cletus, and foster French Bulldog, 10 month old Rocket - enough fuzzy faces to make a party.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gus, Cletus, and Rocket flew around and around the house, while Clovis and Sonja watched.  Everyone stayed dry and had a great time in spite of the rain, but let's hope the sun comes out for the next Saturday Second meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups and the South of Boston Small Breed Dogs Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Cletus's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>shar</member_name><member_id>2833949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224961507000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221419409000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug October Meetup</name><id>8756300</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224439200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/8756300/</event_url></item>
