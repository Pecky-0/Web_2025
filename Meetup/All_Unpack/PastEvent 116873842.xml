&lt;li&gt;Hey everyone, this will be the last Charlestown meetup on a Saturday. The reason being is two-fold: Number one, I am moving to DC at the end of May. Number two, most people will be playing in sand and grass tournaments on the weekends during the summer. However, Mark is nice enough to organize an advance meetup on Thursday nights at the same location. That will start on May 9th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have really enjoyed playing with everyone through this meetup and am sad about leaving. It would be great to be able to hang out one last time, so y'all are invited for lunch after the game to Ironside Grill, located right in Charlestown. When you message me to RSVP, please let me know if you are interested in coming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you can't make it, please change your RSVP on the meetup site as early as possible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And let me know if you are running late.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Those who cancel last minute, don't show up, or consistently come late will not be admitted to future meetups. If you are not on the roster, please don't come expecting to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is for Yankee C- and above level only. Players are required to know how to play a 6-2 and 5-1 formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. If not, it's a one-time $25 membership fee that is good for a year. When you come in, pick up an application at the front desk and pay them (not me). Those who paid at the Orient Heights Community Center can use their cards at this gym too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is non-residential street parking by the gym and a parking lot. Once you are on Medford St, take your first right and the lot is on your right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also 5 minute walk from the Sullivan T stop and Bunker Hill College stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
