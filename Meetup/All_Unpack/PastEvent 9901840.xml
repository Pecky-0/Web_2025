We'll need to spot cars on Gale River Road and Zealand RoadI would like to start with the twins and move on to Guyot, Zealand down the the hut and then up to Hale. Tis will be a long day traveling at a moderate to fast pace.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have a headlamp as we'll probably be coming out in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: New meeting place..... we'll start from 7 Dwarfs Motel. That automatically saves us 1.5 miles. From 7 Dwarfs walk down the road to the second driveway on your right. Follow the driveway behind a building to meet the snowmobile trail and a bridge. Cross the bridge the take a left onto the snowmobile trail. Follow that a short distance to where it curves right and on your left you will see an old bridge with some chain link fencing. Do not cross the bridge, but look for tracks leaving the snowmobile trail on your left following the river bank. This is the old path of the North Twin Trail. It is used by hikers and skiers. Follow this south, keeping the river on your left. It will join the snowmobile trail and river at a bridge just west of the summer trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in a Red Toyota Prius w/ maine plates</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239617498000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236432827000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Four Thousand Footer Extravaganza!North and South Twin, Zealand, and Hale</name><id>9901840</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239444000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9901840/</event_url></item>
