<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This discussion opens the Pandora’s box of issues relating to issues such as transhumanism in which proponents see the betterment of the human species through the intercession of technology: bionics, genetic engineering, etc. But the discussion can also tap into the subjects of artificial intelligence and robotics by which, some claim, it will be possible to engineer intelligent machines that are better or more human than their creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can transhumanism and artificial intelligence improve or perfect our all-too-human nature? Or are these technologies merely tools by which we human beings can learn how to enhance and expand our humanity? And what does it mean to be human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would a transhuman or a robotic philosopher sound like? Would robots buy philosophy books? Is philosophy the ultimate antidote for non-human humanism? And are humanity’s imperfections the essence and the inspiration of philosophy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a wealth of information on transhumanism and robotics on the internet, but my all-too-human laziness compels me to leave the surfing up to you.&lt;/span&gt; Well, perhaps I’ll add a few links before the meeting date…it depends on my mood…Shutting down…1012AI Fatal System Error …000 P00H1 111I2221L33 4O5S47O88P7H887Y001&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMAT:&lt;/strong&gt; When both big round tables are used, a designated half of each will move to the other table at approximately 8:45 pm in order to encourage mixing between the tables (each table accommodates up to 13 people).   After all, our events are as social as they are intellectual, and this format encourages the flourishing of both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOOD AND BEVERAGES:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This restaurant is extremely accommodating and allows us to stay until closing (11:00pm) if we choose.  It is not fair if they are not fairly compensated&lt;/em&gt;.  And we use a large percentage of the total seats in the house!  While a &lt;strong&gt;minimum&lt;/strong&gt; expenditure of $12 on food and/or drink is a group requirement, you are strongly encouraged to purchase a meal or its equivalent in cost (if your bill for food and/or drink plus tax and tip is under $12 the balance will be added to the gratuity).  Generally $20 (or a little less) will cover your entree, some shared appetizers, tax, and the gratuity but not drinks. To simplify, many folks just round off to $20 and add and adjust if they order drinks. &lt;em&gt;By attending this event you hereby agree to this policy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some of us head out for a late night prolongation of the evening at a nearby pub.  However, during these occasions please do not carpool to the pub: drive your car down the street and re-park it at the pub because there is TOWING after the little mall area closes for the night. &lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
