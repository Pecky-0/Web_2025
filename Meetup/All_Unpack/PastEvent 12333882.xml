If you don't have a camera, you may want to bring along a USB key so that you can take your pictures home with you. Alternatively, we can try to email them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be lots of fun. Space is limited so please be sure to RSVP with &lt;a href="http://www.abeille.us/shop" target="_blank"&gt;Abeille&lt;/a&gt;. We also ask if you could bring a snack or beverage to share with the group. Otherwise, it's free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lcanale</member_name><member_id>8176022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267463028000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263614924000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn to Photograph Your Work - Jewelry &amp; all requiring a lightbox (FREE)</name><id>12333882</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267290000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/12333882/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/f/c/global_10667884.jpeg</photo_url></item>
