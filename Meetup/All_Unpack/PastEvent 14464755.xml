<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have returned from the Canadian Rockies uneaten by bears.  I am still in recovery mode after 6 days with over 50 miles and at least 12,000 feet of vertical gain. Ragged Mt. is a trap rock peak on the New Britain/Berlin line.  We are going to do a 6.0 mile loop on the Preserve Trail.  This trail includes sections of the Metacomet and beautiful views.   I like Ragged for its climb at the beginning and great views.  The trail is not technical but does require effort to complete.  Hopefully the waterfall in the west side of the park is running. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail trap rock and forest.  We will head out in a clockwise direction up the cliffs first.  Make sure to bring water and snacks.  We should be out there no more than 4 hours.  The trail conditions should be dry and rocky.  I always recommend hiking boots and non-cotton clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a hiking GROUP.  That means we start together and stay together.  If this doesn't suit you then please don't respond.  Do not plan on an exact finish time as we are only as fast as our slowest hiker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always with me, NO DOGS-NO CHILDREN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are parking on West Lane in Berlin.  Its a small area so squish and be creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Berlin&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=%5B311-499%5D+West+Ln&amp;amp;zipcode=06037&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.6285&amp;amp;longitude=-72.80135&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Berlin Trail map&lt;a href="http://www.town.berlin.ct.us/filestorage/24/292/471/Town-hiking-trails%252520Model%252520(1).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.town.berli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
