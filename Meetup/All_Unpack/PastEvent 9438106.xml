Much of the decorative wood is over 150 years old. Two gigantic communal tables were designed by a local artist, and provide a lovely, unusual place to enjoy a pint. You'll also find drinks tables, pod tables, sofas and chairs.&amp;quot; Check out the photo page to see the beautiful interior of the Asgard: &lt;a href="http://www.classicirish.com/asgard_photos.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.classiciri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Asgard offers an eclectic menu with everything from traditional Irish pub fare to dishes from all over the world.  Here is a link to their menu: &lt;a href="http://www.classicirish.com/pdffiles/asgard-menu-11-11-08.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.classiciri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner we will be going over to the Boston Celtic Music Festival, but the Asgard will also have live music starting at 9:30 for anyone who doesn't want to go to the festival.  (The music festival is set up as a separate event.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Asgard also provides $3.00 Validated Parking in University Park Garage. (Some restrictions apply.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the meetup sign on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231801949000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231041520000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Irish Pub</name><id>9438106</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231628400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/9438106/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/3/global_1218899.jpeg</photo_url></item>
