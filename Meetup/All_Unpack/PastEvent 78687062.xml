*We will meetup at Heritage Farm - at the porch. I will have a meetup.com pin (or sign). Then, we can walk across to the Sampas Pavilion for the concert. If you show up later you can find us with a meetup sign in the back of either a chair or my hat. &lt;br /&gt;

You can purchase something from the Heritage Farm menu, ice cream, hot dogs, burgers, or beverage.... or you can bring your own snack. www.heritageicecream.com This is a shared event with other meetup groups. &lt;br /&gt;

WHERE THIS IS AN ALL-OUTDOOR EVENT, RAIN CANCELS. I will update as close to 6pm in the event the weather is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
