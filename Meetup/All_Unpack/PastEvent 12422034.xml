We'll play from 3:00 - 5:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who's up for knocking down some pins? Who's up for knocking back some drinks?  Do one or the other or both...either way we'd love to see you!  Come out to meet old friends and to make new ones.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often, members make plans to continue the evening at other venues after the pre-party, but if you have other plans for Saturday night that's fine too.  This time frame gives everyone the opportunity to run home to freshen up for a big night out, if you so choose.  Therefore, there's nothing to lose, right?!? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  &lt;b&gt;If you plan to bowl, please arrive promptly at 3:00 PM. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are only coming to socialize, drop in anytime between 3:00 - 5:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The following items are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; allowed at Kings:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work style boots &lt;br /&gt;No large Chains/Sunglasses &lt;br /&gt;Bandanas/Doo Rags &lt;br /&gt;Backpacks &lt;br /&gt;No over-sized shirts &lt;br /&gt;No sleeveless Shirts &lt;br /&gt;No outside food or beverage is allowed &lt;br /&gt;Please note, Kings staff reserve the right to search bags at any timeâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be made for a lane under ALWAYS LEARNING</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>32</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268079206000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264463279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre-Party: Bowling at Kings </name><id>12422034</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267905600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/12422034/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/5/global_12249269.jpeg</photo_url></item>
