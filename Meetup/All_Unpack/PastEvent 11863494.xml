Those interested in participating should bring along a matted print of one of your own favorite photographs to exchange. It's a great way to share your photography with the group and spread a little holiday cheer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The specifics:&lt;br /&gt;- Only your own photography may be exchanged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;- Prints may be of any size, but must be matted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;- Please sign the matte.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;- Unwrapping gifts is always exciting, and it adds an element of surprise, so please do wrap the matted print.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;- We'll draw names on the day of the event. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;- Have fun :-)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Happy Holidays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are looking forward to seeing everyone at our Christmas in Rockport and Group Holiday dinner, Saturday, December 19. We're hoping many of you choose to participate in the gift exchange as well. If you don't know what the gift exchange entails, please read more here: Christmas in Rockport and a CAPE Group Holiday Dinner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will take place rain, snow or shine. Please see below for details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Weather permitting we'll meet as planned at 1p.m. in Rockport. We'll wrap up around 3:30p.m. and head to Passports Restaurant in Gloucester for our holiday dinner. After dinner those who wish to do a little night shooting can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In the case of inclement weather we will only meet for dinner. Dinner is scheduled for 4p.m. at Passports Restaurant in Gloucester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you only plan to attend the dinner, please RSVP to let us know that you'll be joining us. I need to get Passports a more exact count next week. It isn't a large restaurant, and we want to make sure they're prepared for our group, so it's import to have you RSVP in as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passports Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;110 Main Street &lt;br /&gt;Gloucester, MA 01930&lt;br /&gt;978-281-3680&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be a great event, and we appreciate you taking time out to celebrate the holidays with us!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: black"&gt;For the CAPE Group's December event we'll photograph in and around Rockport, MA on &lt;b&gt;Saturday&lt;/b&gt;, December 19, at 1p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockport dresses up nicely for the holidays with a holiday wreath on Motif #1, a town Christmas tree in Dock Square, and Main Street lit with miniature Christmas trees as decorative lampposts. Tuck's Candy Store also offers free candy making demonstrations throughout the day, that depending on crowds, we may be able to shoot. If time allows, we'll also venture over to Pigeon Cove Harbor to shoot. Apart from the holiday decorations there are plenty of photo opps in this quaint seaside town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, after the event the CAPE Group will enjoy a holiday meal together at Passports Restaurant in Gloucester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet on &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=t-wharf,+rockport,+ma&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=61.411614,75.673828&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=T+Wharf&amp;amp;hnear=T+Wharf,+Rockport,+MA+01966&amp;amp;ll=42.658474,-70.615144&amp;amp;spn=0.003543,0.004619&amp;amp;z=18&amp;amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;T-Wharf&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at 1p.m.  Parking at the meters in Rockport is free during the holiday season, and there is visitor parking on T-Wharf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261684792000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258076537000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas in Rockport and a CAPE Group Holiday Dinner</name><id>11863494</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261245600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/11863494/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_3584529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
