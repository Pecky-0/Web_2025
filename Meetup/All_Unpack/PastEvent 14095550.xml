Is this a great film or only this year's model? Hmm...I don't know- do you? Should prove to be a very interesting conversation afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dogtooth&lt;/b&gt; is a darkly funny look at three teenagers confined to their parents’ isolated country estate, kept under strict rule and regimen. Terrorized into submission by their father, the children spend their days learning an invented vocabulary and living in an absurdist, nightmarish experiment—until a trusted outsider, brought in to satisfy the son’s libidinal urges, starts bringing gifts for the teens. A hyper-stylized mixture of physical violence and verbal comedy, &lt;b&gt;Dogtooth&lt;/b&gt;’s ruthless satire of middle-class mores heralds the arrival of an important new voice in world cinema. MFA Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Dogtooth&lt;/b&gt;” is like a car crash.You cannot look away. The Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos tells his story with complete command of visuals and performances. His cinematography is like a series of family photographs of a family with something wrong with it. His dialogue sounds composed entirely of sentences memorized from tourist phrase books. Roger Ebert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The children think Frank Sinatra’s version of “Fly Me to the Moon” is a recording of their grandfather sending out a message of paternal love and that ferocious cats who live beyond the gate have killed an invisible fourth sibling. “I’m going to give birth to two children and a dog,” their mother announces one night. Then again, if her son and daughters behave themselves, they may be spared further human siblings. The dog is nonnegotiable, though.&lt;br /&gt;Are mom and dad conducting some kind of perverse behaviorist experiment? Are they determined to shelter the younger generation in a world gone mad?  NY Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dogtooth&lt;/b&gt; isn't for everybody, but it will delight the adventurous.
