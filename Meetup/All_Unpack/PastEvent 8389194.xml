For children, summer is a chance to be free &amp;amp; to grow.  As adults we don't get summers off.  I challenge you to stop what you are doing for a few hours and come play with glue, images &amp;amp; your intuition. It is my hope that you will find your freedom &amp;amp; grow from what you have learned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soul Collage® is a process that is best described as a creative practice, much like journaling. You can explore and express your deepest self with it. It is a practice that is often a path to deep, inner healing, and sometimes to transformation. It is very intuitive &amp;amp; creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the unique pleasure of collecting images from magazines dated &lt;b&gt;1970-1980s!&lt;/b&gt;  Come see the amazing images!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This workshop is perfect for anyone!  No artistic experience necessary. All materials included. Light lunch provided including popsicles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost includes facility rental, all supplies, amazing images &amp;amp; lunch.  A great investment in yourself!  I have advertised this other places, we have 4 more people that RSVP'd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See some examples of cards I've made &amp;amp; sign up for the newsletter at &lt;a href="http://www.soulcollageworkshop.com" target="_blank"&gt;my website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kimee</member_name><member_id>112839</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226530786000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Intuitive artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>collage-106</urlname><id>1231011</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Above and Beyond Boston SoulCollage Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216743635000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beat the Heat with SoulCollage® </name><id>8389194</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218902400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/collage-106/events/8389194/</event_url></item>
