Enjoy the crisp air as we walk and chat. You'll find that time goes by quickly. Since Wollaston is so well lit, we will not need to stop as it get dark. Plan on walking 1-1.5 hours depending on the group consenus. Hopefully the weather will work out and we'll have a great night! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this event, please contact me.
