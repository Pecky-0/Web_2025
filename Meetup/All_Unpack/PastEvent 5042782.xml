We?re going to need all your support and more during this final stretch.  To help prepare us for what?s ahead and thank you for what you?ve already done, we?re throwing a 100 Days to Victory Party next Saturday, July 29.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You?re all invited to our campaign headquarters in Boston ? 85 Merrimac St. ? from 11 am ? 1 pm. Please bring your families if you?d like ? we?re all in this together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only with your support and help that we can win in November and make sure the Democrats don?t take full control of Beacon Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerry and Reed will both be here to thank you for all you?ve done. Hope you can be here to join us as well. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David J.
