The meeting is still a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to this next meeting and am looking forward to getting to know some of our newest members.  If you haven't been to one of our meetings before, or not for a while, come on down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please re-confirm your RSVP so that we all can get an idea as to how many will be attending.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dale Massicotte</member_name><member_id>5951349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258070869000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Russian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordrussianmeetup</urlname><id>723352</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Russian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257142720000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casual Meetup</name><id>11767897</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257897600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordrussianmeetup/events/11767897/</event_url></item>
