<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the first session for a biweekly game based in my homebrew world.  Please check out the website for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first session is going to primarily be for character creation, but the website has information for creating characters on it; this way everyone has an idead of what they're getting into before they arrive. I want everyone to sit down, get to know one another, and create characters together so we start off with a sense of party cohesion before we get going. If all that goes well before the end of the night, we might just start off with a little bit of actual play as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is on the street - there is no available off-street parking at our location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time may change, but no more than an hour one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring pencils/pens, dice, and your own copy of the PHB.  Bring your own refreshments - please do not bring alcoholic beverages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://geocities.com/kethothsepret/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://geocities.com/kethothsepret/" target="_blank"&gt;http://geocities.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1138744202000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mordane76's D&amp;D 3.5E Homebrew Game</name><id>4844711</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1139439600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/4844711/</event_url></item>
