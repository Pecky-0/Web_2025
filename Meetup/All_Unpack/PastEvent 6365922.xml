This walk will take you up and down Farmount's steep streets on a trip back in time past stunning and fascinating structures.&amp;quot; Sounds like a nice walk to me - I always like looking at nice old homes. I have driven nearby on Brush Hill Road and found it really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the parking lot of the Hyde Park commuter rail station at 3:00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we will have dinner at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;African Cuisine&lt;br /&gt;1248 Hyde Park Ave&lt;br /&gt;Hyde Park, MA 02136-2806&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (617) 364-9999 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They only open at 3 and sounded more interesting than anything else in the area, so we are doing a later walk - its all about the food this time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191956599000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189892682000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hyde Park &amp; Victorian Faimount walk/African</name><id>6365922</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191783600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6365922/</event_url></item>
