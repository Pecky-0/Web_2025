For some reason, I found that fascinating.

In this movie, Owen and Roberts are former secret agents out to scam their new corporate employers, but, of course, their characters will also be scamming each other!

[b]Update[/b]

6:40 is the time of the movie. I will be wearing my red meetup hat, and I will be in the theater lobby at 6:00. We'll walk into the movie theater about 15 minutes before showtime to get seats. (We've had some trouble sitting together because we don't all walk in early enough.) If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables at the front of the lobby in front of the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, I will be just behind the ropes across from the concession stand. If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

And I highly recommend buying your tickets online ahead of time at fandango.com.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

Oscar® winner Julia Roberts and Clive Owen reunite for "Duplicity," from writer/director Tony Gilroy (seven-time Oscar®-nominated "Michael Clayton").

In the film, they star as spies-turned-corporate operatives in the midst of a clandestine love affair. When they find themselves embroiled in a high-stakes espionage game, they discover the toughest part of the job is deciding how much to trust the one you love.

CIA officer Claire Stenwick (Roberts) and MI6 agent Ray Koval (Owen) have left the world of government intelligence to cash in on the highly profitable cold war raging between two rival multinational corporations. Their mission? Secure the formula for a product that will bring a fortune to the company that patents it first.

For their employers—industry titan Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) and buccaneer CEO Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti)— nothing is out of bounds. But as the stakes rise, the mystery deepens and the tactics get dirtier, the trickiest secret for Claire and Ray is their growing attraction. And as they each try to stay one double-cross ahead, two career loners find their schemes endangered by the only thing they can't cheat their way out of: love.
