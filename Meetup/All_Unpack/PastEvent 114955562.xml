&lt;p&gt;Lecture by Lawrence M. Krauss, the Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and Physics Department and Inaugural Director of the Origins Initiative at Arizona State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question “Why is there something rather than nothing?” has been asked for millennia by people who argue for a creator of our universe. Taking a trip back to the beginning of the beginning and the end of the end—and reviewing the remarkable developments in cosmology and particle physics over the past 40 years that have revolutionized our picture of the universe—we will explore the discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of both nothing and something. It has become clear that not only can our universe naturally arise from nothing, without supernatural shenanigans, but that it probably did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krauss is an internationally known theoretical physicist whose research covers science from the beginning of the universe to the end of the universe. His research interests include the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, the nature of dark matter, general relativity, and neutrino astrophysics. Krauss has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. The author of many scientific publications, he has also written several acclaimed popular books, including, The Fifth Essence, Fear of Physics, and The Physics of Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;
