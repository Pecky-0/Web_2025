In her talk, Andrea, a key teacher at the Insight Medication Center in Redwood City, CA, discusses how we create suffering by clinging to sense pleasure, views, rituals and rites, and identity/self. She talks about how we can bring mindfulness to support an understanding of the clinging in a way that helps us in letting go. Andrea presents in a clear and simple way that makes the teachings accessible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have a short meditation and our own discussion on the topic. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to become more aware and accepting in our lives. All level of meditators welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet people at the right side door (red) through the iron gate in the front of the church.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257376030000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257042331000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup: "Letting Go"</name><id>11758642</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257202800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/11758642/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
