&lt;p&gt;OK, esteemed colleagues. It's time for the 2013 SLED DOG RACES! Wooohoooooo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal. The Lakes Region Sled Dog Club (lrsdc.org) holds its races this weekend - I am planning for Saturday. I spoke to the organizer and she said we could photograph at the start/finish line - the race runs through and around downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first race begins at 8:30 - we should arrive by 8 a.m. I will plan to meet those of you going at the start/finish line. The next race doesn't begin until 12 noon and the final one of the day is at 1 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-between, there will be great shots of people, dogs, the town, dogs, more people, dogs. You get the point. After all, it is a sled dog race. There are coffee shops and pubs - depending on the time of day - or who cares about the time of day, we can stop in either or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us did this 2 years ago in Tamworth and it was great fun. Best advice: dress warmly. Hope to see you Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cynthia</member_name><member_id>8758507</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362287408000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photography Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastPhotographers</urlname><id>1528260</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast Photographers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361290932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, yowwwwlllllll ...</name><id>105336682</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362229200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/events/105336682/</event_url></item>
