He plans to either run a series of Living FR scenarios or a FR campaign. The game would run twice a month and characters are starting at first level though evil need not apply. &lt;br /&gt;Players looking for games or GMs looking for players are also welcome to come and check out what other games we currently have happening at the store. Right now we have have another 3.5 game that has just started on Saturday evenings. Along with two other established 3.5 games that run on Wednesday and Sunday nights.
