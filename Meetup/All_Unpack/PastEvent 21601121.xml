    &lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;
      &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;I have three tee times for
      Saturday at 1:45pm.&amp;nbsp; The cost is $61 incl cart which is
      mandatory before 5pm.&amp;nbsp; 
      &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;This looks like an
      interesting course and has received a lot of&amp;nbsp;recognition
      since its opening last April.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;The following are some of the
  press releases from their website.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;Shining Rock Golf
      Club garnered another accolade from GOLF Magazine in its
      &amp;ldquo;Best New Courses You Can Play of 2010&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;
      list that is appears in the January 2011 issue 
      
        &lt;span&gt;. 
        &lt;span&gt;The publication
        also designated Shining Rock Golf Club as the &amp;ldquo;Best 
        &lt;span&gt;Value&amp;rdquo; of
        the 10 rated courses selected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;About Shining Rock&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Just one year after opening in
  2010, New England golfers now have another "must play" course for
  their bucket list.&amp;nbsp; Dubbed "A diamond in&amp;nbsp;the rough" and
  "#4 New Course in America" by Golf Magazine, Shining Rock has
  already developed a loyal&amp;nbsp;following of golfers from
  throughout New England.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Carved out of a majestic 146-acre
  tract of rolling landscape that affords sweeping views of the
  historic Blackstone Valley Corridor, Shining Rock Golf
  Club&amp;nbsp;gives every level of golfer a memorable round. The par
  72 course measures 6,735 yards from the championship tees and
  each hole offers three to five tee boxes. With an elevation
  change of 255 feet from the highest to the lowest point on the
  course, golfers are presented with some stunning holes that will
  be talked about for their jaw-dropping and chiseled beauty. All
  18 holes have been named and many reflect the area's rich
  cultural and industrial heritage with designations such as
  "Kuttutuck," "Blackstone," "Quarry," "Rockdale," "Pemaogok,"
  "Towpath" and "Shining Path."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;The iconic and namesake Shining
  Rock is a sheer cliff of granite that sits prominently almost 80
  feet above the forest floor below and offers breathtaking vistas
  over 30 miles into Rhode Island and Central Massachusetts. The
  abundance of mica found in the glacial rock causes the formation
  to glisten in the sunshine after a rain and was a landmark for
  early settlers to the Blackstone Valley.&lt;/span&gt;
