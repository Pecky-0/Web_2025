<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>22 June 1936 - US Congress passes The Organic Act, giving the Virgin Islands their own constitution. It takes until 1954 for Congress to complete the necessary revisions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously Congress could use some better help with editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all familiar with the difficulty that comes with revising. Like Congress, we might throw something on paper and go with it, but then find that we need to work it over for 18 years until itâ€™s just right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to the workshop at the library tonight to help some fellow writers revise. Ray and Terry's works will be in the files section. Be prepared to discuss and offer suggestions. We would rather not have our members revising for two decades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask at the front desk.
