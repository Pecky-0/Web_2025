What are people finding in mysticism that they are not&lt;br /&gt;finding in the churches? Mysticism has never been about theological&lt;br /&gt;concepts and rules for “good” behavior. It is not about how to earn&lt;br /&gt;heaven or avoid hell. Mysticism always is about a soul’s profound and&lt;br /&gt;heartrending relationship with God. Why are mystics’ relationships with&lt;br /&gt;God always profound, and why does it break their hearts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us to learn what Christian Mysticism is, how it is practiced, and how&lt;br /&gt;you can begin moving toward a profound experience of the Love of God inside&lt;br /&gt;your own being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the presenter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rev.
