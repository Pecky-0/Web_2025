It has a panoramic view in all directions across Litchfield County from its 1325 foot elevation.  On a clear day you can see 30 miles.  This park was a gift to the state from Charles Senff in 1913.  The Civilian Conservation Corps did a great deal of improvements in the 1930’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 miles with an up hill climb.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 to 3 hours.  Rain cancels.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A state parking fee is collected at the entrance booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  96 Mount Tom Rd, New Preston, CT.  After entering, follow the park road to the end and loop around.  We will meet in the parking lot after the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=New+Preston&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=96+Mount+Tom+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk is being lead by Larry.
