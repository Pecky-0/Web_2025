We'll take votes for evening plans and arrange carpooling from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll plan on meeting at the Communter Rail lot at 10:30 a.m. to get us to the Festival probably around 11:30-noon for a full day of Irish-ness :-).  Will send my cell phone number to my yes's and maybe's this evening so we won't leave any tardies behind.  It is $2.00 to park your car for the day in the commuter rail lot (which will be at least $8.00 cheaper than any lot in Newport and equals the Jamestown Bridge Toll, so might be quite the steal:-).  Come prepared:-)&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Email Lisa with any questions!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220469240000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219277450000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newport Irish Festival:  Aug 30 </name><id>8587789</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220106600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/8587789/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/f/global_4486527.jpeg</photo_url></item>
