After the tour we'll all convene back in the ICA's great shop on the first floor. It's great for browsing, with many unique items. The ICA always has something new and they are celebrating their 75th anniversary. The ICA is free after 4pm on Thursdays, complements of Target. No sign-up fee for members that have payed their $10 joining fee. Just email the organizer if you are interested in signing up.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing something orange.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Q.</member_name><member_id>2269958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336744405000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335996209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA Boston) - Free Thursdays</name><id>qzmjqyqhbnb</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336687200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/63150162/</event_url></item>
