<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>All members of this group are welcome, whether or not they are Reiki practitioners. But if you have flu or a cold, please wait till you are over it.  This is to facilitate healing, so we don't want anyone to catch any &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a good idea to check for last minute cancellations. If less than 3 people RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, there will be no Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the hands-on session, members are welcome to remain to join in with another group arriving by 7:00  PM to view and discuss a DVD on Advanced Energy Healing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pristine pure well water will be provided, but please bring refreshments if you want something to munch on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do NOT go up the driveway with the &amp;quot;ULCS Clinic&amp;quot; sign.  Instead go up the first driveway with the &amp;quot;Meetup&amp;quot; sign.  It's not hard to find, but for directions call 603-286-8191. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you!
