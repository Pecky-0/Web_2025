Part 1 is on Thursday, June 28; Part 2 is on Friday, June 29. You can come to either or both. This spiritually based look at astrology will examine how your sun, moon, and rising signs relate to the lessons you need to learn in this life, the obstacles you need to overcome as you travel the spiritual path, and how you can work with your astrological influences to move toward a deeper relationship with God inside yourself. Thursday's seminar will cover the basic natal chart (the chart of your birth), describing what the symbols are and what they mean. There will also be an overview of what planets, houses, and signs mean, and discussion on how to interpret the most significant aspects of the chart. Friday's seminar will be a discussion of the characteristics and spiritual aspects of each of the twelve signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
