<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are starting an &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPEN MIKE on Wednesday Nites from 7PM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; until around 10PM near the Galleria Mall in East Cambridge.  After 10 should be more time to jam and play again for those who can stick around.  This is a great opportunity to further your music experience and career, jam with other musicians, play solo, play originals, and network.  The goal is to have everyone play as much as possible.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sign up procedure is basically &lt;b&gt;RSVPing for this meetup, answer the questions&lt;/b&gt; and then sign in when you arrive.  It's important to note what time you plan to arrive for scheduling.  Anyone who would like accompanyment please &lt;b&gt;submit 3 to 5 songs&lt;/b&gt; that you would like to play in order of priority, in the questions.   If you would like to rehearse the songs with the group come to the &lt;b&gt;jam/rehearsal meetup on Sunday the 16th&lt;/b&gt;.  If you can bring song sheets for your songs on one page that will facilitate playing.  If you are playing at semi-professional level and are playing solo or don't need to rehearse, just come to the open mike.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are also in the process of setting up 1 or two &lt;b&gt;house bands for the open mike&lt;/b&gt; (to open up and back up), and another for playing out at various events and gigs.   If you are interested please let me know (in &amp;quot;questions&amp;quot;) &amp;amp; try to come to the Sunday rehearsal(s).  I'm setting up an online group song repository spreadsheet for suggestions and voting, for the regular players.  Then we can determine the songs everyone likes most &amp;amp; focus on them for live performance.  If more performers are needed, we will be contacting wider musician networks, but our meetup and especially those who get in on the ground floor will be given preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to be in the house band(s) try to come early at 6:30PM and bring about 4 copies of 2 or 3 songs you want to play on 1 sheet per song if possible, so we can all play it.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm Bill, 6'4"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>9500592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274314310000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273633281000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Music Guild Open  Mike!</name><id>cscqnynhbzb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274310000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/13457355/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/global_11501162.jpeg</photo_url></item>
