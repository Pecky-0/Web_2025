If you'd like to do dinner, say so in your reply, and I'll try and make reservations.  Maybe now that lent is over, they'll let us, otherwise, you're on your own.&lt;br /&gt;This restaurant is NOT the friendliest, nor the most accommodating to our group, but I'll give them one more try, because of High Road.  Their website is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/highroadtheband" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably be able to make dinner, but I'll let you know as the time gets closer.  Dinner say at 7:30, just let me know in your reply, because if I don't go, others, who may want to go to dinner, will know if someone else is going, by reading the replys.  Save seats if you get there early.&lt;br /&gt;If you get there before the band starts at 9pm, I'll introduce you, otherwise once the band starts, I'll see you on the dance floor :)&lt;br /&gt;suz&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272239513000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
