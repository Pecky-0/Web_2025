&lt;p&gt;We expressively welcome anybody who lived for a while in a German speaking country. See you on Wednesday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not forget to RSVP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your humble organizer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Jacob Wirth is a German Restaurant in the theater district of Boston, that serves German favorites such as Bratwurst and Sauerkraut or Wiener Schnitzel. They also have Paulaner Hefeweizen and other German beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S.: There is parking right next to the restaurant, which is $20 (the deposit is NOT REFUNDED ANY MORE). If you like a walk in the Park, you can take advantage of the night special at the Boston Common parking for $11 flat. And off course with $3.50 gas prices, the T-Stop is Orange Line - Tufts Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm usually the guy in a red Meetup T-Shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaj Kandler</member_name><member_id>1142521</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325283354000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Christmas is over, the year is coming to its end.
