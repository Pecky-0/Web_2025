There are celebrations planned across the globe. As well, this Saturday is September 22nd... Frodo and Bilbo Baggins combined birthday! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We at Guard Up Family Swordsmanship are not ones to miss out on a good Hobbit celebration. As such, we are planning a Hobbit Day Party this Saturday at 4pm. At 4pm, we will be holding an interactive foam sword adventure for ages 6 and up (yes, teens and adults are welcome as well). Our staff will run the adventure based on "The Hobbit: There and Back Again". Rules will be explained at the start of the adventure. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

An award will be given to the best costume. Foam swords provided for those who do not have their own. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Following the adventure, we will enjoy a birthday cake befitting Hobbits along with potluck food or snacks that our guests are welcome to bring. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Pre-registration is required for this complimentary adventure as there are a limited number of spots available. Call (781) 270-4800 to register and let us know what dish you will bring.&lt;/p&gt;
