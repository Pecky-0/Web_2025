As he revisits the dreams they shared for a revolution that would transform Argentina he also grieves the tragic losses and examines his own choices. Through dramatic stories told by parents, siblings, friends and children of the disappeared, Mandelbaum shows what happens when brutal regimes attack the fabric of a country with great impunity, causing enormous suffering that lasts for generations. &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/calendar/event.asp?eventkey=35487&amp;amp;date=10/18/2008" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mfa.org/ca...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film starts at 7:00 in the Life Sciences Building. &lt;br /&gt;For directions to Trinity, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/AboutTrinity/VisitingTrinity/DirectionsToTrinity.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trincoll.e...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or call (860) 297-2053.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For campus map, see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/92062DC6-138A-430E-9ADA-5A209B506787/0/campusmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trincoll.e...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can come earlier than 6:45, please join us for supper in the Cave cafeteria (basement of Mather Hall, no id required).
