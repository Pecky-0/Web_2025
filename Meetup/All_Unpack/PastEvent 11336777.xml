But I'm going to TIVO Project Runway and learn about Anna Wintour - the legendary Vogue editor-in-chief.  She rules the world of fashion, of which I am a not-so-innocent bystander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The September 2007 issue of Vogue magazine weighed nearly five pounds, and was the single largest issue of a magazine ever published. With unprecedented access, this film tells the story of legendary Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour and her larger-than-life team of editors creating the issue and ruling the world of fashion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we'll get a bite after somewhere in Harvard Square.  The movie's at 7:30, so you'll get back home by 11:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, put on your chicest togs and join me in September at the September Issue.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After I'll be in the front right of the theater.  During the movie, I'll be sitting in the center.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252585512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Issue - Anna Wintour + Vogue  - What Could Be Better</name><id>11336777</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253230200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/11336777/</event_url></item>
