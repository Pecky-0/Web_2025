Distance Time Elev Change Trail / Waypoint Latitude Longitude starting at Mount Osceola Trailhead 43° 59' 01" 71° 33' 31" This trail begins at a parking area on Tripoli Rd. (FR 30), just west of the height-of-land in Thornton Gap 7.0 mi. from I-93, climbs over Mt. Osceola and East Osceola, and descends to the Greeley Ponds Trail at the height-of-land in Mad River Notch, 1.3 mi. south of the Kancamagus Highway. At the height-of-land on Tripoli Rd., there is a gate that is sometimes closed in spring and fall, so it may not be possible to reach the parking lot from the Waterville Valley side in a vehicle at such times. 3.20 mi 2 hr 41 min +2016 ft on Mount Osceola Trail 3.20 mi 2 hr 41 min +2016 ft This trail begins at a parking area on Tripoli Rd. (FR 30), just west of the height-of-land in Thornton Gap, climbs over Mt. Osceola and East Osceola, and descends to the Greeley Ponds Trail at the height-of-land in Mad River Notch, south of the Kancamagus Highway. At the height-of-land on Tripoli Rd., there is a gate that is sometimes closed in spring and fall, so it may not be possible to reach the parking lot from the Waterville Valley side in a vehicle at such times. The trail from Thornton Gap to the summit of Osceola is relatively easy, with moderate grades and reasonably good footing, but the section between East Osceola and the Greeley Ponds Trail is extremely steep and rough. The trail leaves Tripoli Rd. and climbs moderately with somewhat rocky footing, going east across the south slope of Breadtray Ridge. It begins to climb by switchbacks toward the ridge top, and the footing improves. A ledge on the left offers a view of Sandwich Mountain, and it crosses a small brook (unreliable). The trail resumes its switchbacks, gains the summit ridge and turns right, and soon reaches the summit ledge, with excellent views. A good outlook to the north can be obtained from a small ledge on a short side path, which begins at the older fire tower site that is located in the woods just to the west of the open ledge. to Mt Osceola 44° 00' 06" 71° 32' 08" 1.00 mi 40 min -150 ft on Mount Osceola Trail 4.20 mi 3 hr 21 min +1866 ft The trail then turns left and descends from the summit, alternating flat stretches with steep, rocky descents. Just before reaching the main pass between Osceola and East Osceola, it descends a steep chimney, which can be avoided by a detour to the left (north). The trail crosses the pass and climbs moderately with steep pitches past a fine outlook on the left, reaching the summit of East Osceola (marked by a small cairn). to East Osceola 44° 00' 22" 71° 31' 14" 1.00 mi 45 min +150 ft on Mount Osceola Trail 5.20 mi 4 hr 6 min +2016 ft The trail reaches the summit of East Osceola (marked by a small cairn). It descends moderately with steep pitches past a fine outlook on the right. The trail continues to descend then ascends a steep chimney, which can be avoided by a detour to the right (north). The trail then reaches the main pass between Osceola and East Osceola. The trail then turns and ascends to the summit, alternating flat stretches with steep, rocky ascents. to Mt Osceola 44° 00' 06" 71° 32' 08" 3.20 mi 1 hr 41 min -2016 ft on Mount Osceola Trail 8.40 mi 5 hr 47 min 0 ft The trail gains the summit ledge with excellent views. A good outlook to the north can be obtained from a small ledge on a short side path, which begins at the older fire tower site that is located in the woods just to the west of the open ledge. The trail descends to the summit ridge then switchbacks down the slope. It crosses a small brook and a ledge on the right offers a view of Sandwich Mountain. The trail resumes its switchbacks and reaches the south slope of Breadtray Ridge. It descends moderately with somewhat rocky footing, to its terminus at Tripoli Rd. to Mount Osceola Trailhead 43° 59' 01" 71° 33' 31" This trail begins at a parking area on Tripoli Rd.
