The very awesome Jamie has offered to lead a discussion of JK Rowling's latest work. (Seriously, you'll love Jamie. She's more fun than a barrel of monkeys). The tentative date for this meetup is Aug 9, 7:30 at the Trident Bookstore on Newbury street. The intersection of Newbury &amp;amp; Mass Ave (it's accessible by the orange and green line, as well as street parking around Newbury street, with luck on your side). &lt;br /&gt;But just so we don't ruffle some feathers if the winds change, the meetup MIGHT be moved to a later calendar date just to give members and newcombers time to pencil it into their schedules. We're all busy people, but bonding over Deathly Hallows is not to be missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she's also not shy about giving her email address out. So, jamielynn603@yahoo.com if you need to drop her a line.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cathy</member_name><member_id>4263429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187007821000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186015451000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harry Potter Meetup</name><id>6112329</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186702200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/6112329/</event_url></item>
