For those of you looking for an immersion experience, this is a good start for beginners as well as a wonderful reconnection for more experienced practitioners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The format is semi-structured, with some scheduled group time as well as plenty of optional experiences and free time to do as you wish. This house at Morse Mountain has some of the most spectacular views in the state, with virtually a 270 degree panorama of coastal water views. And it's only a 30 minute walk to one of the most beautiful beaches on the Maine coast - Sewall Beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our modest fee is a bargain considering it includes two night's lodging, dinners or Friday and Saturday evening, a seasoned meditation instructor to lead us in some group meditation, as well as a yoga teacher to lead morning practice on both Saturday and Sunday. Otherwise, we encourage attendees to bring any special food items and things for breakfast and lunch. The $85 fee includes two nights lodging (Friday and Saturday nights), dinners on both evenings (with vegetarian and vegan options), morning yoga, Saturday afternoon meditation instruction and practice, and amenities like tea, coffee and snacks during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to come just during the day or one of the evenings, please contact me and we can make arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us in mindful community for the special event as we seek to bring more awareness and presence into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1273449035000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265562208000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend Mindful Retreat @ Morse Mountain</name><id>12543326</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273266000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/12543326/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/3/global_12981411.jpeg</photo_url></item>
