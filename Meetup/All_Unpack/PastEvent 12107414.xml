Because of this we have not called in the reservation to Capri yet. We will be calling in the reservation tomorrow by 3:30pm. If your plans have changed/you donâ€™t want to be out in the snow please update your RSVP for dinner so we call in the correct amount for the reservation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capri is a fairly new Italian Grille on Salisbury Beach. They have a dining area, a great bar and an entertainment area, and the food is delicious, check out their menu or get directions &lt;a href="http://www.capriseaside.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.capriseasi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be eating dinner at 5:30pm and then walking right across the street to see the comedy show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take note of the RSVP deadline and update if your plans change as we must give a final count to the owner so that he can plan the setup of the dinning room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a separate event you can come to dinner and not the show what ever works for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note snow may cancel this event!
