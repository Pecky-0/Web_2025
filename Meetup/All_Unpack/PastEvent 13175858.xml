You'll find a stage for live music, darts, great food, and a drink menu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've talked with Rob personally and he offered to make us just about anything we like and will put it on the menu just for us. He has cheeseburger plates, BBQ burgers, chilli burgers, jalapeno and cheese burgers, pizza burgers with cheese and marinara and all come with home made fries. Rob also has BBQ chicken sandwiches, chicken fingers with fries and wings and fries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Jack's is known for Martini's and you can make any Martini drink you like and Rob will put it on as a special for $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music starts at 7PM. I will be performing at 7PM &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/natives/pages/http%3A//www.jodigriffith.com"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jodigriffith.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jodigriffi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/natives/pages/http%3A//www.facebook.com/profile.php%3Fref%3Dprofile%26id%3D817010575%23%21/pages/Our-Own-World/326093648355"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?ref=profile&amp;amp;id=817010575#!/pages/Our-Own-World/326093648355" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover is $7 and there is plenty of street parking.
