We'll meet in the parking lot at 10:45 am and begin our walk at 11:00 am.  The views and various wildlife are breathtaking, particularly at this time of year.  It's a perfect spot for birders so if you have binnoculars bring them along.  We'll all gather after the walk for lunch at Woodmans, a delightful seafood restaurant.  The address is 87 Perkins Row, Topsfield, Mass.  Please note there is a $1 meetup fee plus a possible entrance fee of $4.
