<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join me for a 15 mile run along the Charles starting at Panera Bread in Watertown this Saturday, at 8:00 AM. We did this same run last Saturday and it really went well-- the weather was gorgeous and everyone pretty much stayed at the same pace (9.5 minute miles). This Saturday is supposed to be wonderfully sunny, but considerably warmer than last Saturday, so if you're going to join us, please come well-hydrated. For those who want to run on Saturday but aren't quite up to 15 miles yet, feel free to to come along and just turn around earlier. As always, if you run faster than 9.5 minute miles, please bring someone to run with at your pace. The meetup location is Panera Bread at Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown. There is a free parking garage right there, so it's really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heidi</member_name><member_id>8485896</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250511328000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250179721000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday 15 Miles Along the Charles (Again)</name><id>11103812</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250337600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/11103812/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
