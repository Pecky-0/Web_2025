&lt;p&gt;The end of the summer is quickly approaching and I want to have at least one more cookout prior to the pool closing. Come on out, the pool is open, so bring your suits and towels. I'll provide the meat,&amp;nbsp;rolls and condiments. It would be great if you want to bring something to bring&amp;nbsp;a salad (pasta, potato, green) to share and/or dessert or snacky food. Bring your favorite game. We are an equal opportunity game playing group. &amp;nbsp;BYOB. &amp;nbsp;Bring a camp chair and we'll have a fire in the firepit in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking logistics: Please park in the CVS parking or funeral parking lot. These is parking along the street. Please do not block people from getting in and out of their driveways. Due to crabby neighbors please do not park in the front parking area or the side of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alergy alert: I have 1 dog name Princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring a dollar for our&amp;nbsp;awesome&amp;nbsp;organizer, Nina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hosting you guys.&lt;/p&gt;
