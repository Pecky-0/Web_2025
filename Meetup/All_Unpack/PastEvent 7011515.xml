Washington month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are listing this trip multiple times in February hoping that we are able to get one &amp;quot;good weather&amp;quot; day for our ascent. Please RSVP for as many of these potential dates as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet at 7:45 a.m. sharp in the Hikers Room of the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center (located on the lower level) for a gear check, safety briefing and to discuss the current weather and avalanche report. Due to the short days of winter we must be on the trail as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST be ready to start up the mountain at 8:00 a.m. Arrive early if you need extra time. We will NOT wait for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This event will only take place if the weather and conditions are favorable. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** We will need at least 3 confirmed hikers for this event to take place **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Due to the advanced and strenuous nature of this event you must have crampons as well as an ice axe and know how to use them **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Prior experience with above timberline travel during winter conditions is required **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** All hikers will be pre-screened **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Milton</member_name><member_id>4294409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204030232000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199280356000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt.
