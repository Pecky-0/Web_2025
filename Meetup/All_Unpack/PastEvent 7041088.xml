The Harvard Museum of Natural History has an exciting series of lectures and classes that address these subjects. After all, the more we know about ourselves and our planet, the richer our lives will be.  &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;This week's event is by pre-registration through the &lt;a href="http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;HMNH&lt;/a&gt; only.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Bacteria to Bones: Exploring the Rise of Complex Life on Earth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multicellular animal and plant life has existed for only a small fraction of the earth's 4.5 billion year history. In this class, we will explore the fossil evidence for the increasing complexity of life, from single-celled bacteria to the first algae and animals. Along the way we will discuss the most popular theories that explain the timing and causes of this transition, known as the Cambrian explosion. Hands-on specimens from Harvard collections and microscope slides will be viewed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructor: Phoebe Cohen Department of Earth &amp;amp; Planetary Sciences, Harvard University&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The $35.00 fee is set by and paid to the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
