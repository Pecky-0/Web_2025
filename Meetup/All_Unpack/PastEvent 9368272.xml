If we have enough folks the owner will put us next door where it will be quieter and we will have it all to ourselves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll use the time to get to know one another and to discuss not only the role of the organizer (and related war stories) but the ongoing direction of the group as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is open to all organizers, it's really a meeting focused on the Boston-area chapter of NE Meetup Organizers, which will be our focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ball Sq has awesome pancakes and eggs benedict, fast service and reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet out front, I will be have a black hat or motorcycle helmet</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236642957000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Organizers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NEOrganizers</urlname><id>321127</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>New England Meetup Organizers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229797225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Organizers Meet &amp; Greet Brunch - Boston Chapter (all are welcome)</name><id>9368272</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235314800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NEOrganizers/events/9368272/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/3/global_6690435.jpeg</photo_url></item>
