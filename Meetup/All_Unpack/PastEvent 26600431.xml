Let's do&amp;nbsp;one again! Let us each bring something we love and would like to share with the group. In the past people have brought&amp;nbsp;poems, tales, excerpts from plays or novels, but rarely have they thought to look into writers' confesional places, their diaries or personal essays.&amp;nbsp;Could some of us do some digging there? And so you know, Walter Benjamin is all mine. He says: " 
&lt;span&gt;Gifts must affect the receiver to the point of shock."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You will have up to five minutes to "shock" us. You may chose to participate or to simply listen. If possible, let us know in advance what you are planning to bring, and if you can, bring copies of the piece to share with the group (it makes it easier to follow).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312228220000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311291021000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Literary Reading</name><id>26600431</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312149600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/26600431/</event_url></item>
