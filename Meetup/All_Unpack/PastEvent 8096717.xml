<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Good meet-up last night.  Time to focus on our pre-Bastille Day fete.  Newport is an appropriate spot to celebrate this great French holiday as it served as the headquarters for the French army and fleet that assisted the US during our war of independence.  The battle of Yorktown was planned in Newport, and there are many brave frenchmen buried in our graveyards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am re-sending the original announcement for the benefit of our new members.  I will take care of the bread, wine and cheese.  Joanne is bringing brownies, and Pep and Cristelle are bringing cherries.  Can I impose on someone to bring strawberries?  We should be all set for lawn chairs, but I might ask that Pep and Richard each bring one just in case.  The two Elizabeths are each bringing CDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the original announcement (I corrected the parking instructions and added my telephone numbers):    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to a suggestion that we have a meeting in Newport this summer, I would like to invite all members of the group to a wine and cheese party to be held at my house.  At last Thursday's meeting we selected Saturday, July 12 (2 days before Bastille Day) as the date, and we picked the cocktail hour(s) - between 5:00 and 7:00 - so that you will be free to do something else before and/or after. I will provide the wine, cheese and bread.  Fruit or sweets would be welcome, but not necessary.  Please e-mail me at jdelnegro@hotmail.com if you intend to bring something, but once again do not feel obligated - if everyone were to bring something a lot would go to waste.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house - 2 Eustis Avenue - is the white Cape Cod at the corner of Bliss Road and Eustis Avenue.  There is a white picket fence in the front facing Eustis and a stockade fence on the side facing Bliss.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming over the Newport Bridge, do NOT take the downtown Newport exit, but instead continue on Route 138 until it dead-ends onto Admiral Kalbfus Road directly opposite the entrance to the Newport Grand Casino.  Turn left (east) onto Adm Kalbfus Road and go through two stoplights.  After the second stoplight, Admiral Kalbfus Road turns into Miantonomi Avenue.  I do not think there is any street sign for a while, but you will see a Sunoco station.  Go through this second stoplight (after it turns green) keeping the Sunoco station on your right.  Take a quick right on to Freeborn Street immediately after you go through that second stoplight.  Freeborn dead-ends into Bliss.  At the end of Freeborn you can see the stockade fence and the back of my house if you turn your head to the one o'clock position.  Turn right on to Bliss then a quick left on to Eustis.  My house is that corner house on your left.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming from Bristol or Tiverton, just head south on Route 138 (Broadway) until you come to the intersection of Broadway and Admiral Kalbfus Road/Miantonomi Avenue.   This is the same intersection described above, but you approached it heading south rather than heading east.  The Sunoco station will be at 11 o'clock.  Take the left before the Sunoco station, then a quick right on to Freeborn Street.  Once again, Freeborn dead-ends into Bliss and at the end of Freeborn you can see the stockade fence and the back of my house. Turn right on to Bliss and take a quick left onto Eustis just like those other guys who had to pay a toll for using the Newport Bridge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot park on Bliss Road or on the left side of Eustis (as you enter from Bliss), but there should be ample parking on the right side of Eustis or on any of the side streets a short walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house phone is (401) 848-4506 and my cell phone is (860) 205-3715. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The party is on come rain or come shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you have any French CDs that you would be willing to bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all of you will come, especially the new members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a bientot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>john delnegro</member_name><member_id>4845360</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216312323000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>providencefrenchlanguage</urlname><id>1145546</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>The Providence French Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212814457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Du pain, du vin et du boursin</name><id>8096717</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215896400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providencefrenchlanguage/events/8096717/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/5/global_4089333.jpeg</photo_url></item>
