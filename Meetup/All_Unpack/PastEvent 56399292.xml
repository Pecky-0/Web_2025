&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is free for everyone and there is no attendance limit.  The doors open at 11 a.m. and we plan to start cleaning up at 5 p.m.  During that time we will be offering some of our artwork for sale -- a perfect chance to find a last-minute Mother's Day gift, supporting both local artists *and* ArtStudio360! -- as well as a card-making activity.  Children are welcome at this event and we will have a few things for them to do as well.   Drinks and snacks are provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Applegail</member_name><member_id>26569312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336914708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331771913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ArtStudio 360 Open House</name><id>56399292</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336834800000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/56399292/</event_url></item>
