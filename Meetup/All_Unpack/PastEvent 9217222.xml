I've heard this party is fun but...the music is a little too loud. Just because we are over 40 does not mean we are hard of hearing! So, whoever the dj is please someone tell her to turn it down and more of us will show up! I am only addressing the complaints I have heard via from many of my members...Try it out and see what you think... One of our members Maria also tends bar at a new gay hangout in Worcester on Fri. and Sat. nites. We can also eat upstairs...We will try out Maria's place soon. Happy Thanksgiving&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 6874991</member_name><member_id>6874991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227922401000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gay Women Over 40</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>lgbtfriends-212</urlname><id>1155810</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>WEST OF BOSTON OVER 40 GAY WOMENS MEET-UP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227460589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dance Party</name><id>9217222</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227749400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lgbtfriends-212/events/9217222/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/0/global_4210720.jpeg</photo_url></item>
