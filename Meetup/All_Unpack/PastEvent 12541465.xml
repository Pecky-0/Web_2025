There will be entertainment, t-shirts and refreshments for runners, walkers and volunteers. Online registration can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/event_detail.cfm?event_id=1819802" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.active.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can email Michael&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;AfHB&amp;quot;dot&amp;quot;org if you want to sponsor the race or volunteer. We have two ongoing team competitions. Fastest school team - the BAC was the 2009 winner and the Fastest Firm team - Sasaki Associates were the 2009 champions and are the current holders of the AfHB Cup. Teams are scored with the fastest 3 runners from each school/firm and the times are handicapped for age &amp;amp; gender to level the field. We had over 300 runners in 2009 and the event is a lot of fun. All proceeds go to Architecture for Humanity.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael McHugh</member_name><member_id>1987659</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272895475000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265526722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>5th Annual AfHB 5k Run/Walk</name><id>12541465</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272722400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/12541465/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/4/global_2338596.jpeg</photo_url></item>
