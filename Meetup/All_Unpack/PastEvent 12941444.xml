But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world.  Born of a god but raised as a man, Perseus (Sam Worthington) is helpless to save his family from Hades (Ralph Fiennes), vengeful god of the underworld.  With nothing left to lose, Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Liam Neeson) and unleash hell on earth.  Leading a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds.  Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will only survive if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film will be presented in 3D wherever possible, making the gods even more formidable, the creatures even more fearsome, and taking audiences even deeper into the mythological realm of Perseus quest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://clash-of-the-titans.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://clash-of-the-t...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas Roadhouse &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Texas Roadhouse Story is simple.
