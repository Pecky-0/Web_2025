They have an extensive grooming system and make snow when nature isn't creating enough.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail passes are $14. If you need to rent equipment, it is another $14. They have both skate and Nordic ski packages.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS PRESIDENTS' DAY WEEKEND when RSVPing.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Weston Ski Track has 15 kilometers of trails. The track is actually made of a network of trails (also open for snowshoeing) that extends on both sides of the Charles River and create 5 different loops you can combine for several hours of ski.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good to know in advance&lt;/b&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information and trailmap available on site or online at:   &lt;a href="http://www.ski-paddle.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.ski-paddle.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;Restrooms in the main building     &lt;br /&gt;On-site: caf√© with snacks and beverages, water fountain, locker rooms for showers and changing     &lt;br /&gt;No reservation needed for the beginner lesson, but necessary for the lesson series: call (781) 891-6575     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the parking lot fills to capacity, go to the free overflow parking on the railroad side of Recreation Road     &lt;br /&gt;Weston Ski Track: 200 Park Road in    &lt;br /&gt;Weston, (781) 891-6575;    &lt;br /&gt;www.ski-paddle.com     &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Etiquette&lt;/b&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;Overtaking skiers must yield the right of way     &lt;br /&gt;Stopped skiers should move off the tracks to allow others to pass     &lt;br /&gt;Remove skis before crossing roads     &lt;br /&gt;Bring back your trash to the ski center     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy snow or rain cancels.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions?
