The normal meeting room is booked solid in September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For September 24th we are limited to the smaller Conference Room on the second level. There is a hard limit on the seating in this room, it's literally a conference table with chairs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are more than a few of you working on some interesting things, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm hoping to have up to 12 folks who are willing to discuss, for 5-10 minutes each, the projects they are working on, interested in, or need help with. This will be low key, the projector is available but not required for such a small group. It will be a great way to get early feedback from other developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be room for some &amp;quot;observers&amp;quot; at this discussion, but I prefer to have mostly active participants for this one meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Conference Room on the upper level</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255649202000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>iOS Developers &amp; Fanatics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nwiphone</urlname><id>1240376</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>Greater Boston iOS Developers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252254500000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>iPhone Developer Roundtable 9/24 7-9 PM</name><id>11303358</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253833200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nwiphone/events/11303358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/6/global_4989286.jpeg</photo_url></item>
