<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Alright guys, lets get our beer on. Soren has offered to host the event. I will grab a bunch of beers of different flavors and we can taste test them. Everyone please bring $10. The amount of beerage we can get will depend upon RSVPs we have. Hopefully we can get a good crowd together so we will have lots of tasting material. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be hosted at Soren's house. The address will be sent out on Saturday morning after RSVPs close. ( I will need time to buy the beer so I have to set a cut off time) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in hanging out but are not a beer drinker please note that in your RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all on Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Soren</member_name><member_id>8744593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276454105000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275529870000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beer Fest</name><id>13679501</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276376400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/13679501/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/global_5316331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
