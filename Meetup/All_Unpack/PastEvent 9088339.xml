And they have an effect on our real estate investing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and join the conversation.  Learn what strategies others are following, what is working, what is not today.  There are ALWAYS ways to make money in real estate!  New and experienced investors share ideas, answer questions, network on deals.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to several real estate groups each month.  I am finding more and more newbies coming out now.  A good sign for real estate investing!  There are more bargains today than in our lifetimes, and buyers are starting to arrive on the scene.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmest regards,&lt;br /&gt;Annie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and go down the stairs to our meeting room on the lower level.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231201645000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225761111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club December Meetup</name><id>9088339</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228176000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/9088339/</event_url></item>
