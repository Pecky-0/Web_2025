Is there a connection between programming computers and writing a story? There do seem to be several SF writers who have come from the various realms of IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, the structure necessary to write a good story is like the structure necessary for a computer program; you must lay out the steps needed to solve a problem. On the other, you can never leave a computer program in a non-functioning state; whereas once you have a story in working order, you feel like you've found gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge: If you've ever done any programming, does it feel like writing to you? &lt;br /&gt;If you haven't, is there anything else you do that puts you into a similar state of mind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: Writing code and writing words--Compare and contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;Open Discussion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208446186000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205013795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers April Meeting</name><id>7493134</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208116800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/7493134/</event_url></item>
