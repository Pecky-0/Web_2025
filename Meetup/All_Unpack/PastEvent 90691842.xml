&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Point Tavern!!!! Try 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : line-through"&gt;So the hurricane is coming! Whether you it the Frankenstorm or Sandy, the threat of rain put the kabash on my original plans for this week, so we're going to Plan B!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Plan C!&lt;/strong&gt; Which is to TRY AGAIN, this time with no threat of a hurricane and only blue skies and an almost 65 degree forecast - go figure!&lt;span style="text-decoration : line-through"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Point Tavern is a cozy, warm bar complete with low lighting, booth and bar seating and a "grad" clientele. The Point is a great place to cozy up, hang out with friends, reminisce about the storm and comment on the crazy warm weather we're having now. No matter what you talk about, we always have a good time regardless. This is one you'll want to know about and you'll be back - no matter WHAT the weather!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One caveat - the drinks are great, but there's no food. HOWEVER, you can order from any fine Providence establishment for delivery, select from one of the restaurants along Wickenden Street and bring it in, OR if you like, bring something from home. Options abound! Duck &amp;amp; Bunny is right next store too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on dialing for dinner or opting for catering from Chez Elsbeth and planting myself for a few hours of social fun and good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Not even hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're hard to miss!!!
