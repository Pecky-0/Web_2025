A look at the top 10 most free states in the US at this time, how they vary, and a discussion about what the ideal objectivist/libertarian free state would look like. Time:5pm - dinner and the salon will start at 7. We will have chili, bread, salad, chips and snacks. People should bring their favorite dessert, side dish or appetizer to share with others. No alcohol please. Place: Our house, Derry NH. Will email address to all who RSVP. Why: Because I really miss you guys. You get to see my home, my baby and smell the free New Hampshire air.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>PÃ¤r</member_name><member_id>3483132</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316348873000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315623026000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salon: What Constitutes a Free State?</name><id>32965912</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316293200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/32965912/</event_url></item>
