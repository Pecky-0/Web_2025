Neurologist Chris and Artist Annie had the perfect life until they lost their children in an auto accident; they're just starting to recover when Chris meets an untimely death himself. He's met by a messenger named Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and taken to his own personal afterlife--a freshly drawn world reminiscent of Annie's own artwork, still dripping and wet with paint. Meanwhile a depressed Annie takes her own life, compelling Chris to traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie follows Chris’ journey to uniting with his deceased family in the afterlife… wherever that may take him! It shows us that everyone’s idea of heaven is different, as well as what form we may take as our higher self. There are no limits to the imagination! This story will touch your soul, and astonish you with the unforgettable special effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be presenting this magical film on an LCD projection screen for optimum quality! Come join us on the journey through life after death!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273444654000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270583050000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>What Dreams May Come - Movie and Discussion</name><id>13105312</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273271400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/13105312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/4/global_9559044.jpeg</photo_url></item>
