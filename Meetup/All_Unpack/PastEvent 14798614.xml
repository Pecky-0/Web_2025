The closest (free) parking I can think of is on Mt Auburn St which isn't too far away. There's also parking in the Harvard Square area, but you'll have to drive around. If I think of more parking tips I'll post them later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will loop around the Charles for between 3 to 5k depending on what folks want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come even if you're not a great runner - I'm not either!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bernard</member_name><member_id>7094823</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284842211000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284686851000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casual Saturday Run - on the Charles</name><id>14798614</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284827400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/14798614/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
