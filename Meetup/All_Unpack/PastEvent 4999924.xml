Come support this new series of events and have loads of hiking and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group will hike the route around Breakneck Pond. Bring a lunch, bug spray, and a bathing suit if you want to swim in the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow Hollow State Park and the adjoining Nipmuck State Forest offer over 9,000 acres of recreation opportunities including miles of hiking trails and an 18-acre pond in Eastern Connecticut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 9 AM at the I-84 exit 68 &amp;quot;park and ride&amp;quot; lot before entering the park. You can also condense cars at that time to minimize the entrance fee. There is a $7 CT resident/$10 non-resident per car entrance fee to the park. Carpooling is encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually bring a spare kayak. My other one sinks a lot from all of the alligator bite holes.....&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1151517829000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crosslisting With Michelle's Hike and Kayaking Event</name><id>4999924</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1151758800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/4999924/</event_url></item>
