January is &amp;quot;Fire and Ice&amp;quot; so they are showing &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216487/" target="_blank"&gt;The Girl Who Played with Fire &lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from 2009.  It runs 129 minutes and is in Swedish with subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission to the movies is included in your admission to &amp;quot;First Thursday.&amp;quot;  I try to come to each film but sometimes work late, so don't let that stop you.  Other meetup groups also attend and you might join one of them if you don't find other movie meetup people.  Since many of the movies are more of an indie type I don't post all of them for this group so you can cross-check there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294365237000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293967291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"The Girl Who Played Wth Fire" @ First Thursday</name><id>15882838</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294361100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/15882838/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_5165560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
