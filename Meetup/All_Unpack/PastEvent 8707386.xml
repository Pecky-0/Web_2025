<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the newly formed &lt;br /&gt;Western MA PUG Meetup group!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you will be able to join our monthly meetup, in order to meet other pugs and pug parents and give our little ones time to play and socialize. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet the first weekend of the month - either saturday or sunday. For now, our meetups are held at a private residence - the home of Milo (1 year old) and Binxy (6 years old). We have a large fenced-in backyard, so the pups can run around without worry. As the weather gets colder, we'll be looking for an indoor venue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to meeting you and your pugs!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Marianna&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225545043000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners and Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernMApugs</urlname><id>1207399</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220800050000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Western MA Pug October Meetup</name><id>8707386</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223215200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernMApugs/events/8707386/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/1/global_4651329.jpeg</photo_url></item>
