Come attend a lively discussion on nutrition for the toddler and preschooler, as well as information on making your babyâ€™s transition to solid food an enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a healthy diet is variety, balance, and moderation. Topics that will be discussed include how and when to wean from the bottle or breast, when to introduce solids and textures to your baby, meal and snack patterns, portion sizes, picky eaters, and healthy breakfast and lunch ideas for daycare or home. There will be time to exchange ideas so bring your questions and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
