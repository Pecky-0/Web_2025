Hikes will be taken at a slower pace, with gains of 1000 feet or less and most will be 3 - 4 miles and take about half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4.6 mile hike with an elevation gain of only 925 feet, even though the mountain is 2,473 feet.  Total time about 3.50 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lovewell Mountain is a 2,473 feet monadnock associated with the Sunapee Ridge in southwest New Hampshire. The mountain is traversed by the 50 mile 80 km Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway and offers vistas from several ledges near its summit. Much of the mountain is wooded with species of the northern hardwood forest type; stands of coniferous red spruce are common on the mountain's higher elevations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The east side of Lovewell Mountain drains into the Beards Brook watershed, then into the Contoocook River, then the Merrimack River and the Atlantic Ocean. The west side drains into the North Branch watershed via a series of lakes and unnamed streams then joins Beards Brook just before its confluence with the Contoocook River.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info and a map here: &lt;a href="http://www.hikenewengland.com/Lovewell070505.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hikeneweng...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Even though this hike is for those of us just starting out (or starting again) please be prepared for a walk which may feel strenuous at times! Bring proper clothing (no jeans, decent hiking boots, a jacket) and carry at least 2 quarts of water and some snacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lovewell Mtn. is located in Washington, NH and can be accessed from Rt. 31. Washington is a few towns west of Concord.&lt;br /&gt;From Rt. 31 in Washington Village:&lt;br /&gt;    * Turn east onto Halfmoon Pond Road at the Washington town bandstand (this is a right-hand turn when heading north on Rt. 31; a left-hand turn when heading south).&lt;br /&gt;    * Follow Halfmoon Pond Road for about 2.4 miles (bear left at a fork with Mill St. and drive past the &amp;quot;dead end&amp;quot; sign). You will drive by Halfmoon Pond on the left.&lt;br /&gt;    * Turn right onto a rough jeep road (Lovewell Mtn. Road) and park here.&lt;br /&gt;There is limited parking at the jeep road. Park on the shoulder being sure not to block traffic on either the jeep road or Halfmoon Pond Road (although the jeep road is unlikely to have traffic). If there's no room to park there, you may have to backtrack 0.5 mile and park at Halfmoon Pond's boat launch area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am going to be camping at Pillsbury State Park for the weekend.  This is a primitive site with minimal facilities and remote sites.
