For example, you must believe that what you are asking for is possible, that it's fully desirable and worthwhile in every way, and that you are worthy of receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if you don’t? Sometimes “faking it” will work, but sometimes it just isn’t enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this meetup we'll be &lt;i&gt;walking&lt;/i&gt; you through a new belief change process that will allow you to change a belief that is holding you back from allowing, to one that opens you up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How good is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also have our open discussion time; so bring your questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It's very important to us that if you RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;, to please show up. People have been getting better about this, and it is so helpful. Remember, if you need to change your plans, please change your rsvp or let us know. It really helps us with our planning, having less waste (handouts and food), and in being able to start on time. Thank you so much for cooperating with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to back of front lobby, near water cooler and go upstairs.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6516126</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253918604000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250636777000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> September Meetup - A Walking Belief Change Process</name><id>11142742</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253055600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/11142742/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/global_7566145.jpeg</photo_url></item>
