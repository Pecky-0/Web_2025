<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The weather starts to get cooler in September, and it's the perfect time to enjoy the Salem Willows before the mad tourist rush of October.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 7:00 outside of the casino.  Feel free to come earlier to grab a bite to eat or we can all get food and ice cream after some games. If you've never been to the Willows then you're in for a treat, as the arcade and the casino are a blast. I for one am very excited about skeeball and that wonderful horse-racing game we discovered at our last Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it at 7:00, don't worry, we'll see you when you get there.  For use on that night should you not be able to locate us, David's number is 812-240-3236.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in front of the Casino</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221433549000</updated><rating><average>4.44999980927</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219457832000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday night at the Willows</name><id>8602369</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221260400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8602369/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/a/4/global_4204260.jpeg</photo_url></item>
