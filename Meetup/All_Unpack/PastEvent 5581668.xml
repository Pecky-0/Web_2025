The laotong, Snow Flower, introduces herself by sending Lily a silk fan on which she has written a poem in nu shu, a unique language that Chinese women created in order to communicate in secret, away from the influence of men.  As the years pass, Lily and Snow Flower send messages on the fan and compose stories on handkerchiefs, reaching out of isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.  They both endure the agony of footbinding and together reflect upon their arranged marriages, shared loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood.  The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive.  But when a misunderstanding arises, their deep friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the Starbucks we meet at in Newton Center is the one right at the T-Stop (as there are two Starbucks in Newton Center).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to RSVP, even if it's 'no':( or update your RSVP -as the date gets closer-so I know who's coming and can arrange seating. Looking forward to seeing recent and new members.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sabina</member_name><member_id>1638720</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178249855000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174248354000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Brookline Book Club April Meetup</name><id>5581668</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177873200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/5581668/</event_url></item>
