&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

We size up people and situations every day, making judgments in less time than it takes to blink: Should I trust this woman? Is that man competent? Is this person telling the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are finding that how our brains perceive and process information—neurocognitive processes involving the interaction and interplay of genes, socialization, and environmental stimuli—affects the beliefs we hold and the assumptions we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dive into the exploding field of decision-making and the nuances that influence everything from job interviews to presidential elections and more.&lt;/p&gt;
