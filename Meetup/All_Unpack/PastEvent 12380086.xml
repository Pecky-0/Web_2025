<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We have a lot of musicians in the group, and the last one of these was highly enjoyable, so we're well overdue for a second go around. &lt;br /&gt;If you can play an instrument (something portable, hopefully) or sing, and feel like just getting together and jamming, show up. :) If you are horribly shy about your musical skills and still want to come, show up.&lt;br /&gt;Genres were diverse, including rock/folk/pop etc.. jazz standards may come into play, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll serve nibbles and some libations. If you have something special you like, you're welcome to bring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call if you want more details: 860 465 9044&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space is limited, so be serious if you RSVP yes ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>White colonial house in the historic district of Chaplin Center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1268433236000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264051777000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another Jam Session @ Victoria's</name><id>12380086</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266708600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/12380086/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
