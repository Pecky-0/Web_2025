I plan to ski until noon and then have lunch in the lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windblown is the ultimate New England cross country ski experience with a wonderful lodge, bring your lunch or buy it there (I'm pretty sure they will have the cafe fully open but call to be sure if you are not bringing lunch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start at 10 am and will be just outside the lodge at the ski rack ready to ski. I'll be wearing a navy blue jacket that says SWIX on it and will start skiing at 10:10. Sorry we cannot wait for you because it is cold and we need to get moving to stay warm! Arrive early so you can buy your trail pass and get ready to ski before we meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow at least 1.5 hours driving time from the Boston area. Trail passes are $18--CASH OR CHECK ONLY!!! Rentals available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact each other for carpooling! Use the discussion board!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>2015761</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357096144000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356917386000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Years Day at Windblown</name><id>97137792</id><headcount>6</headcount><duration>12600000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357052400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/97137792/</event_url></item>
