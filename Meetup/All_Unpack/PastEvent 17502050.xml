&lt;p&gt;Legendary film producer David O. Selznick (Carl Back) is five weeks into shooting Gone With the Wind when he realizes the script is awful and the director doesn't have a clue. He has five days to replace them and restart the shoot or the production shuts down. Selznick calls Victor Fleming (Dave Breski) from the set of The Wizard to Oz to direct, and he taps legendary playwright, screenwriter and "script doctor" Ben Hecht (Mike Devine) to rewrite the script. There's only one problem - Hecht hasn't read the book. Over the course of five madcap days, the three men, assisted by Selznick's assistant, Miss Poppenghul (Katie Beatty), frantically craft one of the most beloved screenplays of all time, as Selznick and Fleming act out the book for Hecht and the phone rings off the hook with calls from the likes of Vivien Leigh, Louis B. Mayer and Ed Sullivan. The play is written as farce, but the characters also deal with serious questions about race and the tenuous power of Jewish executives in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Barbara will be wearing her Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Pin!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305556029000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>UPDATE!!
