&lt;p&gt;This is a class for people who think they can't draw. There are techniques we will use which have been developed to help us connect to the right side of our brains.* &lt;br /&gt;

The right side is our creative side, the left is our logical, analytical side. To be able to draw realistically involves turning off the left &amp;amp; tapping into our right brain. &lt;br /&gt;

With the help of a glass of pinot &amp;amp; artist Connie Festo Lafond, we will learn a couple of ways to keep the left side out of our artistic efforts &amp;amp; stay on the right side, in this fun class. &lt;br /&gt;
