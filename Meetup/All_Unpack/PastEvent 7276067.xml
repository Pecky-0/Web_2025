A flyer is posted in the files area of this site and the organizers' announcement follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Monadnock 9/11 Truth Alliance and Student Scholars for 9/11 Truth is hosting an event with founder of Scholars for 9/11 Truth, James H. Fetzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any questions, contact:  Justin Martell: 860-575-4293&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Was 9/11 an 'Inside Job'?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaker:  James H. Fetzer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application of scientific reasoning to 9/11 demonstrates that virtually everything we have been told about the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and Shanksville is not only untrue but provably false.  Was there more to the &amp;quot;collapse&amp;quot; of the Twin Towers than plane impacts and fires?  Was the Pentagon hit by a Boeing 757?  What happened in Shanksville?  Were 19 Islamic terrorists responsible for this attack?  Who is Philip Zelikow and why should his area of expertise matter to you?  What happens when independent experts and scholars who don't have an axe to grind look at the evidence?  100+ slides and video clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James H. Fetzer, McKnight Professor Emeritus at the University of Minnesota, who taught on the Duluth Campus, has ublished more than 20 books in the philosophy of science and on the theoretical foundations of computer science, AI, and cognitive science.  A former Marine Corps officer, he founded Scholars for 9/11 Truth and manages its web site.  He has edited the Scholars' first book, &lt;b&gt;THE 9/11 CONSPIRACY&lt;/b&gt; (2007), and organized and moderated its first conference, &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;The Science and the Politics of 9/11&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;, DVDs for which have just been released.  He has also appeared on hundreds of talk shows, including with Laura Ingraham, and television programs, including &amp;quot;Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The O'Reilly Factor&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scholars web site:  &lt;a href="http://911scholars.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://911scholars.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Academic web site:  &lt;a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfetzer/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.d.umn.edu/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Justin A.
