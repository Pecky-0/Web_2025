Bring your grammar questions, or any books you think are helpful. We'll start with introductions or an icebreaker...activity to be decided later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, let's meet again at the Boston Public Library, since everyone knows how to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's sit at the same table, and meet around 6p!&lt;br /&gt;After you enter the library, pass the checkout counters. Before the doorway into the stair hall, turn left into the first reading room with books. We will meet at the first table on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there, it's next to the Green Line T- Copley station, and near the Orange Line T -Back Bay station.&lt;br /&gt;Reece&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1125010847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston English as a Second Language September Meetup</name><id>4754461</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1127426400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/4754461/</event_url></item>
