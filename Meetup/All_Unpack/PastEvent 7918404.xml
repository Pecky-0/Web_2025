Last week traffic increased my commute by a half-hour, and I didn't have a backup plan in place to help get the Meetup going.  However, there were a few of us who showed up and tossed the disc, which was a good deal of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toward the end of last weeks meeting several other groups of people arrived at the Common and began playing frisbee.  I spoke with several of the people, and they all expressed an interest in a weekly get-together.  I will make a concerted effort to continue to spread the word, but in the short-term I think that word of mouth could be a great way to get more people involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on their comments and my own late arrival, I am posting the next two meetups to start later in the evening.  Right now it is light enough to legitimately play until 8 pm, so a 6:45 start should offer sufficient play time while giving more flexibility for evening commuters.  Flyers have been drafted, and I'll begin placing them around town this week.  I'll also cross-post the event on the Salem Board Game meetup, New in Town meetup, and on Craigslist.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211064912000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210538223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Frisbee on the Common, 5/15/2008</name><id>7918404</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210891500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7918404/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/e/1/global_3911857.jpeg</photo_url></item>
