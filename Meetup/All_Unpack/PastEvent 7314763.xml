<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Susy and Jen have graciously offered to host a game and movie night in Newburyport.  It will be a themed night with the glorious theme of CANADA.  Sound like a good time, eh?   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll kick of the night in their building's private screening room, where everyone will get their own private recliner, to watch the Oscar-nominated &lt;i&gt;Away from Her&lt;/i&gt;*, written and directed by Canadian Sarah Polley.  Then, we'll switch into game-playing mode for a round of Canadian Trivial Pursuit.  For those without much knowledge of our neighbors to the North, and who don't feel up to studying about the Confederation, please feel free to bring other games of your choice.  There is also a pool table available. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie snacks will be provided, but please feel free to bring any of your favorites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note: this Meetup does have a small and very strict attendance allowance because of condo rules for the screening room.  There will be no &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; RSVPs allowed and no tag-ons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People can park in any spot where the number is blacked out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Our hosts do reserve the right to change this selection to &lt;i&gt;Canadian Bacon&lt;/i&gt;, the movie, not the ham.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205275884000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202791299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canadian Night!</name><id>7314763</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1205024400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7314763/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/9/1/global_3207985.jpeg</photo_url></item>
