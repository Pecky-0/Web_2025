It has turned  into a massive celebration with events happening in hundreds of cities  around the world, inspiring creatives worldwide. Drawing its name from  the Japanese term for the sound of conversation "chit chat," it rests on  a presentation format that is based on a simple idea: 20 images x 20  seconds each. It's a format that makes presentations concise, and keeps  things moving at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the presentors is Photographer Lynne Damianos who will be presenting her self-published book project "The Bancroft Building and Its People: 100 Years of History."&lt;/p&gt;
