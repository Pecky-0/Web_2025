&lt;p&gt;I know....FINALLY....our next meeting scheduled for the 22nd, will be at the Grand Canal,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;located at 57 Canal Street, downtown Boston, &lt;span&gt;between Chapel Pl &amp;amp; Market St.  For those&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;who wish to take public transportation, the nearest T station is&lt;/span&gt; Haymarket Station - Outbound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Orange Line) Haymarket Station - Inbound (Orange Line).  When you come into the Grand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canal, you want to take a right and go down a small set of stairs and we'll be meeting in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for parking, unfortunately I could not find a venue that had free parking and to be located in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the downtown Boston area.  The Grand Canal is located very close to the T.  So I hope that helps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who are concerned about parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A couple of things:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Please make sure to take care of your bill before you leave if you choose to order something.  I took care of a bill that was not paid by someone.  It does not look good for the group when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Starting at the next meetup, the fee will be collected at the beginning of the meeting.  I've discovered that this is the norm and easier to keep track of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your patience and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
