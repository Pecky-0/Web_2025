&lt;p&gt;*** I am modifying the dates. I will be there at the campsite on July 2nd and coming back on July 8th. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a camp site in Lafayette State Park camp grounds from June 30th through July 6th. I will be doing 3 or 4 4K footers during this week. Each campsite can have up to 2 tents for 4 adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am offering this out to the group to join me for these hikes. There are several other camp sites still available around my site, (#13), but they will start to fill up quickly. You can join me for the day or for the week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on hitting Kinsman North, Flume and Garfield at this point in time but this can change based upon a lot of different factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you've ever wanted to climb a 4,000 footer - now's your chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only requirement I have is that you be physically capable of enduring up to a 9 hour hike with elevation gains around the 2K foot mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, please send my a private email so we can coordinate the trip up north. Note, from Leominster, it's approximately a 3.5 hour drive to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick Combs</member_name><member_id>9436949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341273208000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336260794000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4K Peaks</name><id>63583012</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341261000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group/events/63583012/</event_url></item>
