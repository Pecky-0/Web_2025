Tunes from traditional jazz canon and beyond. In a metro area so full of musicians, there are too few opportunities to jam regularly and informally. I also want people from this group to play gigs with each other, shed tunes together, and of course share with everyone what you've been working on.

Although this group is geared at musicians, I hope to welcome all serious jazz fans out there who just like to listen and learn how these things work. Bring recordings, lead sheets (even your own!), stands/chairs, and equipment.
