GO PATS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a potluck food item and beverage to Joanna's house at 3:00. We will walk for about 2 hours. Route will depend on road and path conditions, and weather, but we will be walking around Wellesley. We should be back around 5:30ish and will put out the food and beverage spread. By kick-off at 6:30, we should be ready to relax in front of the TV.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will email my address to all confirmed &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs. In your RSVP. let us know if there is something particular that you would like to bring for the potluck. Otherwise, I may ask you specifically to bring an entree, appetizer, salad or desert. BYOB. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy rain or snow will cancel walk, but not party! If you want to party, but not walk, come at 5:30.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joanna</member_name><member_id>4442725</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203264529000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Who doesn't love a good football game?</why><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201450833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Superbowl Sunday walk, potluck and party!</name><id>7206039</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202068800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7206039/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/c/global_3073932.jpeg</photo_url></item>
