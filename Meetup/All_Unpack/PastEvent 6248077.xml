We will be having our Sunday service in our new location at 200 Amory St in Jamaica Plain, 1 block from the stony brook T stop (orange line).   The service starts at 9:30 with a half hour silent meditation and then is followed by a service with communion. All are welcome.  We are so happy and grateful to God for this new home and hope you come and join us in filling it with light and love.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service is followed by a friendly brunch and then an Introduction to Christian Mysticism Class that is open to all.  Class starts at 12:45pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there,   &lt;br /&gt;Blessings,   &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542028000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188176822000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chritian Mystic Sunday Service</name><id>6248077</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188739800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/6248077/</event_url></item>
