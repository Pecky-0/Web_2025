Donations accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is the 19th year that Dr. Bezmen has been doing these monthly healings for the public.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>William and Judith will be there to greet you.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235092928000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Holistic health &amp; Spiritualist</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Pathways-to-Health</urlname><id>1369837</id><group_lat>40.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-73.0100021362</group_lon><name>Pathways To Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233203320000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An-Ra Energy Healing Night &amp; Meditation</name><id>9625540</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234571400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Pathways-to-Health/events/9625540/</event_url></item>
