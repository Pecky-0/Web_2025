<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will discuss Niccolo Machiavelli's philosophy or rather political theory on the next two meetings. We will focus on the Discourses on Livy. For this upcoming meeting the suggested reading is the 1st of the 3 books of this work. (The 2nd and 3rd books are planned for the meeting after that.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice introduction to Machiavelli in the Stanford Ecyclopedia on the web (&lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/contents-unabridged.html)" target="_blank"&gt;http://plato.stanford...&lt;/a&gt;. Discourses on Livy is available in Harvey C. Mansfield’s &amp;amp; Nathan Tarcov’s translation with a nice introduction (University of Chicago Press,1996 ISBN: 0-226-50036-5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike, thank you very much for your helpful suggestion for those who have time to read only parts of the first Book of the Discourses for the next meeting. &lt;br /&gt;Here are Mike's suggestions to read:&lt;br /&gt;Preface: all&lt;br /&gt;1: 1 and 4 until mention of the Egyptians and the 1st sentence of 6.&lt;br /&gt;2: 1 through 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;all of chapters 3 and 4&lt;br /&gt;5: 1 through 3 and 4 two thirds of the way down starting at &amp;quot;There is much disputed . . .&amp;quot; until the end of the section.&lt;br /&gt;6: 3 and 4&lt;br /&gt;7: 1 until &amp;quot;This can be demonstrated . . .&amp;quot; and 2&lt;br /&gt;8: 2&lt;br /&gt;9: 1 and 2&lt;br /&gt;10: 1 &lt;br /&gt;all of chapters 11 through 18 except skip all of 15&lt;br /&gt;21: 1&lt;br /&gt;24: 1 and 2 until &amp;quot;the history of Horatius . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;all of chapters 25 and 26&lt;br /&gt;27: just the heading&lt;br /&gt;29: 1 and 3 until &amp;quot;It is true that among . . . &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;30: all&lt;br /&gt;38: the heading and 4&lt;br /&gt;46: just the heading&lt;br /&gt;55: 4 and 5&lt;br /&gt;56: the heading and 1st sentence of 1 and end beginning at &amp;quot;The cause of this . . . &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;58: all&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1149770953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Machiavelli: Discourses on Livy 1</name><id>4969999</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150929000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/4969999/</event_url></item>
