During Restaurant Week the best of the best, provide a Prix Fixe Menu and make the unaffordable not only affordable, but a must!!! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Barcelona captures the beautiful simplicity of traditional Spanish food while presenting this food in a modern, trendy way means that the Chef and Staff of Barcelona New Haven have created and contained a culinary miracle. If you are a foodie or a gourmet, this is a great opportunity to taste some of the finest ingredients prepared with passion and artful simplicity. Beautifully furnished, beautiful food, and is prix fixe at $29.00 for a three course meal (appetizer, entree and dessert). One of my favorite dining experiences of all time. Who would have thought this little university town could harbor such a culinary gem... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voted New Haven Advocate’s “Best New Restaurant” and “Best Wine List,” Barcelona is located next to the Omni Hotel in downtown New Haven just steps from Yale University.  A street-level lounge overlooks a dining bar area with a stone fireplace.  The sophisticated glass-and-steel dining room is framed by a 2000-bottle refrigerated wine cellar.  The dramatic 80-seat private room is dominated by a larger than life, wall to wall, 30-foot mural of a Spanish Bullfighter, and a 20-person Chef’s Table, fashioned from a single walnut tree, borders the busy open kitchen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;This is me, a Spaniard, guaranteeing that this is a truly unique, religiously sensual experience.&amp;quot; :Enjoy your life, try this restaurant, and ¡viva España!&amp;quot;-Dan Gamito&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;[/color &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post the menu when it is available! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner we will move from the dining area to the lounge, so if you can't join us for dinner come for drinks!!!  &lt;br /&gt;My cell is 203-974-3170 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barcelonawinebar.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.barcelonaw...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacey</member_name><member_id>7637795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1272474534000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269882461000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Barcelona -Terrific Dining and Truly Unique</name><id>13025659</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272063600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/13025659/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
