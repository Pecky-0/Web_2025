Season starts approximately the 1st or 2nd week in May and lasting about 12 weeks. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;In response to our relatively mediocre team performance last season, we are holding mandatory tryouts dates for everyone who would like to play on this spring's team. (you don't have to attend every tryout date) &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;It is my intention to have a more competitive team this season. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, suggestions or cannot attend but would like to, please contact me. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Doug &lt;br /&gt;Team Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>2956305</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207068071000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206503306000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHC COED SOFTBALL TEAM TRYOUTS/PRACTICE</name><id>7604053</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206894600000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7604053/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
