Kick off July and Independence Day by being on the spot and making some improvised fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week my backyard will be host to the incubator as it's going to be perfect weather outside!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual I'll guide us through a fun, silly, and wacky list of exercises and games!  Bring some friends, smiles, and most importantly relax.   This week maybe bring a jacket too, it might get cooler outside toward the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we'll monkey our way over to central square and grab some grub and even some ice cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's bring the laughs to my awesome backyard!  Just come around back once you get there &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and if you are driving there is usual at least one if not 2+ parking spots available. Just pull around back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. palm tree, swingset, and that particular backyard not mine and not included in this meetup, haha.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278618880000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277819412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Forever After Improv'D </name><id>13947076</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278027000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/13947076/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/b/global_16082027.jpeg</photo_url></item>
