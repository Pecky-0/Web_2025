There are more than 17 miles of shady trails and wooded roads to explore but of course we won't do all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids will especially enjoy the popular Caryl Trail, a 0.5-mi. walk to an old mill site. Or, for a more strenuous trek, we can ascend Noanet Peak for views of Boston. If we are lucky we may see hawks migrating overhead. The four ponds are home to bluegills, painted turtles, and bullfrogs. There are wildflowers, flowering wintergreen, and marsh marigold, abound in the woods and marsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the centuries, this almost-600-acre landscape has seen many uses â€“ as preserved space, an early industrial site, and Native American hunting ground. In 1923, Amelia Peabody purchased a nearby farm and over the next six decades acquired hundreds of acres. Miss Peabody regularly encouraged the public to enjoy her property, and became a beloved figure in the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Points North: I-95/Rt. 128 South, take Exit 17, Rt. 135 West.
