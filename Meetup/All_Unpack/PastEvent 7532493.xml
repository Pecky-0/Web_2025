In addition to the usual casual chatting throughout, they suggest we discuss the topic of how to draw new members to secular organizations. At the end of the brunch they'll have a brief discussion of what everybody has come up with and see where that leads us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235658853000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205506621000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humanist Equinox Brunch</name><id>7532493</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206894600000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/7532493/</event_url></item>
