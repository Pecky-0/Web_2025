The Center needs help packing backpacks with school supplies for their &amp;quot;Back to School&amp;quot; party. Pizza will be provided.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center is located on Dwight St in a great antique house (there's even servant's quarters in the basement!). They have a full parking lot in the back, so parking isn't a&lt;br /&gt;problem.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backpacks that are stuffed at the Pizza Party will be handed out to the kids on Thursday, August 23rd at the 'Back to School' Party. If you have a free hour or two on that day and would like to participate, &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/calendar/5676375/"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to the centers website for more information on the&lt;br /&gt;organization: &lt;a href="http://www.ccccnh.org/"&gt;http://www.ccccnh.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: &lt;br /&gt;Devorah at (203) 314-4329&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187472890000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186668006000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pizza! and Pencil Sharpeners!</name><id>6151436</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187299800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6151436/</event_url></item>
