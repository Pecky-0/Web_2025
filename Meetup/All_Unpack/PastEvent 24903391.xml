He will be reading from and signing copies of his new novel, Ghost Story - which is # 13 in the Dresden Files series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His appearance is at the Harvard Coop Barnes and Noble in Cambridge, MA on August 3rd from 7:00-8:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at the Coop entrance before the signing, then at 6:30, we'll head inside to try to get seats. If you arrive later than 6:30, just come on in (the signing is listed as being on Level 3). Afterwards, if there is interest in food, we might grab a bite to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
