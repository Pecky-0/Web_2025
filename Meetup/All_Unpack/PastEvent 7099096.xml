Now find one that is also a great work of fiction. Finally, find one that's beautifully written but doesn't offer much by way of groundbreaking ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: The Literature of Ideas&lt;br /&gt;Science Fiction is often referred to as a literature of ideas. Sometimes we are accused of using this as an excuse for clothing wonderful ideas in poorly written stories. Back in the 60s and 70s, the New Wave movement was in part a call to raise the literary quality of science fiction, which some think went too far in emphasizing writing over ideas. Since then...well, what do you think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell us about the books or stories you found in this month's challenge.&lt;br /&gt;Where is the pendulum today between great writing and great ideas?&lt;br /&gt;Does a cool idea alone justify a story? Does fine writing?&lt;br /&gt;What cool ideas are you trying to put into your stories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;Open Discussions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202850768000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200175371000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers February Meetup</name><id>7099096</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202677200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/7099096/</event_url></item>
