We are going to have food, wine, italian music and more. I ask if you could please be so kind to make or take something ( ITALIAN OF COURSE) to help out. John has been gracious enough to open his house for this wonderful Meetup. I hope all can come to this exciting Meetup. Please RSVP Yes if you mean YES. I will need to give John an accurate count on who is coming for this evening. So please RSVP YES if you are 100%. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciao,&lt;br /&gt;John Amato&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Amato</member_name><member_id>3621990</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255827695000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Italian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-420</urlname><id>447590</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Italian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252372134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>UNA FESTA ITALIANA A CASA DI JOHN DEL NEGRO</name><id>11313977</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255201200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-420/events/11313977/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/4/global_2557124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
