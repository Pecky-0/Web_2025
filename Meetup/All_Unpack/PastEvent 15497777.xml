We have some very exciting announcements before our 1 and only speaker: &lt;b&gt;Jeremy Clarke Â· &lt;a href="http://jeremyclarke.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Simian Uprising&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Widgetize everything: building smarter themes with widgets and sidebars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt; We all know the value of using widgets to customize &amp;quot;the sidebar&amp;quot; of Wordpress themes, but the underlying system is rarely used to its full potential. By creating many specialized and contextual sidebars any part of a theme can quickly be made customizable and extensible. This talk will cover all aspects of widgetizing themes, including how to register sidebars, problems to watch out for and tons of ideas for how to make the most of them. Theming and PHP/HTML knowledge definitely a plus, but not necessarily required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bio:&lt;/b&gt; Jeremy Clarke is a PHP, HTML, CSS and WordPress hacker from Montreal. He loves his job working on the nonprofit citizen media site Global Voices, where he manages dozens of WordPress sites, blogs, plugins, themes and a couple of bitchy Linux servers. He has a communications degree from Concordia University, but is mostly a self-taught web developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agenda:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;7-7:30pm - Networking, Pizza &lt;br /&gt;7:30-7:45pm - Opening remarks, updates, any other business &lt;br /&gt;7:50-8:50pm - Session (Sampson/Paul) &lt;br /&gt;8:50-9pm - Wrap-up&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>James Coletti</member_name><member_id>7809368</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kurt Eng</member_name><member_id>9694496</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297792745000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>WordPress fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-wordpress-meetup</urlname><id>1340213</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston WordPress</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>91</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290147669000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BWPM Nov 2010: Widgetize everything!</name><id>15497777</id><headcount>60</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291075200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-wordpress-meetup/events/15497777/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/a/global_17306138.jpeg</photo_url></item>
