I love to share my love of paper crafting with others. I have a very well stocked craft room with everything for card making and scrapbooking. Anyone interested in papercrafting is welcome to join us. I offer a variety of classes focusing on rubber stamping and scrapbooking techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Wednesday - 10am to ?? during the day for people that would like to get together and share ideas or learn new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evening Groups - open stamp and scrap night on the second Friday of each month from 6pm to midnight and two technique classes each month. Bring your current projects and join the fun! Don't have a project, I have hundreds of card and scrapbook ideas to help you get started!&lt;/p&gt;
