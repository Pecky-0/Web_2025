<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I will be DMing my first RPGA game and my first game at all in many many years. It is aimed at low level / newer players, power gamers would probably be bored but it will be slower paced then normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John McGlaughlin, John Moquin and Jason have confirmed, leaving one spot open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to post any questions or what characters you will be using on the adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, help me out by knowing your characters abilities. Know any spells you take, how they work and such. Don't count on me to have memorized the DMs Guide :) That'll help the game move faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Matthew&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542411000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192726650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RPGA in North Kingston!</name><id>6574019</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192896000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/6574019/</event_url></item>
