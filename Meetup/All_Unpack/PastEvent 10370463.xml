There are two parking lots and you can use either to start your ascent of the cliffs. (Lat:44.14753 Lon:-71.37014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice, lightly moderate hike to see beautiful Arethusa Falls, the highest waterfall in the state! Plus several smaller falls along the way. All this in under 1.5 miles! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/d/b/600_8485563.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll then continue on the Arethusa-Ripley Falls Trail to the summit of Frankenstein Cliff where we might see Peregrine Falcons. There are 3 view points of most of the surrounding mountains from this cliff. This loop hike is 4.7 miles, 1600' of elevation gain, with tons of photo opportunities and views. We will hike at a leisurely pace so it'll take 4-5 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested after wards we can all stop at one of the local restaurant/pubs for a little social hour after wards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring bug spray, sunscreen, water (2 liters) and lunch/snack. Depending on the weather you may also want to bring a wind/rain layer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start hiking at 10 am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;NEHAAG disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hiker profile is complete so we can verify that your qualified to join us on this White Mountain hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling is always advised and a great way to get to know your fellow members.&lt;br /&gt;[a href=&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/r/inbound/0/0/shareimg/http://www.meetup.com/The-New-England-Hiking-Meetup/?a=shareimg&amp;quot;"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;][img border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;The New England Hiking &amp;amp; Adventurer&amp;#039;s Group&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://img.meetup.com/img/logo/med/h/hiking.png&amp;quot;"&gt;http://img.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;][/a]&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Trailhead: Route 302 in Crawford Notch a few miles west of the Sawyer Rock Picni</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243086123000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241817945000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arethusa Falls and Frankenstein Cliffs</name><id>10370463</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242567900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/10370463/</event_url></item>
