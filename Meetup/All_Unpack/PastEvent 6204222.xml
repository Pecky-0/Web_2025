<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Cindy Clark will be joining us to present the concept of Healing Dolls.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was inspired to create a healing or medicine doll for her unborn grandson when ultrasound tests revealed birth defects.  Cindy made the doll as a tangible symbol of prayer and focus of positive energy, utilizing a variety of healing elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy will lead the group in a guided meditation. A creative spirit doll may emerge representing desired intentions or specific changes which would contribute to one?s personal soul journey.  For some the special doll visualized may be symbolic of the inner child.  Others may focus on physical, emotional or spiritual healing of themselves or a loved one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program will include discussion and demonstration of the healing attributes of colors, herbs, gems, minerals, crystals, sacred symbols and animal totems in the doll making process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for great food and conversation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many come to the potlucks other than Meetup members, so do not look at the RSVP's to determine if it will be a well attended event!  We do hope you will come and join other like-minded folks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190071096000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187478265000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Indigo Children and Parents September Meetup</name><id>6204222</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189893600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/6204222/</event_url></item>
