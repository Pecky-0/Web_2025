You then bid on other people's fabulous yarn that you are now in love with, and buy some fabulous fibers.  All proceeds of the sale will benefit Lora's family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:  Saturday. July 17th from 10:00 a.m.  until 2:00 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:  The Club House of Greenview Village, 55 Golfview Drive, Manchester, New Hampshire, 03102.  Email me if you need directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact:  Denise Daniel at (603) 674-3758 or denisedaniel@comcast.net &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP:  The complex limits us to 20 people, so please RSVP with your email address,  just in case I have to plan for an alternate venue, if there are too many of us planning to attend.  If you cannot attend, but would like to help,  either by donating yarn or money, please let me know and we can make arrangements.  Also, we will have to be relatively well behaved as other residents will be able to use the clubhouse as they wish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking:  There is street parking available only.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food:  Please bring finger foods if you wish, this is a pot luck event, but the complex does not allow alcohol.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other questions, please let me know.   Thanks in advance for any help and support for Lora :) &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>1774915</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279453503000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-486</urlname><id>179362</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Concord Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277674143000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yarn Auction Benefit for Lora Kinberger</name><id>13928097</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279375200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-486/events/13928097/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/f/7/global_11771879.jpeg</photo_url></item>
