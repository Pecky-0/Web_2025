&lt;p&gt;"...What would we do without charts? They're one of the most fundamental parts of flying-but they can also be challenging to interpret, difficult to read, and sometimes head-scratchingly confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new live seminar is meant to help you master them. Based on our popular "Chart Challenge" series of online courses, it's a refresher clinic where you, the audience member, get to put your knowledge to the test. We'll quiz you on everything from VFR sectionals to instrument approach plates, and dig into the practical issues that come with them. We'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenging questions about specific VFR and IFR charts &lt;br /&gt;

Critical tie-ins with real-world procedures and decision making &lt;br /&gt;

Analysis of tragic accidents caused by chart misinterpretation &lt;br /&gt;

Important "gotchas" you need to be on the lookout for..."&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365508769000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363799177000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chart Challenge AOPA Seminar</name><id>110192072</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365462000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/110192072/</event_url></item>
