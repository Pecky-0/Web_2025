For those of you who haven't been before, Montreal knows how to throw a party! A large part of downtown is closed off and several outdoor stages erected for the free concerts.  Make your reservations now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us will stay once again at the Hotel Viger, where rooms start at $68. They have a 48 hour cancelation policy so you can reserve in advance without worrying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with past trips to Montreal and Quebec, there is an itinerary of events for the weekend. You can join the group for every event or skip some events and wander off on your own for a while. Everyone is responsible for their own transportation and accomodation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fri 3rd&lt;br /&gt;2:00 visit the Botanical Gardens and Olympic Stadium (meet at 1:00 at the Hotel Viger, 1001 rue Saint-Hubert)&lt;br /&gt;7:00 supper in Old Montreal at L'Aventure, 438 Place Jacques Cartier&lt;br /&gt;9:00 take in several free outdoor shows beginning with Florence K - La Nocha de Lola playing at the &amp;quot;scene General Motors&amp;quot; on rue Jeanne Mance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sat 4th&lt;br /&gt;9:00 light breakfast in Old Montreal at Cafe Van Houtte, 165 rue St Paul ouest&lt;br /&gt;10-1 sightseeing in old Montreal&lt;br /&gt;1:00 lunch at the Pub St Paul, 124 rue St Paul Est&lt;br /&gt;2-5 Jet-boating ride through the rapids, 47 de la Commune west, $65 thrill ride my Montreal friends recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 The Lost Fingers concert at Club Metropolis, $30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-11 take in several free outdoor shows beginning with Cordero, at the &amp;quot;scene du festival&amp;quot; on Ste.
