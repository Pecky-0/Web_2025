We have decided to merge some of our trips together to give members of both meetups the best of both worlds!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetup is geared more towards mountaineering and backpacking and Boston Rock and ice is more rock and ice climbing! Well, now our members get the best of both worlds!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The calenders are going to be put together so all the members will always have a rope to tie into and there will be always something to do!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first Merged trip. I apologize for the last minute nature. So grab your rope and tent and come climb this weekend!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending upon interest we will leave friday afternoon.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reserved a camp ground at Baker river camp ground    &lt;br /&gt;Friday night and Saturday night. The cost is 10$ per person per night   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site should be large enough to acomadate us and if more sites are needed we can deal with that later.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sites have running water, electric, toilet and shower. Pet freindly with proof of rabies shot and on leash.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday morning we will hit the walls and enjoy an awesome day.
