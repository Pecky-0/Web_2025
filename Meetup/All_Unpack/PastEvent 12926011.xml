Also folks should really bring a tripod and prime's if they have them. Since it is a nighttime shoot, also warm clothing would be a highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on going Please message Cody- if you are not going to show or are late just call Cody and let him know! :)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Cody&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cody Bertrand</member_name><member_id>9614128</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269215916000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268944323000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence Water Fire- Friday night!</name><id>12926011</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269042300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/12926011/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/6/global_13739510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
