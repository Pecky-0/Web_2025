It is several hundred yards up Route 302 towards Bretton Woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the Zealand Falls road being closed we will hike the approximately one mile up the Zealand Falls Road to the Sugarloaf Trail from there the Sugarloaf Trail is easy, with some moderate uphill grades. The trail begins at 1644 feet. At 0.2 mile the trail leaves the river at an easy uphill grade and immediately crosses the Bethlehem water line. The easy grade changes to a more moderate uphill grade at 0.7 mile until it reaches the saddle between the two summits. A sign at 0.9 mile marks the intersection between the two Sugarloaves: Middle Sugarloaf to the left (south) and North Sugarloaf to the right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle Sugarloaf Trail (0.4 mile) continues on an easy to moderate grade before becoming very steep in the last ledgy section to the fully exposed summit at 2526 feet. It offers a 360 degree view of various mountain ranges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;North Sugarloaf Spur (0.3 mile) continues at an easy grade, then loses elevation slightly and swings to the mountain's back side. The trail climbs gradually, ending abruptly on the open ledge of North Sugarloaf summit at 2360 feet. The view to the east is of Mt. Washington and the Presidential Range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total distance covered will be approximately 5.6 miles and should take approximately 5.5 hours including breaks.  Once we get back down and the group wants to, we can hike the short round trip trestle trail (approximate distance 1.5 miles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some type of foot traction (e.g. yak-trax, micro-spikes, crampons) is required for this hike.  Please be prepared for winter conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that all maybes will be changed to no's on December 29th to make room available for anybody on the waiting list.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in a black four door Toyota Echo with Maine license plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231180114000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228156160000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MIDDLE AND NORTH SUGARLOAF</name><id>9258133</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230991200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9258133/</event_url></item>
