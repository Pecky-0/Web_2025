&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different bar scenes in New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/2/2012's location is: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Prime 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime 16 is located on Temple Street and has one of the best selections of Draft and Bottled Beers in downtown. (Was clear cut THE best before Cask Republic arrived.)&amp;nbsp; For food a wide selection of Great Burgers is accompanied by some of the best Truffle Fries and Sweet Potato Fries in New Haven.&amp;nbsp; (In both cases: Arguably THE best with a few other locations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Special Specials this time around, just their normal Monday that &lt;em&gt;in the past has been&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;

1/2 price Premium Drafts until 7PM and $3 Sea Hag IPA cans from 7 till close. &lt;br /&gt;

I will let you know if/when I know they are any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come break your New Years Resolution Early!&amp;nbsp; (Unless it's to Drink More, in which case get started on it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP.&amp;nbsp; For Happy Hour type events if you're only a &lt;em&gt;MAYBE&lt;/em&gt; put this in the text section of your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your contact is ME... (A.K.A "A.J.") Cell phone is 315-345-9348, you can call or text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;

Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;

Ever. &lt;br /&gt;
