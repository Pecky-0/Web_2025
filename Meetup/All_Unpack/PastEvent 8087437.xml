The Landing is Boston's only completely outdoor waterfront bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Landing offers bowl drinks and specialty frozen drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their website for more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelandingboston.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thelanding...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll wear a &lt;b&gt;GREEN&lt;/b&gt; shirt.  I'm asking &lt;b&gt;everyone to wear something&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;GREEN&lt;/b&gt;, so that it'll be easy to find the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no group tab.  Please maintain your own tab or pay as you go.  People will be arriving and leaving at different times, so a group tab does not work out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll get there around 5:15pm and I'll stay for a couple of hours; however feel free to come and go as you please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This date, June 25th, would have been my 20th wedding anniversary.  So, I'll drink to that!  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAIN CANCELS!  This bar is all outdoors.  I'll reschedule if the weather is questionable.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, The Landing does not serve food; however, they will let you bring in take-out food from nearby restaurants to eat at their bar and tables. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya there!  Wear &lt;b&gt;GREEN&lt;/b&gt;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear a GREEN shirt.
