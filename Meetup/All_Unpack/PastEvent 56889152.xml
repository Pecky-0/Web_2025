Here is the description: After their parents divorce in the 1970's, Andre Dubus III and his three siblings grew up with their exhausted working mother in a depressed Massachusetts mill town saturated with drugs and crime. To protect himself and those he loved from street violence, Andre learned to use his fists so well that he was even scared of himself. He was on a fast track to getting killed, or killing someone else, or to beatings-for-pay as a boxer. Nearby, his father, an eminent author, taught on a college campus and took the kids out on Sundays. The clash of worlds couldn't have been more stark or more difficult for a son to communicate to a father. Only by becoming a writer himself could Andre begin to bridge the abyss and save himself. Hope to see you in April!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary </member_name><member_id>13108187</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335129428000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332118775000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Book Club Meetup</name><id>56889152</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335124800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/56889152/</event_url></item>
