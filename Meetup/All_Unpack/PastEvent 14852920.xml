The entrance to the boat ramp is at the traffic light at the intersection of Rt. 20 and Edgemere Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminder - PFDs are required by law to be worn this time of year (and by the group all year anyway!).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286043497000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285119204000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle at Flint Pond/Lake Quinsig, Shrewsbury</name><id>14852920</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285506000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/14852920/</event_url></item>
