<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Since we have Bun Lai of Miya's giving us a treat and talk in July I think we should follow up with a monthly dinner reflecting his message and what we have learned regarding sustainability in our food sources and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of fun and lots of food and drink. RSVPs open 30 days prior to the event and these dinners fill up quickly. Remember there are no rules. Caryl will email the address to those attending the Wednesday before the dinner. Be sure to RSVP early as we always fill up quickly. Do RSVP though, especially if it gets you on the waiting list. Usually the waiting list people get to join us for dinner. Plan to cook on site, unless your recipe takes 45 minutes or more to prepare start to finish. Because the oven opens and closes often baked goods (excepting cookies) are best done ahead of time. Remember this isn’t just a potluck; this is about sharing the pleasure of cooking and food, and learning from one another while drinking wine 'n stuff and having great conversations. Bring what you'd like to drink plus a little to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send the address a few days before the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344775796000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339077572000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sustainable Planet</name><id>qxhmlcyqlbnb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344639600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/68151342/</event_url></item>
