RSVP asap, as we will be making a reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/20--I've made a reservation under my name (Norah Piehl) and will try to get there at least a little early. They've promised us one of the big booths in the back, so look for me there--I look more or less like my photo, but if you don't recognize me, just start approaching various tall brunettes and see where the night takes you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your ideas, questions, and thoughts about projects you're working on or those you'd like to try! I'll have some discussion questions to use if conversation lags, but I'm hoping we can just use attendees' interests to guide the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Norah</member_name><member_id>11201436</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293455041000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291228048000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Writer's Meetup Networking Night</name><id>15609919</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292976000000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/15609919/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
