<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The time is here for our Spring EAA Young Eagles Rally. &lt;br /&gt;Much help will be needed again. Contact our Chairman Ed Murphy at ceesna66@aol.com or just respond here. Murph has the info on the $1.00 discount from Phillips 66. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set up will be about 8:00 a.m.  We'll need tables, tent, chairs and lots of planes and maybe even a helicopter if Steve B. is so gracious again... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far we've have done these twice. Flown over 100 kids and some adults as well each event. We should have plenty poof local press for this as the notices have gone out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, we'll have a BBQ after we're done like last time.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all on the 16th of May. &lt;br /&gt;Charley and Ed&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242858628000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240874477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FPA Young Eagles Rally at KFIT</name><id>10280608</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242475200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/10280608/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
