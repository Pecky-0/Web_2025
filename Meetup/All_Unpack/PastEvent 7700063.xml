I had to change the venue from Johnny Ds to Jake's because I had forgotten that I already promised some folks I would be at Jake's.  I'm sorry if this messes up anyone's plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll have my cell phone on.  Call me if you can't find me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the following website for more info, directions, etc:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jakes-bbq.com/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jakes-bbq....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake's is terrible with updating their website, so the music is not listed.  However, according to the Boston Blues website, Lisa Marie is playing.  Check out that website:  &lt;a href="http://www.bostonblues.com/cal.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonblue...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people from the other Meetup groups are planning to get a bite to eat at Watch City Tavern before going to Jake's.  I can't make it to Watch City; however, feel free to join those folks from other Meetup groups.  From the looks of things, no reservations will be made for Watch City or Jake's.  Way too many people have responded with the 5 groups going that night to make a reservations, so I think they plan on just arriving and everyone will sit at separate tables with smaller groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My cell phone # is 617-999-9094.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210641085000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>To have fun</why><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207678627000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live Music @ Jake's Dixie Roadhouse</name><id>7700063</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210467600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/7700063/</event_url></item>
