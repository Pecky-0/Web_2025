We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time.Hike ratings:easy,moderate,strenuous,very strenuous. There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group). The hiking Meetup group,(Fellowship of the Tortoise) does easier,slower paced hikes than this group. Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals. This is a dog free hiking group.We start as a group,hike as a group,and finish as a group.Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker.This trip is not for you if you are faster than the group and do not want to stay with us,or if you want to head off on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
