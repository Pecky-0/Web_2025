Feel like socializing?  Do you like to listen to live music?  Then come out to Lowell with us for a night of fun, dancing and listening to the great sounds of The River City Band!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The River City Band is a local band that plays classic rock and pop.  Some of you might have seen them at Palmers in Andover, The Claddaugh in Lawrence, or at other venues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been invited by a friend to his private party for a night of dancing and socializing.  The River City Band will be playing from 8:15 pm - Midnight.  This is an annual event that our friend organizes for close friends and family.  Because this is a private event, we have to limit the amount of people and also prepay for our tickets.  If you're interested, please contact Janet by e-mail via this site to set up payment arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The schedule for the night is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocktail Hour 7:15 pm&lt;br /&gt;Music 8:15 pm - Midnight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  $15.00 per person in advance; there will be no tickets at the door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline:  Unfortunately, we can only give one week notice and need payment by Friday, November 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the request of this friend, we will not be able to display our Meetup sign.  Please meet us at the front door NO LATER than 7:15 pm.  We will be there at 7 pm.  If you're running late or are lost, a contact number will be available a day prior to all those who will be attending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So throw those dancing shoes on and get ready to boogie.  Hope to see you at the party.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the front door no later than 7:15pm</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258416524000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257015597000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The River City Band in Lowell</name><id>11756802</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258243200000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/11756802/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/b/e/global_11537054.jpeg</photo_url></item>
