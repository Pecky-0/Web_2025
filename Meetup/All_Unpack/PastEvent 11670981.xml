We will draw out the name of anyone just starting a “New Business” (under one year), the winner can advertise her business, and receive mentoring support from the group for a particular challenge or issue. *Very Popular!&lt;br /&gt;Speaker: Kari Henley –&lt;br /&gt;Topic:  How Come Men are Happier than Women?&lt;br /&gt;Join us as Kari shares some of her newest research into women’s issues, and unveils a new landmark study showing that in the last 40 years, women are significantly less happy - both categorically, and as they grow older. Men, on the other hand, are much happier than they were 40 years ago, and increase in their happiness as they age. What’s going on here, and how does this apply to our lives at home and at work?&lt;br /&gt;Bio: Kari Henley has been organizing AWBL for the past two years, following the founder, Joan Fisler. In addition, she is the President of the Board of Directors for the Women &amp;amp; Family Life Center, writes a weekly column for the Huffington Post, and is completing her Masters degree in Organizational Leadership. She is currently writing a book about the power of women gathering, and the importance of building community.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>WE meet in the carriage house at the end of the driveway</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cheryl Roby</member_name><member_id>10682494</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256906003000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Association-of-Women-Business-leaders</urlname><id>1543671</id><group_lat>41.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>AWBL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256064557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October 28 Meeting</name><id>11670981</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256733000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Association-of-Women-Business-leaders/events/11670981/</event_url></item>
