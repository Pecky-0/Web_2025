We also avoid situations that could cause these emotions to come out. The funny thing is, the more we try to avoid them, the more life provides us with situations that test our resilience. What if we could face them instead? What if we could listen to our fear, anger, sadness and hear what it has to tell us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will focus on exercises that will help you achieve a greater emotional awareness as well as emotion regulation. We will focus on breathing exercises that can be especially helpful when dealing with anxiety, anger and depression. Please wear loose, comfortable clothing and dress in layers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>http://www.artsoulyoga.com/Art_%26_Soul/Directions.html</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emilia</member_name><member_id>1728643</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329757197000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>whole-living-center</urlname><id>1384267</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Whole Living</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326990958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Working With Difficult Emotions</name><id>48760322</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329696000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/whole-living-center/events/48760322/</event_url></item>
