Usually you have to be Yale affiliated (or with Yalie friends) to come here, but they're opening their doors (even two hours early, in fact) just for the NHC. Just tell the people at the door you're with the Collective.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now as I just said, they're normally not open until 8pm, but I promised them a good crowd if they opened at 6pm just for us.  Don't prove me wrong! (No, really... please don't!)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$3 Wells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2 PBRs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2 Miller Drafts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 Martinis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chips and Pretzels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two free Pool Tables&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GPSCY is literally located in the middle of a block - the block surrounded by Chapel, Park, York, and Elm Streets. It's close to Broadway and Downtown.  I'll post signs where you should turn on York or Park.  Feel free to call my cell: 203-314-4329. It's like a minute walk from the Yale Reperatory Theatre (walk north on York St) so I could always lead you from there if you're confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More detailed info: coming from 217 Park, follow pathway past Yale Cabaret, (slightly set back from the street on a paved pathway), past the Afro Culture building. Keep walking, and after you go through an archway, there is a gothic-looking wooden door directly to your right. You've arrived! The official address is 204 York St. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from York, walk up (north) from Chapel (the Yale Rep theatre is at Chapel and York. It will be at your back as you walk up York). Turn onto the first driveway on your left that is not blocked by construction. Follow that driveway until the door at the left before the archway. This is GPSCY! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds more complicated than it is, trust me. If you have trouble just call me or flag down a Yalie and ask where GPSCY (pronounced Gypsy) and/or Gryphon's Pub is. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your contact is Devorah 203-314-4329&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(IDs a must; you will be carded)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;GPSCY is Cash-Only, as are most of New Haven's finest establishments. There is an on-site ATM and Bank of America isn't too far away. Remember, they're opening early just for us, so let's fill the pub up!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207778746000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206564613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Happy Hour!
