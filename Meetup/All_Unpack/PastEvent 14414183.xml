The price is $20 for members and $25 for non-members if you purchase in advance; plan to pay about $10 more at the door if tickets are available.  I will get there early and wait in line; please join me so we can get good seats as soon as the doors open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alloy Orchestra accompany the fully restored version of Metropolis, the Fritz Lang classic dystopian epic. &lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five additional minutes of footage, once thought forever lost, were discovered in Buenos Aires in 2008.  Now newly restored, Metropolis is being screened in its complete form for the first time since its 1927 premiere in Berlin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger Ebert calls the Alloy Orchestra &amp;quot;the best in the world at accompanying silent films.&amp;quot; The three-man ensemble work with an outrageous assemblage of peculiar objects. They thrash and grind soulful music from unlikely sources.  If you click the link above to the RAW website, they have a link to the Alloy site where you can watch them developing the score.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288745860000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281723413000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Metropolis" with live orchestra @ Real Art Ways</name><id>14414183</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288481400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/14414183/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
