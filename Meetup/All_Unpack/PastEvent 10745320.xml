Some of you had mentioned the Half Moon Coffee &amp;amp; Grille Cafe' in Wallingford, CT.  That's closer to southern CT, right! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a little description of this gem in Wallingford:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The vibrantly decorated Half Moon Coffee and Grille Cafe is the perfect spot to gab with friends over coffee or enjoy a nice meal with the family. Taking advantage of it's location in the center of Wallingford, the cafe's open windows provide a nice view of the quaint little town and its shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you you've never been to one of our meetups, it's very relaxed. You don't have to be fluent in Italian to join us, just a willinginess to immerse yourself into the Italian experience. The level of italian spoken at these meetups are student to teacher level. We mix it up too.  Please don't feel itimidated at all. Just enjoy a cup of tea or coffee, maybe a bite to eat if your hungry and sit and take it all in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark your calendars now and plan to join us on Wednesday, July 15th at 7:00pm.&lt;br /&gt;Click on the link below for directions - It's easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?li=d&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;f=d&amp;amp;iwstate1=dir:to&amp;amp;daddr=50+N+Main+St,+Wallingford,+CT+06492-3732+(Half+Moon+Coffee+and+Grille+Cafe)&amp;amp;geocode=CaTP1QZVDXGiFVSMeAId0uKo-w&amp;amp;iwloc=1&amp;amp;dq=half+moon+coffee+%26+grille+cafe&amp;amp;cid=4883446328663754679&amp;amp;ei=WZRFSpesFJ-sM8yJrdUJ" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ci Vediamo &lt;br /&gt;Lorenzo&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorenzo</member_name><member_id>4408109</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1248301773000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Amici Italiani</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-452</urlname><id>535327</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246073112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Serata di Caffe e Conversazione - Wallingford, CT</name><id>10745320</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247698800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-452/events/10745320/</event_url></item>
