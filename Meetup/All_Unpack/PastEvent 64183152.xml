&lt;p&gt;“There is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving” - Henry Drummond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truer words may never have been spoken, and we invite you to create your own happiness by joining us in service at the next Community Meals, hosted at the UU Church of Haverhill. We expect between 40-45 people, men, woman and children, who have fallen on hard times and look to this program for a good hot meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be expected to show up at the Church at 2:PM, help with preparation, serving and cleanup. With that many people attending we really could use all the help we can get, and it’s a nice way to get to meet each other outside of a circle or ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please consider this act of service and RSVP if you are able.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura McIsaac</member_name><member_id>28273292</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340033717000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336617177000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Meals Service</name><id>64183152</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339869600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/64183152/</event_url></item>
