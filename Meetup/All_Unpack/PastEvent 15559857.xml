Roots and Wings Healing Arts Center and Ann are co-sponsoring this event for all who wish to participate. &lt;i&gt;We're sharing this opportunity and experience with you, as it is always an easy way to align and to feel gooooood; and this is how you allow all that you desire to come to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We invite you to come and immerse yourself in the space of spirit with peace, love and feeling good. Come to relax and align with who you really are and to open yourself to the joy in all that you are. This is always a most wonderful evening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening will consist of 2-3 guided meditations. All you'll have to do is listen to Ann’s voice as she guides you through the meditations, each one usually about 15 - 20 minutes long, with discussions in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;The selection this evening will be focused on getting into feeling good states.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We'll be doing one meditation on feeling gratitude and abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A very powerful meditation on changing your inner &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; (inner narrative) from inside the Vortex of Love (connected to Spirit/Source)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;And one called, &amp;quot;Floating and feeling good&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ***If you like, you can bring a mat, blanket, and pillow to fully relax lying down. Or you can use  what's available there, too, of course. Please arrive a little early to get settled (around 7:05).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome. The class is appropriate whether you are a beginner to meditating, or experienced. Please invite others to sign up and join you! Forward this to your friends, family and groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We have been filled to capacity, so either RSVP'ing thru this site, or registration is required. Non- meetup guests should register by sending name, e-mail, and phone number to: annide@newpossibilitiescoaching.com. They’ll receive confirmation of their registration and a reminder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;“I really did enjoy your guided meditations tonight.  I arrived here feeling so exhausted and found during the experiences tonight an opening and energy re awakening inside.  It was very healing for me to have this experience, and there were many tools I will leave here with.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be on the first floor, in the Wings studio.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292258254000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290786399000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE Evening of Guided Meditations for the Community </name><id>15559857</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292112900000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/15559857/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/4/global_5412564.jpeg</photo_url></item>
