<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Vaclav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic and current President of the European Union&lt;/b&gt;, will keynote a session of the second International Conference on Climate Change March 8-10 in New York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His recent book, &lt;u&gt;Blue Planet in Green Shackles&lt;/u&gt;, argues that the debate over global warming has &amp;quot;become a symbol and example of the clash between truth and propaganda.&amp;quot; Klaus has criticized the UN &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" target="_blank"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; as a group of one-sided, politicized scientists. His sentiment is punctuated with analogies between environmentalism and communism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many interesting quotes from both sides of the climate debate are included. President Klaus provides ample evidence for his assertion that &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;it is freedom, not the climate, that is endangered&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are in for some &lt;i&gt;HEATED&lt;/i&gt; discussion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/span&gt;  We will also be watching the film GLOBAL WARMING OR GLOBAL GOVERNANCE.&lt;/b&gt;  The Global Warming topic is a really important topic that many people have preconceived notions about.  I want folks to understand that this meetUP is NOT about Left v. Right or being ignorant v. full of statistics.  It is about WHO BENEFITS from the proposed Global Warming policy changes.   You may be surprised to learn the answers - even if you think you have already made up your mind on this issue.
