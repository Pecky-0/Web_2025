The West Peak ridge covers a large section of trail I have not offered before. There will be many beautiful views of and on the various cliffs with water views aplenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll&amp;nbsp;take a wooded trail to the foot bridge over I-691, then through the woods to join up to the Metacomet Trail&amp;nbsp;and go steeply uphill and on to the peak of West Peak at 1,024 ft. We will continue to follow the Metacomet along the ridge of West Peak and going to the north. There should be multiple overlook opportunities. We will cut east on an unmarked trail over a pipeline to meet up with Edgwood Rd. and do about a mile of roadwalking to get back to Merrimere Resevoir. We will hike on the lightly used road along the reservoir taking in the water and views of the cliffs on the other side. Eventually we are&amp;nbsp;back to the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at the large parking lot on the northeastern side of Mirror Lake (see map below) and we'll hike from there. Due to the distance and some up/down I would rate this hike moderate. You must bring a quart of water and trail appropriate shoes. A small backpack would be advised to carry water and maybe a snack so hands are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximate location/directions to meeting location&lt;/strong&gt; (parking lot to to north east of lake: West Main St to Notch Rd., Meriden, CT): &lt;br /&gt;
