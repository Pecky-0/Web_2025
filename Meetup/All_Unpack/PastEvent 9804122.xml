I expect that this will fill up fast so please RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;AND&lt;/i&gt; make your payment (see below) to hold your spot by May 15th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skillshare will include: &lt;br /&gt;An indoor session to start that covers... &lt;br /&gt;*Overview and suggested reading &lt;br /&gt;*Where to obtain cultures &lt;br /&gt;*Equipment &lt;br /&gt;*Sterile Tissue culture (with 3-5 practical demonstrations)  &lt;br /&gt;*Spawn making &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potluck Lunch (please bring your own potluck kit!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon you'll head outside to plug some logs.  Aaron says:  &amp;quot;I have started spawn for *Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) *Grifola frondosa (miatake / hen of the woods) *Laetiporus sulfureus (chicken of the woods) *Lentinula edodes (shiitake).  With a little luck i should have extra spawn, so people who are interested can bring a few freshly cut (within a few months) hardwood logs to inoculate and bring home.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cost is $5 to $10 donation on a sliding scale.  However, no one will be turned away due to lack of funds so if this fee presents a problem pls contact the meetup organizer, as barter or time donation could potentially replace the cash donation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pay by PayPal on this site or by using the &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/215138/Permaculture_GenRegistration.pdf"&gt;registration form&lt;/a&gt; and sending a check.  Payment must be received by May 15th to hold a spot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>9</waitlist_count><updated>1243695517000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235411863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skillshare:  Home Mushroom Cultivation I</name><id>9804122</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243083600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/9804122/</event_url></item>
