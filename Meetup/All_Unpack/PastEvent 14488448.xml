(see meetup email for BBQ RSVP)  Both Kayaking and BBQ is a short 10 minutes drive from the Route 3 South highway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This email is to RSVP for kayaking ONLY.  There will be a subsequent email to RSVP for the BBQ after kayaking.  &lt;u&gt;You don't have to kayak to come to the BBQ!!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayaking is a flat $25's and is a fresh water flat paddle for all levels, pretty easy paddle!  Please mention in the comments section if you'd like to include a guest and if there's plenty of room, I'll send you an email so you can add them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.billingtonseakayak.com/location.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOTE DIRECTIONS&lt;/a&gt;:  Please follow the directions from the website as it's off the beaten path where GPS may not provide accurate enough directions &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>8338847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285614806000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282340449000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our Last Kayaking Event for the Season</name><id>14488448</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284217200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/14488448/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/4/global_17172772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
