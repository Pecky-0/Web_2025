What consitutes &amp;quot;clutter&amp;quot; anyway? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Tuesday our guest will be &lt;b&gt;Sandra Tollos&lt;/b&gt;. She's not a professional organizer, or ADD coach, or reformed messie. She's just a naturally organized person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? Sandra says she doesn't make her bed every day and that she has some piles of stuff - but she knows &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; where every single thing is in her house. She tosses magazines and files receipts. She gets rid of clothes she she no longer wears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did she get this way? What's she doing that we're not? Come join us and hear the &amp;quot;confessions of a naturally organized woman&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://declutter.meetup.com/113/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please enter through Homer Street door...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254269055000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Accountability Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>declutter-113</urlname><id>963536</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Tools for Decluttering, Personal Change &amp; Goal Attainment</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220145957000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Confessions of a Naturally Organized Woman</name><id>8655268</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245193200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/declutter-113/events/8655268/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/d/global_5119229.jpeg</photo_url></item>
