Everyone showed up this time so this system seems to work: pleaseÂ message me to reserve a spot and try to be on time. If you e-mail me after the roster is full, I will keep you in mind if someone cancels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This game is for Yankee C- and above level only. Players are required to know how to play a 6-2 and 5-1 formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. If not, it's a one-time $20 membership fee that is good for a year (they don't take cash). Those who paid at the Orient Heights Community Center can use their cards at this gym too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is street parking by the gym and a parking lot. Once you are on Medford St, take your first right and the lot is on your right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also 5 minute walk from the Sullivan T stop and Bunker Hill College stop.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katya Starostina</member_name><member_id>20237091</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1353038105000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352477287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>High Intermediate Indoor Volleyball</name><id>90680072</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353024000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/90680072/</event_url></item>
