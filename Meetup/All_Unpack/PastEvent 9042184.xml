The owner describes it as &amp;quot;a bit European, a bit traditional, a bit contemporary&amp;quot;.   If you haven't seen it yet you have to come and check it out, it's a beautiful addition to New Haven.   (And if you've been inside The Colony Hotel, the hotel this one replaces, be prepared to be in-shock when you walk in!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specials for The Collective will be free appetizers and perhaps a drink special or two, TBD.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact is Ed: (203) 583-9668&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226068370000</updated><rating><average>4.57999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>39</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225141317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour at the All-New Study Hotel on Chapel Street!</name><id>9042184</id><headcount>41</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225753200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9042184/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
