We're still trying out various locations for our regular monthly social meetup, for June, we're going to try Tavern in the Square in Porter Square. It is easy to get there on the T, and should not be too expensive. We'll probably talk about the books, television, movies, comics and games that we like (and those we don't like, and even those we may be ashamed to admit that we like), but there is no set agenda!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask for the Sci-Fi Meetup when you get there, or look for our little red Meetup sign. You may also want to ask for &amp;quot;Science Club&amp;quot;, because somehow, that's what John Harvard's thought we were last week. Hope you can join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have a table sign, and we will tell the restaurant about the meetup.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247005786000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241615693000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup</name><id>10351104</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243983600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/10351104/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
