For one low price $6 you can sample beer and hear a band! It's a little difficult to find but well worth the trouble. It's located in the industrial section of Holyoke and if there are any signs I haven't seen them. The first time we went we found it by following the crowd of people walking into an old factory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's usually crowded and loud, but it's also lots of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a table - bring some cards! Good Idea from those young wipper snappers.&lt;br /&gt;Play for who goes to the bar for the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey all this is fully copied from the &amp;quot;That's not a beer. This is a beer.&amp;quot; meetup that I went to.  I had a great time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there is more, after Paper City closes down - Stony's (South Hadley) is down the road a brew pub, food, beer, pool, music and sports on the b-tubes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the table's get there early!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212962989000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>This group rocks!</why><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210555261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paper City Brewery a ton of fun - in a crowd</name><id>7919780</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212789600000</time><rsvp_limit>250</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7919780/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/a/global_4098570.jpeg</photo_url></item>
