Show your support by joining our meet-up group. The Political Exploration and Awareness Committee (PEAC) will be providing petitions, campaign materials, signs, polling documents, and other tools to provide our members and supporters with the means to make this a successful campaign. As the era of big government knocks on our door, with the support of people who maintain a high level of respect for small and constitutional government, we can rid our Senate chambers of a big government sympathizer like Chris Dodd and replace him with a true advocate for the cause of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEAC is looking for CT activists to organize and administer meet-up groups in support of a Peter Schiff Senate run for Chris Dodd's seat in the U.S. Senate. Please visit our website at www.schiff2010.com and contact us at schiff2010@gmail.com with your interest, support, questions, or suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may have almost 2 years until the election, but the time is now to start laying the groundwork for a successful run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our kickoff meeting. Plan to attend this historic event for CT!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234312473000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233535716000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Connecticut Supports Peter Schiff for U.S. Senate (CT) February Meetup</name><id>9649926</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234029600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/9649926/</event_url></item>
