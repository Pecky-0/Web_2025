From &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/calendar/event.asp?eventkey=29810&amp;amp;date=10/28/2007" target="_blank"&gt;MFA's website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Dhamma Brothers by Jenny Phillips, Anne Marie Stein, and Andrew Kukura (2007, 76 min.). A dramatic tale of human potential and transformation, The Dhamma Brothers documents the stories of thirty-six Albama prison inmates who enter an extended Vipassana retreat, an arduous and intensive course of silent meditation lasting ten days. Challenging assumptions about the nature of prisons as places of punishment rather than rehabilitation, the film raises the question: is it possible for these men, some of whom have committed horrendous crimes, to change?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can watch a trailer on the &lt;a href="http://dhammabrothers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times review of the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The inmates' letters started to arrive at Jenny Phillips's home in Concord, Mass., during the summer of 2002. For five years they've kept coming - 200 at last count, written by 14 men serving time in the Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison with a death-row capacity for 24 inmates outside Birmingham, Ala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Jenny, you have become a driving force of inspiration in my life,&amp;quot; read one typical note, from Edward Johnson, now serving a life sentence for aiding and abetting a triple homicide.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/movies/13dhar.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank"&gt;Rest of the review&lt;/a&gt;. (probably requires registration)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I know, the film-maker(s) will be available after the show for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Q&amp;amp;A, we will head to a local restaurant for discussion and food. &lt;br /&gt;Amit will be holding a meetup sign near the front row of the auditorium after the Q&amp;amp;A session is over.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193782270000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191854277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Dhamma Brothers</name><id>6510756</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193608800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6510756/</event_url></item>
