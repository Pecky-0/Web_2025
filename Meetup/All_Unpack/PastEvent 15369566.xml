In addition, with the holidays coming up, it made sense to schedule one meetup in December instead of trying to squeeze one in right around Thanksgiving and then again right around Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we'll be meeting on Dec 15 at the Portland Pie Company on Elm Street in Manchester. This is a new pizza place that opened a few months ago. They're known for their unique and gourmet types of pizza. I've heard very good things about it and have been dying to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on to the books we've chosen. We're doing one fiction, one non-fiction just like last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our fiction pick is called Little Bee by Chris Cleave: a story of two women whose lives are intertwined with each other because of a fateful decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our non-fiction book is Waiting for Superman, a series of essays that are meant to tie in with the new documentary of the same name. The documentary has generated a lot of buzz so I thought it would generate some really good discussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As before, you don't need to read both books to show up at the meeting, but you can if you wish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 person cap as usual and if you RSVP Yes and can't make it, please update your RSVP so another person can join us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>9</waitlist_count><updated>1292587729000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289156770000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A little pizza, a little beer, and two books.
