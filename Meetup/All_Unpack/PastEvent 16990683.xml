<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Please join us for the second of what we hope will be a weekly event! Knitters and crocheters of all skill levels are invited to share the joy of yarn creativity, deep discussion, fun conversation and tea cake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cathy McIntyre of Gloucester has generously offered to teach those of us new to the art of knitting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beginners please bring a pair of knitting needles and  maybe practice yarn. I have some yarn on hand as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Advanced knitters please bring along your work in progress and perhaps a finished item to show off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others doing hand work with fibers and fabrics are invited to join as well. We'd love to see you're projects!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring the bell at the door inside the front porch</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300904455000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>It's a valuable and relaxing skill that allows us a chance to talk about loftier subjects while creating something beautiful and useful.</why><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1300662330000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Knitting Group</name><id>16990683</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300899600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/16990683/</event_url></item>
