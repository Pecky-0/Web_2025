I guarantee that you will never look at Regional Planning Commissions, Land Trusts and Zoning the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I'll provide a direct link between the International Soci...alists Party and the current "Forest Legacy Program" being pushed by area Land Trusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Local agriculture is under attack by the same UNelected bureaucracies that are claiming to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I'll explain the critical difference between Visioning/ Consensus and the democratic process designed to protect the Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I will show you a grant application to HUD that touts the UN's "Agenda 21" as one of four primary Sustainable Development resources in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event if free, open to the general public and there's lots of available parking. Please share this event link with your friends and family and encourage them to RSVP as well. Seating is limited so please sign up and get there a little early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Liberty, &lt;br /&gt;
