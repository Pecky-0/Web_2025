So, I thought we could check that out.  We can also go to other islands, walk around on trails, eat lunch, fly a kite, toss a frisbie, etc .... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ticket kiosk is located adjacent to the Marriott Long Wharf Hotel and Christopher Columbus Park.  It's near Tia's and Starbuck's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ferry leaves at 11am sharp!  So, we'll meet between 10am to 10:30am at the ticket kiosk.  Please give yourself extra time to find the ticket kiosk.  Look for me near the kiosk.  I'll hold a sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions to bring:  camera, sunscreen, lunch, water, snacks, comfortable walking shoes, kite, frisbie and whatever else you can think of.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket price is $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest T is the blue line to the Aquarium.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their website for more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonislands.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonisla...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186495534000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184619218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ferry Boat Ride to Boston Harbor Islands</name><id>6032535</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186322400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6032535/</event_url></item>
