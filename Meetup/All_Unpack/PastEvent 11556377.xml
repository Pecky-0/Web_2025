As your options and invites start to open up, consider joining us instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join other transplants for a yummy day of food, fun, friendship, maybe even football? One of our members - Beth - has just bought a new home near Providence College and is very excited to open up her home (and her large basement kitchen and rec room) to all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hosted Thanksgiving at my place last year. With 5 newcomer friends, I can honestly say it was one of the best Thanksgiving days I have ever had - great conversation and Manny even washed while Matt dried all of the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll email those who rsvp closer to the event to give you directions and contact information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. She has two wonderful dogs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259437859000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254783565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thanksgiving Potluck</name><id>11556377</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259251200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11556377/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
