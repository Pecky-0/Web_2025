To walk for a good 2 hours we will likely have to take a tour of the South End also. Either way we will end up at the Empire Garden restaurant in Chinatown to have yummy dim sum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are arriving by T, you must go to North Station, exit to the street, then enter the TD BankNorth Garden commuter rail station. The walk will start at 10:45.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197301161000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196044884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rose Kennedy Greenway walk &amp; Dim Sum</name><id>6802716</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197127800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6802716/</event_url></item>
