&lt;p&gt;City Farm is home to the Rare and Unusual Plant Sale every year. One weekend in May, hundreds of varieties of annuals, perennials, and fruit and vegetable plant starts are available for purchase. Most of the 18,000 plants were carefully cultivated through the late winter and early spring on-site by the City Farm team, including dozens of volunteers. Hundreds of other perennials and annuals are donated by generous local gardeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This celebrated event attracts 2,000 gardeners from all levels of experience, from the brand-new community gardener to seasoned home gardening experts. It is a wonderful kick-off to the growing season, featuring live music and several gardening experts on hand to assist gardeners new and old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plant Sale is a community event, and a community effort. All proceeds from the Plant Sale support Southside Community Land Trust's education and community gardening programs, and plant starts that are not sold are donated to over 30 area non-profits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This is an open event, not necessarily one where we have to be in a group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Benjamin</member_name><member_id>4205154</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337517594000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334951634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Southside Community Land Trust Plant Sale</name><id>61437112</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337436000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/61437112/</event_url></item>
