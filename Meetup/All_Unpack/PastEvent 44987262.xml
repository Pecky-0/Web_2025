It should be fun if the weather co-operates, sharpen your blades,dress warm, see you there! You'll know me as I will be wearing my ice skating pants, their desert camo, can't miss me, I skated there Christmas night, what an awesome place! If you guys like it, I will set a meetup for an evening skate near future, ice rink right across from Biltmore Hotel,Downtown Prov. see you Sat. Weather permitting. P.S.
