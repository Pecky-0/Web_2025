A wacky comedy about three inept murderers who are also a love triangle.  Plots are hatched, plots fail, alliances are formed and broken.  Who will survive? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mapleton Hall, 1305 Mapleton Ave, Suffield, CT.  A restored historic 1883 building, the home of The Suffield Players, a community theatrical group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be such a popular play that many of the performances are sold out already!!!  Thus the need to change the date and reserve tickets in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $15.  I have reserved 12 seats already.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrive by 7:30 pm please.  Meet me (Linda Karen) at the entrance.  I will have your ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 91 N to Rte 190 W to Rte 159 N (East St) to Mapleton Ave (a left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot/Beer/Bill...After the play, we'll go to The Shamrock Cafe, 1117 East Street South (Rte 159), Suffield.  This is a full service bar with pool (billiards), pinball and other bar games, entertainment and food.  A local joint.  Open until 2 am.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173141353000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Connecticut Arts - Theatre Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Theatre-Group</urlname><id>326612</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>Connecticut Theatre Group Arts-Theater Events Group Discount</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166303735000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DATE CHANGED AGAIN!
