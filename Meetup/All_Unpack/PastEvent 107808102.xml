We've read some deep, dark novels lately, but this one is supposed to be quirky and heartwarming– a perfect read for springtime! As an added bonus we can do movie night as soon as it comes out on video (Maybe in May?)! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Below are descriptions of the book from Amazon and Publisher's Weekly &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 From Amazon: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;“Aawww shucks!” NPR's Nancy Pearl said. “I know that’s hardly a usual way to begin a book review, but it was my immediate response to finishing Matthew Quick’s heartwarming, humorous and soul-satisfying first novel . . . This book makes me smile.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;Meet Pat Peoples. Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure him a happy ending—the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. (It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent several years in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat’s now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he’s being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he’s being haunted by Kenny G!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 From Publisher's Weekly: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;Pat Peoples, the endearing narrator of this touching and funny debut, is down on his luck. The former high school history teacher has just been released from a mental institution and placed in the care of his mother. Not one to be discouraged, Pat believes he has only been on the inside for a few months––rather than four years––and plans on reconciling with his estranged wife. Refusing to accept that their apart time is actually a permanent separation, Pat spends his days and nights feverishly trying to become the man she had always desired. Our hapless hero makes a friend in Tiffany, the mentally unstable, widowed sister-in-law of his best friend, Ronnie. Each day as Pat heads out for his 10-mile run, Tiffany silently trails him, refusing to be shaken off by the object of her affection. The odd pair try to navigate a timid friendship, but as Pat is unable to discern friend from foe and reality from deranged optimism, every day proves to be a cringe-worthy adventure. Pat is as sweet as a puppy, and his offbeat story has all the markings of a crowd-pleaser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather M</member_name><member_id>2005368</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366982159000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>literary critics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Reading-Sharing-and-Laughing</urlname><id>1551608</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Reading, Sharing and Laughing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362530400000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book Discussion - The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick</name><id>107808102</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366930800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Reading-Sharing-and-Laughing/events/107808102/</event_url></item>
