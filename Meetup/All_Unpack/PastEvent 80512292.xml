Turn onto Hemlock Road (school will now be on your left and fields on your right). Continue straight past Landrigan Field; stay to Right of entryway and continue straight to end of parking lot. There is an entrance to the Reservation on the right. Since it will be a Saturday you can park anywhere with no problem. &lt;br /&gt;

This will be a repeat of the very successful meetup we had on June 5, 2010. You can read about it and also look at the great pictures uploaded by Emma, by going to the Past Meetups page of this site, scrolling down to June 2010 and clicking on "More" at the end of the little description. &lt;br /&gt;

As before, Rain will cancel this meetup.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348530843000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346606321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate the first day of Fall at Breakheart Resrvation in Wakefield</name><id>80512292</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348326000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/80512292/</event_url></item>
