The book holds wonderful message about self-empowerment, the law of attraction (although it is not referred to as such!) and other valuable skills one is better for if one is to live a spiritually based life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are honored to have Paul who is a trainer in the Seven Habits to come and help us gain a deeper understanding of this important work, which is certainly worth revisiting if it has been some time or visiting if you have never read the book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, come for good food, good conversation and a great time.  Bring enough food to feed at least four people and we will see you soon!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250375253000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245539092000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seven Habits of  Highly Effective People!</name><id>10697660</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247954400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/10697660/</event_url></item>
