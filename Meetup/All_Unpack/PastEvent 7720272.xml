<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a second try to run a mystery and intrigue module. Since last time was cancelled due to player mis-expectations, please &lt;b&gt;read carefully and ask questions&lt;/b&gt; before committing. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is extensive info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. DM or organizer's name and preferred contact info: I will DM. &lt;br /&gt;2. City/Location of the most common place you will be playing: Stoneham.&lt;br /&gt;3. Campaign world for the game: Not applicable, not full-fledged world&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;What you really need to know and think about&lt;/b&gt;: It is a &lt;b&gt;DARK&lt;/b&gt; story. &lt;i&gt;Individual character goals may not be the same as party goals&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;5. System: DnD 3.5 will be used, but the game is mostly not dependent on DnD, although player knowledge with the system is preferred. Don't expect standard DnD adventure! Yes, I could do this in  but I won't. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this module the style is:&lt;br /&gt;Roleplaying: 8&lt;br /&gt;Action: 2.5&lt;br /&gt;Story: 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More detailed info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a preset module for 6 players plus/minus 1. It's a module in a fantasy world, so all conventions apply. It starts with some adventurers accused of a crime that may result in some heads rolling. There is also a dark prophecy that hangs over the city... but maybe there is a way to figure out what really happened and change what will happen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some restrictions:&lt;br /&gt;Players cannot select character race, background, etc. There will be 6-7 characters to play. Some things are open for personalization though, e.g. alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will use 3-3.5 edition rules. However, it will be ROLE PLAY biased, so don't expect to select an ability from the rules and tell DM that it does X instead of Y. Also don't expect a lot of combat or leveling. It's much more a brain game than brawn game though combat can still save your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, individual character goals may not be the same as party goals. This is not going to be Paranoia, but it's also not going to be &amp;quot;happy elf meeting in a meadow&amp;quot;. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game starts in an isolated town, an outpost of civilization in wild country (think Roman Britain). The genre of the game is mystery. Religion will play a substantial role and will be taken from Player's Handbook ed. 3. Characters start at about level 6 and may finish at the same level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are short descriptions of characters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Name: (Joshua Drake)&lt;br /&gt;Class - fighter&lt;br /&gt;Race - human&lt;br /&gt;Alignment: any.&lt;br /&gt;Size of prehistory: 7&lt;br /&gt;Other: sergeant of city guard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.
