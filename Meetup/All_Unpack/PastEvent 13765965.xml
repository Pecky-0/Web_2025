I've seen &lt;b&gt;Westworld&lt;/b&gt; (directed by Michael Crichton) dozens of times, but haven't yet seen &lt;b&gt;Dark Star&lt;/b&gt; by John Carpenter. They are both part of the Harvard Film Archives special SF-1970 film series.  Yul Brynner as a menacing robotic &amp;quot;black hat&amp;quot; cowboy in a Wild West Theme park is harmless until something mysteriously goes awry... he's scary as all heck, especially when stalking his prey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dark Star&lt;/u&gt; is at 7:00 pm. &lt;u&gt;Westworld&lt;/u&gt; is at 9:00 pm. I think there is a half-hour breal between movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Price&lt;/u&gt;: I believe each movie admission is $12.00 for each film, if I am not mistaken. It's pricey, but it still will be good to see both of them in 35 mm. Let me call to see if you see both you get a discount. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be in The Garage on 36 JFK Street &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-garage-cambridge" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5:45 pm in the lower level food court. There is a Subway that serves sandwiches, and a Taqueria nearby. Feel free to drop in! We can start walking over at 6:30 pm to the Harvard Film archive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Dark Star, from the Harvard Film Archive:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2010aprjun/sf1970.html#dark" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Directed by John Carpenter &lt;br /&gt;With Dan O'Bannon, Brian Narelle &lt;br /&gt;US 1974, 35mm, color, 83 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;John Carpenter’s notoriously irreverent sci-fi satire revolves around a deep space crew of slackers, a bomb with a brain, and a ship’s computer provocatively named Mother. The bored crew has been stranded in space for over twenty years on a mission to destroy planets that could pose a threat to Earth. To pass the time, they muse philosophically on their mission while janitor-turned-astronaut Pinback clowns around with his alien sidekick&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Westworld, from the Harvard Film Archive:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2010aprjun/sf1970.html#west" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Directed by Michael Crichton. &lt;br /&gt;With Yul Brynner, James Brolin, Richard Benjamin &lt;br /&gt;US 1973, 35mm, color, 88 min. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Crichton wrote and directed this boldly satiric cautionary tale where theme parks cater to every male fantasy with robots tailor-making the generic backdrop of the customers’ formulaic dreams – including the recreation of an 1880s Wild West frontier town. Yul Brynner gives one of his most iconic performances as an armed and wickedly dangerous robot drone who potently symbolizes Crichton’s dark vision of a corporate future shaped by entertainment fantasy&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Harvard Film Archive:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/general_info.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Harvard Film Archive offers a public cinematheque program, presenting films Friday through Monday nights year round. All screenings are held in the Archive's 200-seat theater located in the historic Carpenter Center for the Arts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The HFA frequently invites filmmakers to discuss their work and engage with the vibrant community of students, professors, artists and cinephiles who regularly attend Archive screenings. Recent visitors include the French director Agnès Varda (Les plages d'Agnès), American screenwriter and director Paul Schrader (Blue Collar), Catalan director Albert Serra (Birdsong), American independent filmmakers So Yong Kim (Treeless Mountain) and Lance Hammer (Ballast), Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel (The Headless Woman), Irish director John Boorman (The General), and Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong (Secret Sunshine), [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The HFA's collection of 35 and 16mm material for almost 14,000 titles, as well as its many posters and documents, are accessible to faculty and students at Harvard, as well as to outside researchers, through our academic research services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Established with the assistance of the Luce Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1979, the Harvard Film Archive has grown into an incomparably rich resource for scholars and filmmakers. A division of Harvard University's Fine Arts Library, the HFA is an affiliate of the International Federation of Film Archives&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/general_info.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Harvard Film Archive is located in the lower level of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at 24 Quincy Street, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We are east of the Harvard Square Red Line T Stop, in between the Harvard Faculty Club and the Fogg Art Museum, one block north of Massachusetts Avenue between Broadway and Harvard Streets in the Harvard University campus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;u&gt;Parking&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Although parking in Cambridge is difficult (most of the surrounding streets have restricted parking for Cambridge residents only), metered parking on Broadway and Harvard Streets, as well as the rest of Harvard Square, is free after 8pm. Film-goers are encouraged to use public transportation, particularly the MBTA Red Line&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
