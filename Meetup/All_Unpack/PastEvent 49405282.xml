&lt;p&gt;To add to the Super Bowl festivities, I'll be hosting a viewing party at the *NEWLY OPENED* Barney Fanning's in Boston's Financial District. In the location that was formerly JJ Stats, Barney Fanning's just opened and is ready and rarin' to go to host a Super Bowl extravaganza! View their menu here: &lt;a href="http://www.barneyfannings.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.barneyfannings.com/&lt;/a&gt; or find them on Facebook. For those unaware, Barney Fanning's pays homage to the "Broad Street Riots". A short article is here: &lt;a href="http://bostonrestaurants.blogspot.com/2012/01/barney-fannings-to-open-in-former-j.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://bostonrestaurants.blogspot.com/2012/01/barney-fannings-to-open-in-former-j.html&lt;/a&gt;. Barney Fanning's is conveniently located in Boston's Financial District, within short walking distance from the T (Downtown Crossing, South Station, State Street, Aquarium) and street parking is available all around the side streets. Everyone is responsible for their own food and drinks. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO. And please remember to tip your bartenders/servers. I look forward to seeing you! GO PATRIOTS!!
