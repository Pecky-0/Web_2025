<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi to All!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For July, the bankruptcy attorney I had hoped to schedule for our meeting will be on vacation.  I had hoped she could teach us about recent changes in the law, who can file, how it works.  I know I have some clients for whom a bankruptcy filing can be a helpful strategy in avoiding a foreclosure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this time I do not have a speaker for us.  But based on past experience, there are many members of the club who can offer insights on investing, financing, landlording, market trends.  I will prepare some updated information on the real estate market now that we have gone through our Spring surge (?) to share.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come ready to talk about your RE investment interests and experiences.  Any newbies, come with questions.  Either someone there will have answers, or we will find answers for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set the day aside- July 7,  7-9PM.  And see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and go down the stairs to our meeting room on the lower level.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216741996000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Experienced investors and newbies.
