&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: I have Hiked  these Trails &amp;amp; Roads Quite a  few times.  I want you to feel comfortable &amp;amp; not worry about getting Lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting Season is here, but only Archery. Shotgun Season in December, is the most Dangerous.  You only need 200 sq. inches, of Orange.  I will bring a couple of Vests.  I will be wearing one of my Orange Riding Jerseys. You can get a Cheap Vest at Walmart for around $ 5.00.  I am not concerned, because we are on " Roads " &amp;amp; Archers usually do not shoot, unless they know what they are shooting at.  FYI: I Hike in the Woods with Archers &amp;amp; even Muzzleloaders, all the Time.  You will not find me in the Woods, where Hunting is allowed,  during Shotgun Season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to Ride, for a couple of Hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
