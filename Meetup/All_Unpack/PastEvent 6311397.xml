Jeff will share his secrets on how you might still be able to get paid on a deal you recently had to walk away from because you did not have the knowledge, resources or capital to pull it off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topics include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* How partners actually ADD VALUE to your deals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* How and where to find these partners &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* How partnering can exponentially INCREASE your bottom line - NOT cut into it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Debunking the myths about why partners are NOT a good idea &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* How to determine what your partner should receive for their contribution... it is not    always an even distribution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Whether you can't seem to buy that first property, or you just aren't earning enough to quit your J.O.B., if you are not where you want to be in your real estate investing career, Jeff will show you how to get there and how to get there FAST! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foreclosuresmass.com/education/view/readmore/eid/6/" target="_blank"&gt;Pre-Register for Turning the Key&lt;/a&gt; and save $5.00!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 3372062</member_name><member_id>3372062</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191711742000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Serious Real Estate Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonreia</urlname><id>358354</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Real Estate Networking/Education Meeting in Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189123886000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Turning the Key: Partnering for Profit</name><id>6311397</id><headcount>127</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191538800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonreia/events/6311397/</event_url></item>
