There will be a 5K Trail Race, 5K Walk, and lots of family friendly activities. Fleet Feet and REI will organize the race and walk and host clinics about running, walking, and hiking. The Connecticut Woodcarvers Association will hold a "Carve a Walking Stick" session. Letterboxes are in the woods and DEEP's &lt;span&gt;Sessions Woods Conservation Education Center&lt;/span&gt; will be open for you to enjoy and learn more about Connecticut wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration begins at 8:30 a.m., the 5K Trail Race begins at 9:30 a.m., and the 5K Walk starts at 10:00 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5K Trail Race fee is only $25. The race fee will be waived for those who raise contributions of $50 or more. Walkers will be asked to raise funds to support CFPA's programs.&lt;/p&gt;
