Many of us find our workplace-, extended family-, or friend-network-conversations' views heavily tilted towards the left.  This meeting can serve as an antidote, as a friendly respite, as a place to pass on and gain  perspective and ideas in accord with traditional American values and process.

Of course there is no one single conservative perspective on issues.  We debate, we listen, we learn.  This is a good meeting for friendly discussion.  The people who come are bright, lucid, open, and forthright.  Some people are more politically active than others.  There's no specific political activity requirement or partisan affiliation.</description><rating>4.39</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1066858789000</created><lat>42.3499984741</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>95</id><urlkey>republican</urlkey><name>Republican Party</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>99</id><urlkey>libertarian</urlkey><name>Libertarian</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1670</id><urlkey>conservative</urlkey><name>Conservatives</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2359</id><urlkey>youngrepublicans</urlkey><name>Young Republicans</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3383</id><urlkey>townhall</urlkey><name>Townhall</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4521</id><urlkey>rlc</urlkey><name>Republican Liberty Caucus</name></topics_item></topics><name>Boston Conservatives' Meetup Group</name><id>155655</id><members>315</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>10643147</member_id><name>Austin Hess</name></organizer><urlname>townhall-61</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/9/9/600_3409561.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/9/9/highres_3409561.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>3409561</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/9/9/thumb_3409561.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/townhall-61/</link><lon>-71.0699996948</lon></item>
