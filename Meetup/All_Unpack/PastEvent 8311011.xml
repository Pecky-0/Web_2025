Let's go see Wall-E. I hear it's a terribly creative movie that's basically a shoe-in for the animation Academy Award. I've seen a LOT of promotion in my 2 trips to Disney parks so far this year, and it looks really fantastic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Borrow a kid or two if you want to share in the child-like joy of this movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Show time is 3:30, so let's meet between 3:00 and 3:15 outside the theater. Then I'll go buy everyone's (discounted to $8.50) ticket and we can go get snacks, etc. After the movie, we'll go somewhere to chat (Fridays has been our haunt lately) and get some food and get to know each other better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests are always welcome! Just make sure you note how many you're bringing so that I know who to expect (and bring the right amount of tickets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who's in for some animation fascination?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry for the short notice on this one. Hope you can make it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For day-of RSVPs and any questions about directions or latecoming, give me a call on my cell: 508/308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting out front of the theater.
