Are you truly aware of your fears and programs from the past that may be holding you back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tantric Path accepts our body as the gateway to our emotional and inner self. By using the body's energetic sources we can surrender to love, learn to trust the world and learn how to live in the present moment. Our body's energy can provide pleasure as well as heal, provide emotional cleansing from the past as well as help us face our fears.  Our bodyâ€™s energy can bring happiness into our lives and help us remain in the present moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this half day-long workshop we will use Tantric tools to explore and become more aware of our bodies' energies.  We will also begin to open ourselves to both giving and receiving more love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This workshop is open to all who have participated in one of our past workshops or an event presented by another Tantra instructor.  Both couples and singles are invited to attend.  Exercises will be introduced in a safe and gentle manner and all boundaries will be respected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early registration, (prior to October 10, 2010) $29.00 per person&lt;br /&gt;Regular registration (after October 10, 2010) $38.00 per person&lt;br /&gt;Please copy/paste the link below to register using PayPal or Credit Card&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;amp;hosted_button_id=PZM5LLTDW5KEC" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.paypal.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information contact;  Ashimoremethod@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Imani</member_name><member_id>7960334</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287948091000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285711147000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Tantric Path to Body Awareness:An Intermediate Level Course</name><id>14929814</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287943200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/14929814/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/b/global_14702587.jpeg</photo_url></item>
