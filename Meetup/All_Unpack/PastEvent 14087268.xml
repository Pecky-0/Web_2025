Main Street, this should be across from the Main Stage. &lt;br /&gt;If it is blocked off, go further into the Main St. festivities and the State House Lawn will be the alternative spot to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liz's directions for getting to the general area: &lt;br /&gt;Rte 93 North - Exit 14 LEFT towards State Offices&lt;br /&gt;Left at NH 9 W - Loundon Rd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for Parking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk  to North Main Street and take a LEFT,&lt;br /&gt;The meeting place will be on the right side of the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is Friday night and traffic can be dooming... we will wait for half an hour, while enjoying the events on the Main Stage.... so if you are late, we will be as close to 125 as we can be to enjoy the show. Look for Doggies, Hugo, Barney and Maddie are a for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I created a quick graphic of the meeting area, the colored square represents the Stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Street Concords 36th annual Market Days and Summer Music Festival will be 9am to 10 pm each day the 15th thru 17th of July and dogs on leashes are welcome.
