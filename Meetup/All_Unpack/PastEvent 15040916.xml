By the next day, all you wanted to do is get out of there.  Fortunately, old FAN Alliance has an escape for you, its called games.  Even if this doesn't describe you, come over anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a potluck, so bring over your favorite leftover from Thanksgiving or a dessert and your favorite games. I will email directions to those who RSVP YES.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290861899000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286500653000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>After Thanksgiving Games</name><id>15040916</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290794400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/15040916/</event_url></item>
