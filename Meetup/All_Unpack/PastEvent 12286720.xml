It is  chanted daily in the monasteries and Zen Centers of China, Korea, Japan, and the United States. For this discussion, you are encouraged to read the book by Mu Soeng, and also to explore other perspectives on this very important sutra and the concept of &amp;quot;emptiness&amp;quot; that you may have discovered in other books, as well as your own personal perspective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several versions of the Heart Sutra available in English on the internet. I recommend the version published by the Kwan Um School of Zen:  &lt;a href="http://www.kwanumzen.com/practice/chants/heartsutraenglish.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Maha Prajna Paramita Hrdaya Sutra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Heart of the Universe - Exploring the Heart Sutra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Mu Soeng&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the bold and intriguing assertion of the Heart Sutra, a text of seminal importance to the Buddhist tradition made even more fascinating by its deep resonance with the cutting edges of quantum physics and cognitive science. In spare and approachable language, &lt;i&gt;The Heart of the Universe&lt;/i&gt; deftly explores this gem of world religious literature from a variety of perspectives—historical, spiritual, linguistic, and scientific—each serving to interdependently illuminate the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;“Mu Soeng's  &lt;i&gt;The Heart of the Universe &lt;/i&gt; is a brief  thought-provoking commentary on the Heart Sutra. In his introduction, the author, who is the scholar in residence at the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies, reminds the reader that the sutra has a history, and that all who have read—and chanted—it have done so within a specific cultural context. For Soeng, quantum physics—the scientific insight that the basic particles of matter are actually in constant flux-informs how the sutra is understood in the modern West. Of course, any discussion of the Heart Sutra is going to center on the concept of emptiness—the Mahayana theory that all phenomena are without fixed and independent identity. Soeng presents his fascinating discussion of emptiness early in the book, leaving little to say when discussing the famous line “form is emptiness, emptiness is form” in his line-by-line commentary.”—Buddhadharma (magazine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mu Soeng, a former Zen monk and teacher, is the co-director of the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies. He is the author of two books on Buddhism, &lt;i&gt;Thousand Peaks: Korean Zen-Tradition and Teachers&lt;/i&gt; (Parallax Press) and &lt;i&gt;Heart Sutra: Ancient Buddhist Wisdom in the Light of Quantum Reality&lt;/i&gt; (Primary Point Press - 1996). He lives in Barre, Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published 2010 - List Price $15.95 – 128 pages – Wisdom Publications - 800-272-4050   &lt;br /&gt;-  www.wisdompubs.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aurore Eaton</member_name><member_id>3983123</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274787362000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People interested in Buddhism</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha</urlname><id>447070</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Manchester Buddhism Sangha</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263226224000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Continued Discussion:  The Heart of the Universe by Mu Soeng</name><id>12286720</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273532400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha/events/12286720/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/6/global_13398950.jpeg</photo_url></item>
