<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>At the August Meetup we had a surprise visit from Plone guru Kapil Thangavelu. Kapil ran through a couple of demos and we installed the Plone mailing list product listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the September Meetup, we will continue development on the Plone skin, and install the Poi issue tracker. For a full  list of items to be worked on, see the not-officially-launched bostonplone.org website &lt;a href="http://www.bostonplone.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonplon...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great chance to get your hands dirty with Plone, ask questions of more experienced Plone developers, and contribute to making a great resource for the Boston Plone users community. All skill levels are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the south entrance of the collanade building. The entrance is located at the center of the long building running along the reflecting pool. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The parking is on the intersection of Mass Ave and Huntington and as stated is $15. If you park in the garage: &lt;br /&gt;You should use the Sunday school exit (there are huge painted signs) to exit the garage and walk out on the plaza to the colonnade entrance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You should tell the security guard that you are here for the Plone User Group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.bostonplone.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonplone.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonplon...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159920185000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156464477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone September Meetup</name><id>5095542</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158879600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/5095542/</event_url></item>
