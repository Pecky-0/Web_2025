Well, I re-checked the MFA's calendar and lo and behold, I can make it to the screening on May 12th. As our group has grown we have begun to have multiple group events for the same movie- and I hope members who have been 'shut-out' of Nicole's meet-up can make it at this date and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film Tom will be holding a meetup-sign near the front row and then its off to discuss at a local eatery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details from Nicole's posting (thanks again Nicole!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Search of Mozart by Phil Grabsky (2005, 120 min. Video). Without resorting to docu-drama or visual re-enactment, In Search of Mozart traces the composer's life through his music and extensive correspondence. Over 80 works are featured in chronological order, revealing striking parallels between the music and Mozart's own experiences. Throughout, it is the music that takes centre stage, with the jigsaw of Mozart's life fitting around it. His letters reveal an extraordinary personal voice, which rings out on an engaging, human level, full of joy, passion, pain, rage, jokes, bawdy humor and sensitivity. With rigorous analysis from musicologists and experts--such as Jonathan Miller, Cliff Eisen, Nicholas Till, Bayan Northcott and the late Stanley Sadie--a new, vivid impression of the composer emerges. It dispels the many common myths about Mozart's genius, health, relationships, death and character, to present a new, very different image from Milos Forman's Amadeus. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179162632000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178157356000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mozart- One Mo Time!</name><id>5735916</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178989200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5735916/</event_url></item>
