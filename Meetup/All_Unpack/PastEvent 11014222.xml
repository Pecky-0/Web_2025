Some of the questions on our discussion – DESIGN to SELL – Are:&lt;br /&gt;1. What are all the possible target consumer markets that you can choose to fit with your particular design style?&lt;br /&gt;2. How can you find out more about your particular consumer that you are targeting? &lt;br /&gt;3. What are the best selling categories today that would be good to aim toward? &lt;br /&gt;4. What kind of design styling is good for the particular consumer you are targeting? &lt;br /&gt;5. What are some of the best ways to reach your particular consumer? &lt;br /&gt;6. How does production cost and selling price affect  certain markets? &lt;br /&gt;7. How do fabric and resources affect certain markets? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to RSVP, make sure you come with something to “show”, sketches, photos from magazines, your clothing designs or someone else’s clothing. Also remember that we can only have ten. We love small groups to accomplish results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you Saturday, Aug. 8, 10 AM in Quincy. If you have any questions, please email me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes,&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley, Organizer of BDL)&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer, Boston Fashion Industry Meetup&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>A sign, Boston Design Lab</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250807125000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249224485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Design Lab: “DESIGN to SELL”</name><id>11014222</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249740000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/11014222/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/3/global_9986579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
