Films are shown mostly at the Somerville Theater in Davis Square, and the Brattle in Harvard Square, over a period between April 22 and April 28.  In between are multiple film possibilities all weekend, and an exhausting attempt to see them all, including ones at the ICA and the Coolidge Corner Theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, you can attend the 2nd Annual International/Arthouse Film meetup group Pow Wow to be held on Sunday afternoon, April 19, at the Grafton Street Pub, in Harvard Square, near the Brattle and the HFA. At the Pow Wow, we plan to go over the full schedule of films, find out what the buzz is for certain films, see who is going where and on what night, organize meetups and get togethers, so that we can attend as many of the films as possible with fellow film friends and turn this festival into a community event that enables us to enjoy these great, first-run, films with friends in the audience, and stimulating discussion afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be open to as many as 40 people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come if you are a long-time member of the group and want to attend the festival with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come if you are new to the group and want to experience the fun of seeing great independent films with others - instead of by yourself. Walk into each theater and recognize others in the audience, sit with friends, and look forward to talking about the fims afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come if you are interested in the International/Arthouse Moive Meetup Group but haven't been to your first event. Enjoy some brew, meet new friends, and look forward to the Independent Film Festival in a way that you never thought possible living in the big city. Turns out there are like-minded film fans from all over the country who live in Boston, and this is the perfect way to connect to this community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come if you have anyting to do with the festival, have nothing to do with the festival, have been to the festival, or plan to just see one film at the festival. Bring a guest, enjoy the discussion, and become part of this group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a complete list of films: &lt;a href="http://iffboston.bside.com/2009/" target="_blank"&gt;IFF Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be the group with IFF Boston Schedules spread out on the tables,</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239186852000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd Annual IFF Boston Pow Wow</name><id>10142410</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240164000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/10142410/</event_url></item>
