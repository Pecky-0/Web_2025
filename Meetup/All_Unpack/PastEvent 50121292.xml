<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We'll gather at Gloria's home in Windsor for a potluck dinner with a green food theme in honor of St. Patrick's Day.&amp;nbsp; When you RSVP, please say what you are bringing, so we don't just have green salads with green goddess dressing, okay!&amp;nbsp; Anyway, we know you can be more creative than that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have all turned into certified greentooths (if you don't know what a greentooth is, just know that it's worse than a redneck!), we'll take some time to review this year's scholarship applications and select our winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just so no one dawdles with the scholarship applications, fun and board games to follow.&amp;nbsp; Bring your favorite game or Gloria's household has a few that usually lead to laughing so hard the line for the bathroom becomes frantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's in a private home, address and directions will only be sent to those who RSVP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332005152000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327865262000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Green food, games, and scholarships</name><id>50121292</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1331937000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/50121292/</event_url></item>
