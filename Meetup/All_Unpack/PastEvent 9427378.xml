<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We're always outnumbered at co-ed events, so this gathering is just for the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the group!  Let's get together to have a drink and enjoy each other's company.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the bar area near the entrance.  Hopefully we can get one of the big tables.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll send my cell number to Yes and Maybe RSVPs a few days before to use in case you have trouble finding us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event info will also be posted on the Boston Republican Party Meetup Group and will be sent to members of the HUB Republican Women group.  It's also posted on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/editevent.php?picture&amp;amp;eid=47536315779#/event.php?eid=47536315779" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;Feel free to spread the word to other Republican women you know and bring your friends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several parking lots in the neighborhood and the nearest MBTA stop is Central Square on the Red Line.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the bar area and try to get one of the big tables.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>4385831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234913124000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>(young) Republicans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>youngrepublicans-43</urlname><id>170358</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston (Young) Republicans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230924361000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Republican Women Meetup</name><id>9427378</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233705600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/youngrepublicans-43/events/9427378/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/2/global_6414994.jpeg</photo_url></item>
