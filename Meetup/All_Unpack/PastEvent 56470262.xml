We're just Springing Ahead one week. Karen Macedo, faculty at MCC will be presenting on Illustrator. She will be giving an overview of Illustrator, comparing how some things are familiar to a Photoshop user, and somethings that are different as well as some of the cool things you can do with AI.&amp;nbsp; If you have anything to share, we welcome that as well. We hope to see you all on Thursday night, 3/22/2012 at 6:00pm!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
