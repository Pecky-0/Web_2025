Marilyn also runs a successful jobseeker networking group of her own, the "Create the Opportunity" Meetup Group in Waltham, which you can also check out at: (www.meetup.com/opportunity). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Assuming Marilyn&amp;rsquo;s 4G internet connection is working properly, she'll give us a live walk-through of a some top social networking sites to demonstrate ways to kick your search into warp speed using social media! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alternatively (barring an internet connection), Marilyn will be happy to introduce us to her Rules for the 21st Century Job Search: an empowering path to re-employment using brain science." Fascinating stuff!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope you can join us, and look forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;;-&amp;gt; Ben &lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------ &lt;br /&gt;Tonight&amp;rsquo;s Agenda: &lt;br /&gt;6:00 - 6:30 pm: Refreshments and networking &lt;br /&gt;6:30 &amp;ndash; 7:00 pm:  Individual introductions to the group (who you are / what you're looking for) &lt;br /&gt;7:00 - 7:30 pm:  Marilyn&amp;rsquo;s presentation  &lt;br /&gt;7:30 - 8:00 pm:  Q &amp;amp; A / more networking &amp;amp; information exchange &lt;br /&gt;If you're a hiring manager, recruiter, or entrepreneur looking to hire staff, please feel free to bring along handouts about your company and open positions and/or business cards.   &lt;br /&gt;_________________________________ &lt;br /&gt;A note about parking:  There are metered public lots on Green Street (the block behind Tavern in the Square.
