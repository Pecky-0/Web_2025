Following the separation from her husband (Matthew Broderick) and the death of her adopted mother, April is contacted by her apparent birth mother (Bette Midler), who turns out to be a local talk show host Bernice Graves. As Bernice tries to become the mother to April that she was never able to be, April seems to find solace in the arms of the parent of one of her students (Colin Firth), only to find that the mystery to life?s questions cannot be solved by a simple revelation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screening starts at 7 p.m. on Monday, May 12, at the Jane Pickens Theater, 49 Touro St., Newport. Tickets are $10, or $8 for Film Newport members, and can be purchased at the door starting at 5:30 pm on the 12th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attending the screening to answer questions will be Elinor Lipman, who wrote the novel upon which the screenplay is based&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet to the left of the concession stand.
