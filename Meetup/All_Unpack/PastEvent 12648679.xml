We will hike on Saturday, March 27th at 10am.   As I noted earlier, I am unfamiliar with the Woodlands - but I will study the trails so that we can have an enjoyable hike.  I have been told that there will be &amp;quot;back-tracking&amp;quot; on these trails as the &amp;quot;points of interest&amp;quot; are located at the end of the trails (ie: Journey's end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Old woods road meandering to Bessie's Point overlooking Fosters Pond. Some of the trees, rhododendrons and laurels growing along the roadway in Goldsmith Woodlands were planted by Bessie Goldsmith herself. Note the avenues of black pines, so dense that few plants can grow beneath them. Lady slippers abound here in late spring and other plants rarely seen are visited by Harvard University botanists. The marshes adjacent to the pond are home to cattails, pitcher plants, sundew, snapping turtles and Great Blue Herons. The uplands provide habitat for resident deer, fisher, fox and wild turkey while owls patrol the margins&amp;quot;.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details and to review the trail map - &lt;a href="http://www.avisandover.org/goldsmith.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.avisandove...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Victoria &amp; her black PT Cruiser - 617-285-9385</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria</member_name><member_id>4404403</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>16</waitlist_count><updated>1270062102000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266603237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Goldsmith Woodlands, Andover, MA</name><id>12648679</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269698400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/12648679/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/global_13194259.jpeg</photo_url></item>
