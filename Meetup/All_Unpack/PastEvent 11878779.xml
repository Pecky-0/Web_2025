Itâ€™s been some time since the BBTC hosted a dance, so if you haven't already been to a Tall Dance, where you are not looking down on the whole group, here's a rare chance since these dances don't happen so often anymore.  I remember my first Tall Dance, and it was quite an experience to be among so many tall, not to mention well-dressed people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a a VFW hall, which may sound casual, but here's the description: &amp;quot;This brand-new, beautifully appointed hall has hardwood floors throughout for dancing, a full bar, and plenty of parking. It has the distinction of being the first VFW post in Massachusetts to be named for a Vietnam veteran. Their bartender will take care of all your beverage needs, there will be plenty of munchies, and a DJ will provide tunes to keep your feet happy!&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not only open to tall people -- anyone can come, so you can bring a friend if you'd like, even if they are not tall. And please come up and say hello to me, Linda -- I'll be easy to spot because I'll be wearing a black dress with red roses down the front! Perhaps I can introduce you around...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $12 at the door, or $10 in advance, and you can pay through PayPal at this link: &lt;a href="http://tall.meetup.com/15/calendar/11822662/payonlinenow/"&gt;http://tall.meetup.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Route 95: Take exit 28, Trapelo Road, east toward Waltham/Belmont.
