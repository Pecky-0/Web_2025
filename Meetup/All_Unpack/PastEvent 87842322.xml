According to the recorded message at Moseley's, the doors open at 7:30pm(lol, I will try to be there at 7:30). Beatlejuice starts at 8:30pm, with two 90 minute sets. This is a +21 event :(. Tickets are $15 at the door. The 36 bus drops off it looks like about a 1/4 mile away(and runs until 1:00am). They probably have a ton of parking(given that it's a big hall). The recorded message states "dress code is casual but neat".&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a meetup button/will give out Cell Phone # the night before.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kirk, "Rear Admiral"</member_name><member_id>4863083</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351464151000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350766228000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beatlejuice in Dedham/on the Boston line 10/27 at 8:00</name><id>87842322</id><headcount>7</headcount><duration>12600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351382400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/87842322/</event_url></item>
