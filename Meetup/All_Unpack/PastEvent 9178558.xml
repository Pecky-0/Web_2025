There's a full kitchen with a microwave, fridge, etc. Sign up on the Message Board, but really, anything goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWAPS!&lt;/b&gt; If participating in this month's themed swaps, bring your 6 finished cards and drop them off at the registration table as you arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YARD SALE!&lt;/b&gt;Got stuff you want to sell, trade, give away? Here's your chance. See the Message Board for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;GROUP ACTIVITY:&lt;/b&gt; We'll be doing the Found Poetry Challenge, an easy activity combining words and images. All materials and instructions will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lots more!
