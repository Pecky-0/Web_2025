Thirteen people attended and there was a lively and thoughtful discussion of The Help.&lt;br /&gt;       On February 28th we'll be discussing The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a stark look at the high price Guernsey had to pay during World War II.&lt;br /&gt;       Those of us who have already read it, really enjoyed it and felt we had a better grasp of what people went through when the Germans occupied their island for five years.&lt;br /&gt;       Tentatively we've set People of the Book as our book for March.  Any feedback is welcome and please go to the picture page to see some photos of our most recent meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elaine    </member_name><member_id>7294680</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267564481000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264377921000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Brookline Book Club</name><id>12411203</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267390800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/12411203/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/4/global_12779508.jpeg</photo_url></item>
