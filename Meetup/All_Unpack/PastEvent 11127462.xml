I would be willing to meet people one hour earlier to converse and socialize before the music and the dancing starts. Please let me know if you like meet at 8pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know we got some Forro dancers out there and would love to see you all there, and of course, save a dance for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some information about this New York-based Forro band compiled of both Brazilian and American musicians:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Curto's Forró For All is a band dedicated to Northeastern Brazil's traditional &amp;quot;forró pé de serra&amp;quot; performed with a style born out of New York City's diverse and dynamic musical culture. Forró is the accordion-based party music of the sertão, the dry interior of the Brazilian Northeast. Led by rising accordion star Rob Curto, with musicians from Brazil and the U.S., the band creates a sound that deeply respects the great masters of forró. Curto's virtuoso accordion playing and the band's diverse musical influences bring a fresh perspective to forró with improvisation, original compositions and innovations in rhythm and harmony. .&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/artist/robcurto.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/artist/robcurto.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.johnnyds.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;l&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/forroforall" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/forroforall" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252017527000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250477343000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forro For All - at JOHNNY D's </name><id>11127462</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251421200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/11127462/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/9/global_10238121.jpeg</photo_url></item>
