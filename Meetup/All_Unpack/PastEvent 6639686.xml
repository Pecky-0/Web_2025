A few of you have asked me about having a &amp;quot;Portuguese Round Table,&amp;quot; and  the organizers for the Portuguese language meetings at Harvard has allowed us to join their group for those who wish to practice the language.  Anyone may attend, regardless of proficiency-- even if you just want to sit and listen at first.  They meet every tuesday at 6:30 pm at John Harvard's Brew House at Haravard Sq for about an hour or so.  Rebekah one of the organizers said that she to get a place by the bar tables next to the&lt;br /&gt;faux stained glass.  I am posting for next week since this is a rather early notice but if you like to go to tomorrow go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um abraco,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolina&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194738617000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193694938000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portuguese Round Table</name><id>6639686</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194391800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/6639686/</event_url></item>
