<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>NEW STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7:15. So let's meet by 6:50 and head in at 7:00. This is a BIT later than the original time, so if it changes any of your plans, feel free to RSVP until about 4:00 tomorrow. After that, give my cell a ring if you wanna come. (508-308-4897). See you tomorrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;It's about time for a chick flick. (That's not to say that you men aren't welcome or appreciated, too. So don't be shy if you wanna see it!) Let's go to &lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809926850/info" target="_blank"&gt;The Women&lt;/a&gt;. I hear it's a cute little film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 6:25 on Wednesday evening, so let's meet outside the theater by 6:10. Call me if you're gonna be late so I can wait for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the short notice, but I wanna go out this Wednesday. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, we'll go to TGI Fridays and discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests, as always, are welcome. Just be sure to include them in the RSVP so I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as always, discounted tickets for my Framingham Movie Meetup friends is $8.50. And I also have discounted small popcorn and small drink tickets ($3 each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell for last-minute RSVPs or &amp;quot;I'm lost&amp;quot; calls: 508-308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222899633000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222043109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Women</name><id>8804521</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222298100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/8804521/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
