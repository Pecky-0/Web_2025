I'll be in the theater lobby 30 minutes before showtime (7:05), and we'll head into the theater playing the movie ten minutes before showtime (7:25).

I'll be wearing my red hat with the meetup logo. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables near the window. If downstairs, I'll be behind the rope where the tickets are torn across from the popcorn stand.

For new folks, if you miss the gathering before the film, no worries, we regroup after the film just outside the room where the film shows. And then we go out to discuss the movie over munchies and a beer. Or two. 

[b]Synopsis[/b]

The characters of C.S. Lewis' timeless fantasy come to life once again in this newest installment of the "Chronicles of Narnia" series, in which the Pevensie siblings are magically transported back from England to the world of Narnia, where a thrilling, perilous new adventure and an even greater test of their faith and courage awaits them.

One year after the incredible events of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe," the Kings and Queens of Narnia find themselves back in that faraway wondrous realm, only to discover that more than 1300 years have passed in Narnian time. During their absence, the Golden Age of Narnia has become extinct, Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines and is now under the control of the evil King Miraz, who rules the land without mercy.

The four children will soon meet an intriguing new character: Narnia's rightful heir to the throne, the young Prince Caspian, who has been forced into hiding as his uncle Miraz plots to kill him in order to place his own newborn son on the throne.
