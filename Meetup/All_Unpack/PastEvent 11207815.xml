Let's enjoy the last of the fall foliage while we get some exercise, walking and talking with friends in the crispy fall air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Sleeping Giant, which is a Connecticut State Park located in Hamden.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN: Sleeping Giant is a great park for any level of hiking.  We will walk our usual tower trail, which is relatively short, has a mild incline, and requires very little maneuvering over rocky places.  We will have a break at the tower for snacks and chit chat, and if there is interest, we can split up into two groups after our break -- some members walking back down the tower road (totaling a 1.5 hour hike), and other members heading down the blue trail, if they desire a greater challenge (2+ hour hike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the big trail map at the Park entrance, which is located on Mt. Carmel Avenue, between 8:45 and 9, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by five after 9. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: One or two bottles of &lt;b&gt;water&lt;/b&gt;!, and a snack if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  &lt;b&gt;layers&lt;/b&gt; of clothing; warm socks, hat and gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please see &lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/Dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325264" target="_blank"&gt;Sleeping Giant State Park Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: The DEP sometimes charges a fee to park in the lot.  Please take advantage of the street parking on Mt. Carmel Avenue, adjacent to park, ACROSS FROM (not inside) Quinnipiac University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail maps are usually available at the park entrance, if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing red</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258655755000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251312717000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Hikers' Sleeping Giant Walk</name><id>11207815</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258207200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/11207815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/0/global_7947184.jpeg</photo_url></item>
