Plus James Franco is a great actor, and Mila Kunis does sometimes pick out a good script. Could be terrible of course, but probably it won't be boring with all the eye candy. So let's give it a try!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now know the time of the movie. We will be seeing the 7:05 IMAX show. Fandango is somewhat confusing, since they are selling the non-3d, 3d, and IMAX 3d seperately. Here's the thing - if you do not see a 7:05 showtime, you have the wrong version of the film, or possibly the wrong theater. You want the IMAX 3d, Boston Common, 7:05 show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

If the movie is upstairs, I will be waiting at the tables near the front windows. If the movie is downstairs, I will be across from the refreshment stand. We'll head into the theater 20 minutes before showtime. Yes I know that means we will all be waiting a while, especially if you add it to the 20 minutes of previews, but hey, it'll give you a chance to talk to your neighbor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather outside the theater showing the film after the film ends. And then we go out for a discussion 'n' food 'n' beer. Or wine, or cocktails, according to your preference. :-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes there is an advice section now. :-) I suggest the following: 1) buy your tickets ahead of time on Fandango.com, it's a bummer when the movie sells out and you don't have tickets, plus if you print them out at home you don't have to deal with lines; 2) if you're going to come to dinner 'n' drinks bring cash, that makes wrapping up the bill easier; 3) comments on the event should be reasonably appropriate, right? We want to make everyone feel welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disney's fantastical adventure "Oz The Great and Powerful," directed by Sam Raimi, imagines the origins of L. Frank Baum’s beloved character, the Wizard of Oz. When Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he's hit the jackpot--fame and fortune are his for the taking--that is until he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity--and even a bit of wizardry--Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
