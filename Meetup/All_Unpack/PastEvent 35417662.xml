&lt;p&gt;Newspapers are reporting that Boston is expected to receive an equivalent turnout to the protests taking place in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar events are taking place across the country and our growing. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spread the word like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demonstration will start this Friday 9/30 at 6:00pm in Dewey Square, in the vicinity of the Federal Reserve of Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Red Line to South Station, won't be hard to find the crowd from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Bring a sleeping bag and your heart. Check out the scene if you are on the fence. Power in numbers. The more the merrier. For those staying the course, Food Not Bombs will be providing food. Many are planning to stay there weeks if possible, those with fire in their hearts and minds hope to take up shop for months. Do something with your life. Be the change you want to see in the world. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The proceedings will be kicked off following the coinciding of the HONKS parade to Davis Square, a weekend long festival of activists who perform brass music. Though in no way affiliated. &lt;br /&gt;
