<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>In May we will be discussing the second part of the Secret Book of John. Please download the .pdf from the &lt;a href="http://gnostic.meetup.com/178/files/"&gt;Files&lt;/a&gt; section of the Meetup group and bring your questions and insights for discussion. Members of the Meetup group get a special MP3 version of the reading that they can listen to on their iPod or whatever you crazy kids use to listen to your music :)&lt;br /&gt;Part one of our Secret Book of John discussion ended with the creation of Yaltabaoth the Demiurge (or chief archon, as this text calls him) though the error of Sophia. Thus part two begins with Yaltabaoth creating archons for himself. It goes on to name the archons that he creates and their powers, and ends with the creation of the first perfect man, Adam. Not much goes on to further the action of the story here, but this section is filled with detail and symbol that can be poured over for years. We're only taking one month, but it's a start!&lt;br /&gt;We have the UU church again for this month's meeting so we will be performing the Service of the Logos for the first time. That can also be found in the Files section. Here's what we need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - Someone to volunteer to read the reading. (Done: Eric)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - Someone to bring coffee (Done: Abby)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - Someone to bring a snack (Done: Pam)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll handle the printed material and the supplies for the Logos Service. Please RSVP either Yes, No, or Maybe. It really helps us plan for our meetings. Please also note the slight shift in the time of the meeting, we changed it in order to give people more time to travel.&lt;br /&gt;And as always, please contact me with any question, comments or concerns!&lt;br /&gt;In Gnosis,&lt;br /&gt;Anthony&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
