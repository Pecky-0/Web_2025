Hope many can attend!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to hold meetings in the back meeting room at the Wood-n-Tap, 99 Sisson Ave, Hartford, CT.  The Wood-n-Tap is a nice, casual place with good food.  As before, I have not arranged for any formal meal, we can simply order off the menu as we please.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first meetings have been basically informal events.  Most of our last meeting was conducted in Russian, but do not let that discourage you if you are a beginner like me, simply bring along a dictionary and jump right in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been growing slowly each month and hope to see some new faces this month! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I will be out of town for this month's meeting, but it will be led  by Nika.  See you all in March! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.
