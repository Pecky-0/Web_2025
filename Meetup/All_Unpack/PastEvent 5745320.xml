An educational program that teaches accounting, finance, and investing at the same time and makes learning fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unique Rich Dad game teaches financial intelligence - how to understand the game of money and investing (skills not taught in school) ... and makes learning fun! The CASHFLOW board game is recommended for adults and children age 10 and older. You can now join like-minded individuals and play the CASHFLOW board game.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to meet other local fans of the financial board game Cashflow 101 by Robert Kiyosaki. We are a group who use the Cashflow game to network with others who desire to take real action steps to get out of the Rat Race. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome to come and play or watch and learn (all levels and skills are welcome).&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180980576000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178391907000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Metro Boston Cashflow June Meetup</name><id>5745320</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180807200000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/5745320/</event_url></item>
