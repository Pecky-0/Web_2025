&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;Connecting to your Inner Wisdom to Get “Unstuck”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;Note: Through mid November, we're collecting &lt;strong&gt;non-perishable foods and clean, in good condition clothing&lt;/strong&gt; to donate to A Place to Turn, which provides emergency food and clothing to those in need in about 30 towns in Metro West MA.  This is totally voluntary.  No pressure.  If you feel inclined, please bring what you'd like to donate.  We're &lt;strong&gt;accepting financial donations, as well&lt;/strong&gt;; as there is great need on all counts.  Thank you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;Do you feel an inner “tug of war” over some things, like, “I wish –x-, but I also want –y-.” (I want to be thinner; but I also want to eat what I want!”) One part of you wants one thing, but another part wants something else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;Do you hear yourself saying, “I can’t.” or “I wish I had the willpower or discipline to do that.”?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;Do you feel stuck in some part of your life you wish you could get on with?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;These are often signs of having an inner conflict or a limiting belief around what you want. Would it be nice to end the suffering caused by what seems like an inner battle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;Tonight, through a combination of instruction and guided inner, meditative processes, you can discover how what seem like inner enemies can actually be your inner allies when you connect inwardly in the right way.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 By participating in this experiential evening, you’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to reach a satisfying and comfortable resolution to your inner conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to more easily and spontaneously act in ways that fit with who you want to be as a person, honoring all parts of yourself, without any need for will power or discipline, but with ease and flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to open up new possibilities for yourself in something you’re currently feeling emotionally drained by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;All are welcome to this free community event! The evening is appropriate for everyone. Please invite others to sign up and join you. Share this with your friends, family and groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px ; text-align : left"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Overall, it was a wonderful experience! It was great to connect with my inner self through the meditations as well as learn a new technique that allowed myself to be at peace (instead of stuck) with certain struggles. Thank you!” Amy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space is limited, so registration is required.  Please plan on arriving around &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;7:10&lt;/span&gt; to get settled so we can begin on time; and &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;please be considerate and be sure to let us know if your plans change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px ; text-align : left"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It was much more than I expected. It was a wonderful foundation for resolution to a conflict I’ve had for years. I feel free and lifted with the guidance I received tonight.” Cassandra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
