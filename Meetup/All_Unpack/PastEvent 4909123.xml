Set in Iran, it's the story of the author's childhood in the era just before and after the overthrow of the Shah.  This differs from previous books we've read because it is a graphic (comic-book style) novel.  (My Name Is Red, like Zadie Smith's On Beauty is too long for the book club, unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Name is Red is over 400 pages and we are trying to keep books&lt;br /&gt;to 350 or fewer pages so that people have enough time to finish a book&lt;br /&gt;and work :).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rajeev</member_name><member_id>2508562</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>International Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-427</urlname><id>216983</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Reading books by international writers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1145826311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reading books by international writers May Meetup</name><id>4909123</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1148241600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-427/events/4909123/</event_url></item>
