Hope you have caught your breath. Killer loss to the Yanks, I had to deflect many jokes at work today, but we must move on and keep our heads high. The next step is of course against our old northern rivals, the Russians!  If you can't get up for just Russia (madness!), recall 4 years ago, this was the team the nailed our coffin shut and left us bruised and bloodied to finish 7th overall with a 2-0 QTR final win. So revenge is an understatement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So grab your Canuck paraphernalia: flags, whistles, bells, antlers, raccoon tails etc and throw back on that unlaundered Canadian attire and join me back at the Greatest Bar opposite the TD gardens to cheer on our boys once more in the quest for gold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thegreatestbar.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Greatest Bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transit:&lt;br /&gt;Take the T Green Line inbound to North Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Canada Go!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In a sea of red and white</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce Turnbull</member_name><member_id>4018534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267229575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266884301000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Round 2: Quarter Finals Canada v Russia!</name><id>12678059</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267056000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/12678059/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/1/global_12885905.jpeg</photo_url></item>
