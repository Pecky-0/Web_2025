Finally a chance for lots of us to gather without having to travel so far south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toy Soldier is in Amesbury, right near 495, 95, and the NH border. &lt;br /&gt;Parking is on-street (no meters) and driving directions can be found at their website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amesburygames.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amesburyga...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the first meetup for the northern group, there's no set agenda, but we'll have snacks and we encourage you to bring a friend!  Anyone looking to run a game?  Anyone looking for players for a new or existing game?   &lt;br /&gt;Come with an open mind! Bring your ideas!  Bring a pencil! Bring your dice!  &lt;br /&gt;A game could spontaneously break out at any time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Room in the back - or ask the person at the counter</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suechan</member_name><member_id>4481496</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220987133000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219756544000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Calling all North of Boston Gamers!
