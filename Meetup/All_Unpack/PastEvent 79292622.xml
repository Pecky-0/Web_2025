It's a blast! This will be our fifth party. Ask anyone who may have attended one before and they will tell you they had a great time! We will be having the the Murder Mystery party at the Scenic theater, &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This murder mystery game is not a board game; everyone will be participating at the same time; you must not be afraid of the dark, and you must dress all in &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;black clothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;! This is not a show. We will be in a big old scary theater with two or three large rooms; plenty of space to wander around in and hide victims! &lt;br /&gt;

At 6 pm we'll have dinner, I will explain the game and give a brief tour of the theater. At 7pm the murder mystery will start. This is not a child event so please do not bring your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will buy food, appetizers, drinks, condiments, cutlery and plates. Hotdogs, BBQ chicken, wraps, salads, mixed fruit, chips, dip, watermelon and deserts too. I'll keep the costs low at $15 per person. (To be paid in person at this event) Iâ€™ll bring a cooler with ice, too. If others want to bring some ice and coolers that would be great, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not doing a potluck because we all know that a few members usually don't show up and don't bring the food they've signed up for. Potlucks usually end up with alot of desserts and less varieties of food. As I have planned this event, there will be a greater diversity and balance of food, with less pressure on members having to figure out what to bring. I will need help setting up, cooking and cleaning up afterwards so please let me know if you'd like to volunteer: I'll need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 setup volunteers to show up at 5 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 clean-up volunteers to clear away dinner. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please attend only if you are willing to &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;actively&lt;/span&gt; participate. This is not a spectator event, be aware this event is played in nearly dark rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of free parking in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scenic Theater is on main street across from Citizens Bank. &lt;br /&gt;

More details will follow as we get closer to the event. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you have any questions call me (Peter) at 603-312-6735. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

See you there for a memorable night! &lt;br /&gt;
