Donelans is located at 145 Lincoln Rd Lincoln, MA and is part of a gray, modern looking &amp;quot;strip mall.&amp;quot; There is a large parking lot with plenty of spaces-I suggest parking in the back of the lot where the supermarket is.  It is actually conceivable to take the T there (commuter rail-North Station to Fitchburg line - Lincoln  stop) - see www.mbta.com for details - but I recommend getting a ride if you don't have a car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk goes from Donelans/Lincoln Station to Walden Pond, and then back.  It takes a tad over two hours.  The walk goes through forests and fields, some up and down portions, a couple quiet streets to cross, and ends up at Walden Pond.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll then have lunch at a restaurant in Waltham center at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margarita's Mexican Restaurant &lt;br /&gt;Address:   211 Moody St, Waltham, MA 02453  &lt;br /&gt;Phone: (781) 893-9990&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luba</member_name><member_id>3354277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213108504000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212366487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lincoln Station - Walden Pond Walk</name><id>8057195</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212935400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/8057195/</event_url></item>
