For those of you who don't know what cosmic bowling is - the bowling alley dims the house lights, lights the lanes, has disco balls, music, fake smoke - things like that - it's FUN!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're planning to meet 7:30 pm, Friday, November 13th at Boston Bowl, just outside  Quincy near Neponsett Circle on Morrissey Boulevard.  Please plan to meet a couple minutes before to get shoes and schedule teams etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimum of 4 Participants (Non-organizers) by noon on Thursday, November 12th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizers: Susan (AO) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SSFMG and its organizers are not responsible for any injuries to participants or damage to equipment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpool: There is no carpool for this event. Members should meet at Boston Bowl. If you would like to carpool you may note where from in your RSVP comments and someone else may choose to contact you if they are also interested in carpooling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Thursday, November 12th @ 12:00 PM.
