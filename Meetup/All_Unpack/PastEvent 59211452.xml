Spring patrol is to clean winter(?)'s debris from drains. Two variations: 1) if enough people, use rope puller and webbing to safely pull hazard tree down from over trail, then buck 2 fallen trees to 6' lengths and use teamwork to tote them uphill to where they will replace wood steps from 1989 and 1995. 2) If too few people for 1, continue patrol on Ranger Cabin Trail and South Ridge Trail back down to cars. &lt;br /&gt;

 Regardless of which we do, figure 6 hrs from car back to car. &lt;br /&gt;

 Gear for dayhike per www.hikesafe.com. Wear long trousers and sturdy boots, BYO work gloves, plenty of food and at least 2 qt H2O. All tools provided. &lt;br /&gt;

 Trailwork is fun and getting good work done is satisfying. Try it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333880283000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333547626000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trailwork Mt Cardigan 4/7</name><id>59211452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333801800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/59211452/</event_url></item>
