Don't forget treats, cameras (usually end up wanting one!), warm clothes as of late, and a real good attitude! :) We have encountered a few ignorant people complaining about our "vicious dogs" (who are, by the way, remaining in perfect stays as they pass...), so please remember your thick skin and your dedication to demonstrating the most responsible owners of some of the best dogs out there! Our walk routine goes something like this: walk a ways, train/practice a new skill; walk a ways, train/practice a new skill... and we ALWAYS take the opportunity to work on our dogs attention to handler when bikes/rollerblades/strollers pass, i.e. "Here comes some bikes! Everybody, ask for a watch me/stay/sit, etc." We encourage all members to start walking groups in your areas! This is a great way to expose people to our dogs in a positive, responsible way!
