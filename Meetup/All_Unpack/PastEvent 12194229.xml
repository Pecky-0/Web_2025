Happy New Year to all! Hope everyone is enjoying their holidays?  I am excited that Dick and Jane will be at The Charlie Horse in a few weeks.  For those of you that have not heard of them, they are a fantastic cover band - here is their website where you can find their song list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dicknjaneband.com/about_us.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dicknjaneb...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They play great cover tunes of every music genre.  If you like to dance, you'll really enjoy the atmosphere.  There is a large bar that serves reasonably priced drinks, great apps and snacks.  They also have a huge room of arcade games and a billiard room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band usually goes on between 9-10pm and they play for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to gather a great crowd for this Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send out an email a few days before to let you all know what I will be wearing (so you can find me:-) and where to meet.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lisa</member_name><member_id>2136226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264385697000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fabulous Females</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore</urlname><id>1511961</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>South Shores' Fabulous Females Unite!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262400091000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dick and Jane at The Charlie Horse!!!!!</name><id>12194229</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264212000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore/events/12194229/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/2/global_10481810.jpeg</photo_url></item>
