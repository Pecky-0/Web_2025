You may be asking &amp;quot;What is Drinking Liberally?&amp;quot;   From the website: &lt;a href="http://livingliberally.org/drinking/about" target="_blank"&gt;http://livingliberall...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An informal, inclusive progressive social group. Raise your spirits while you raise your glass, and share ideas while you share a pitcher.   Drinking Liberally gives like-minded, left-leaning individuals a place to talk politics. You don't need to be a policy expert and this isn't a book club - just come and learn from peers, trade jokes, vent frustration and hang out in an environment where it's not taboo to talk politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bars are democratic spaces - you talk to strangers, you share booths, you feel the bond of common ground. Bring democratic discourse to your local democratic space - build democracy one drink at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While drinking liberally, always remember to drink responsibly, and make liberal use of designated drivers. Drinking and driving is reckless and irresponsible, like a neocon war or corporatist tax cut. Liberals, don't do it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event begins at 8 p.m.  For more information about the Wild Colonial Tavern please check out their website: &lt;a href="http://www.wildcolonial.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wildcoloni...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285281218000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Atheist</urlname><id>12929</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282267360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society - Drinking Liberally at the Wild Colonial -Sept. 22</name><id>14480383</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285200000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Atheist/events/14480383/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/0/global_13237216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
