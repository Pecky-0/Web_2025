There are trials through rock outcroppings (one goes by an interesting glacial boulder called Whale Rock which gives off the effect of a whale breaching land) and by and over a pond. The reservation has in fact five man-made ponds, which on the last two visits there rewarded us with a sighting of a Great Blue Heron. Some trails are short, some flat that tour wetlands, while there is a Pond Trail, with its long, narrow footbridge, that allows you to pause and take in a vista while looking at water lilies, fish, frogs, dragon flies etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Birds, bugs, fish, snakes, turtles and frogs were witnessed on last two visits. Fishing is allowed but we won't stop too long for that. If you want you can bring your pole and try your luck or hang back and fish after our visit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a ice cream/snack shack called Bubbling Brook Farms on the road to Rocky Woods where we can stop afterward for refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a ranger there you may have to pay a fee: Adult $4, Child (12 and under) FREE. Fees collected by ranger on weekends and holidays; honor system applies at all other times. The last two times I was there the ranger was not present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;Rocky Woods&lt;br /&gt;Hartford Street&lt;br /&gt;Medfield, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From I-95/Rt. 128 Exit 16B: Take Rt. 109 West for 5.7 mi.
