Rep. Susan Almy is holding a summit to consider changes to NH’s tax laws. Almy is one of the most vocal income tax supporters in Concord. Please read the Union Leader article at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unionleade.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.unionleade...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a lot of comments made and Almy responded with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Grow up. This is not secret, every member of my committee has been consulted, of both parties. It is not a summit, it is an informational session in which we are going to try to get business input on our current tax structure. And I am not going to name people we haven't invited yet! If they choose not to participate that's their affair. I would thank the Union Leader to check its facts before it trumpets its accusations. You are supposed to be a newspaper.&lt;br /&gt;- Susan Almy, Lebanon”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s not lose the NH advantage. Get your signs ready. No income or sales tax.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane</member_name><member_id>9612585</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256390293000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rochester-912-project</urlname><id>1452537</id><group_lat>43.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>Rochester 912 Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255616480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Income Tax Protest</name><id>11633246</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256216400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rochester-912-project/events/11633246/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/b/global_8616923.jpeg</photo_url></item>
