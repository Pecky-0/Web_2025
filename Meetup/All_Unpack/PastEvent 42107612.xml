&lt;p&gt;Hi gang, I am hosting a Thanksgiving dinner this Thurs. for those who may be out of town or still be in the process of learning how to sit down with their families without a hypertensive crisis. You don't need to bring anything besides a bottle of wine to share, unless you feel otherwise inclined. However, if there are more than eight people, we may need to turn the event into a buffet style dinner with people bringing a side dish. I live on 51 Lake Place in New Haven. This is the street right in back of the Yale gym. My unit is 5A. You may call me at 858-344-5383 or simply buzz. We will be meeting at 4pm and beginning dinner at 5pm. Given the vicinity to Yale hot-spots we may want to go for an after dinner cocktail at one of local venues. John&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Contact John at the number/location listed.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322234494000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322003863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thanksgiving Orphans</name><id>42107612</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322168400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/42107612/</event_url></item>
