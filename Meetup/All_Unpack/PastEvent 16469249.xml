Let's get some wintery exercise in the snow while we walk and talk with a group of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at &lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org" target="_blank"&gt;West Woods Trails&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Guilford Land Trust preserve in Guilford, CT. The park has many entrances, but for this hike we will meet at the SAM HILL ROAD entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at 11:55 at the Sam Hill Road entrance, and begin hiking at 12:05. We will hike for about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COST: Please contribute one dollar towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. Please donate no more than $12 per year -- you keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRAIL MAPS are available at Bishops Orchards and other locations as indicated on the &lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org/map_availability.htm" target="_blank"&gt;park website&lt;/a&gt;, if you are interested in getting to know the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS: For this hike, we will meet at the Sam Hill Road entrance. From I-95 exit 57. Go east on Route 1 approximately one and a quarter mile. At the second stop light make a right hand turn onto River Street. When the road ends, turn right onto Route 146 (Water Street).
