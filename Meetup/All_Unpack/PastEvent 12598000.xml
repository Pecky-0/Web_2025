I thought it would be fun to meet later and see a movie and then go to dinner.  I chose movies that start around 4'ish putting us at dinner around 6'ish.  This all depends on the time of the movie, of course, so we will all have to be flexible.  Movies available today (I'll update on Thursday as that seems to be when they change):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;Wolfman--4:30&lt;br /&gt;Dear John--4:15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valentine's Day--3:50 (favorite) &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Percy Jackson and the Olympians--4:25&lt;br /&gt;Edge of Darkness--3:40 (new addition)&lt;br /&gt;Shutter Island--3:30 (new addition)&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet in the Cafe inside the theatre, Studio 3 at 3:15 to gather and have a cocktail before the shows start.  Then after the movies we can go across the street for dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dinner, I thought Vinny T's of Boston would be fun. Here, you'll be enjoying fresh, homemade Italian inspired food by the neighborhood Italian restaurants of Boston’s North End, Manhattan’s Little Italy and South Philly in the 40’s. The true taste of homemade sauces that have been simmering all day, ingredients that are as fresh as they get, and all your favorite dishes, prepared just the way you like them. It's a traditional Italian family restaurant serving traditional Italian meal out of homemade pasta your sweet little Italian grandmother might have made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on out everyone, this should be a fun afternoon/early evening...you too, south shore Baby Boomers! &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at the Bar</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mindy</member_name><member_id>8014085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266957708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266097944000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Afternoon at the Movies Plus Dinner</name><id>12598000</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266784200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/12598000/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/9/global_11148425.jpeg</photo_url></item>
