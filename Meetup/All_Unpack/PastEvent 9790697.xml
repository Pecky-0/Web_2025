If you can get up to the Nashua park-and-ride (exit 6 on Rt3), you're welcome to pile in with us and share the ride.  Will need to meet us at that lot around 7am - let me know in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning on meeting at the Sunapee Lodge at 9am and heading out as a group.  Expecting to ride all day and hang out til the lifts close before we pack it in and head south again.&lt;br /&gt;I'm an intermediate rider, as is one of the others.  One beginner level rider is coming up and she'll be taking lessons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a high-visibility orange stocking hat on in the lodge</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill_J</member_name><member_id>4839704</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235835434000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235241997000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Snowboarding at Mount Sunapee</name><id>9790697</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235311200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/9790697/</event_url></item>
