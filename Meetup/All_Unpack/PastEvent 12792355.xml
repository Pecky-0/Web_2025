He's a co owner (right side only) of the famous Skyhawk N20071 with me, father, scout leader, attorney, and more. Let's make this happen for that group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Westminster Cub Scout Pack has asked me to help them plan their April pack meeting. The theme for the month is aviation and flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A requirement for some of the scouts is to visit an airport. I thought it would be a great if they could visit the Fitchburg Airport. I think it would be a good opportunity for the boys, the airport and for the FPA.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pack meeting is Saturday, April 10th in the morning.  There are 50 boys in the pack but they would likely not all attend. I could provide an exact head count and would figure about 35 to 40 boys from ages 6 to 12 years old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you be able to help me coordinate this with the AP and the FPA? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was thinking that they could break into 3 or four groups of boys and tour a few planes, hangers, shops and maybe have a ground school type of activity for them.  This may even be something that could coordinate with Young Eagles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Sounds like we'll need some planes, pilots, ...the usual... I&amp;quot;m sure they will be bringing their parents along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley and Dave, &lt;br /&gt;The Crew of Zero-Seven-One&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271213076000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267805126000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Westminster Cub Scout Pack Visit</name><id>12792355</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270906200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/12792355/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/7/global_13460535.jpeg</photo_url></item>
