<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Mike Potter from Adobe's Developer Relations team will be giving an overview of Adobe Flex Builder and how it integrates with a PHP based backend. Adobe Flex Builder is an Eclipse based tool that helps developers build Rich Internet Applications that get delivered via the Flash player. Using AMFPHP, you can easily connect a PHP backend with a Flash based front end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Potter has been developing websites and web applications for over 8 years. He has extensive experience with PHP, having created the website for the largest amateur sporting organization in Canada, the Canadian Curling Association. After developing that site, he went to work for OEone, where he helped build a Linux based desktop that ran inside the Mozilla web browser. He helped open the code to the calendar application in that desktop, and ran the Mozilla Calendar Project for 1 year after that. He joined Adobe a year ago, and is now working in Developer Relations as an evangelist for open source and web developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, after any healthy technical discussion food &amp;amp; drink must follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.BostonPHP....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1146785533000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP Meetup June Meetup</name><id>4923348</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1149201000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/4923348/</event_url></item>
