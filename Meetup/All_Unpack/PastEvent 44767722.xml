&lt;p&gt;It's 2001. The dot-com bubble has burst and rolling layoffs have hit an unnamed Chicago advertising firm sending employees into an escalating siege mentality as their numbers dwindle. As a parade of employees depart, bankers boxes filled with their personal effects, those left behind raid their fallen comrades' offices, sifting through the detritus for the errant desk lamp or Aeron chair. Written with confidence in the tricky-to-pull-off first-person plural, the collective fishbowl perspective of the "we" voice nails the dynamics of cubicle culture--the deadlines, the gossip, the elaborate pranks to break the boredom, the joy of discovering free food in the breakroom. Arch, achingly funny, and surprisingly heartfelt, it's a view of how your work becomes a symbiotic part of your life. A dysfunctional family of misfits forced together and fondly remembered as it falls apart. Praised as "the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684833395/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the business world" and "&lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; meets Kafka," I'm happy to report that Joshua Ferris's brilliant debut lives up to every ounce of pre-publication hype and instantly became one of my favorite books of the year. &lt;em&gt;--Brad Thomas Parsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be at the bottom floor with a copy of the book on the table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326910558000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1481208</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324156979000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris</name><id>44767722</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326843000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group/events/44767722/</event_url></item>
