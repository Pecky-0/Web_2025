&lt;p&gt;Meet UPSTAIRS in the LOUNGE/WORKOUT AREA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will go up to the Lounge/Workout area from 7 - 7:15 PM to meet people who prefer to show up at the regular MeetUp time. Check this MeetUp's comments and the Whiteboard near the bathrooms for a description of what I'm wearing. If anyone else arrives early, please write "MEETUP" and your name &amp;amp; what you are wearing on the Whiteboard. Seems like traffic is getting heavier (nicer weather, more people out and about), so I cannot guarantee anymore&amp;nbsp;I'll be there around 6 :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not already done so, please post a clear face picture of yourself on your profile so that I and other members can recognize you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If arriving later, just come find us on the walls. Hopefully you can recognize me (see "Event Host" right) from my picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toprope, sport leading, and bouldering available, including some tall walls up to 45 feet. If you'd like to lead climb, don't forget your to bring your rope :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never climbed here before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing. Call the gym or see the website below for more info. Full-access Day Pass $18. Bouldering-Only Pass $15. Mondays are Women's Night: Women's Day Pass $10.
