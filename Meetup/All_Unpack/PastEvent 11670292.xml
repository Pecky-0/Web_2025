Join me for a drink or two at Tavern in the Square.  We'll go to the Central Square location.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll email my cell phone # on Wednesday, October 28th around 4pm to the people who respond yes or maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll get there around 5:45pm / 6pm (ish) and stay for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no group tab.  Please maintain your own tab or pay as you go.  We'll hang out in the bar / lounge area.  There is no reservation.  People arrive and leave at various times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the red line to Central Sq.  There's also plenty of street parking and parking lots in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their website for directions, menu, etc:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.taverninthesquare.com/main.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.taverninth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my last happy hour as assistant organizer.  Starting next week, I will have too many commitments in the evenings, for several months, so I need to focus on that.  So, come on out to say bye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll email my cell phone # to the people who respond yes or maybe.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>2969721</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256940408000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256060275000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour at Tavern in the Sq (Central Square)</name><id>11670292</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256767200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/11670292/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/d/global_9267149.jpeg</photo_url></item>
