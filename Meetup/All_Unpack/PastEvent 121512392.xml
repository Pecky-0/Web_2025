&lt;p&gt;Carbuncle Pond-Moosup River is hike #21 in Ken Weber’s book “Weekend Walks in Rhode Island. The pond and most of the surrounding land is in the Nicholas Farm Wildlife Management Area. This area is close to the Connecticut state line, in Coventry, RI. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Our group hikes through Nicholas Farm during Section 6 of the NST. During the hike we will walk on woodland paths, old farm roads, through open fields, and along an abandoned railroad bed. A point of interest to check out during the hike is Spencer Rock pictured below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 The hike is a relatively short 3 miles, and should take 1.5 hours to complete. The land is mostly flat, with some small hills on the woodland trails. Wearing boots is recommended, as there may be wet sections along the trail. As always bring water &amp;amp; snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Follow Rt 14 or Rt 117 into western Coventry. Watch for signs for the Carbuncle Pond Fishing Area. This is about one mile west of the junction of Rt 14 &amp;amp; Rt 117. Follow the dirt entrance road until it comes to the pond. Park in the section of the parking lot close to the fishing pier.&lt;/p&gt;
