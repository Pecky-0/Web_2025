So Elaine and Francis have offered for us to meet at their house instead (still in Portland, a bit inland near Morrill's Corner...see address and map ablove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads up for May (a permaculture project in progress at one of our member's homes), June (Planning for Winter Harvesting ... at Dave Homa's in Gorham) and June (at Sue McCormick's place in South Portland).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have joined the group recently, our meetups during the outside months involve a potluck at someone's home, looking at their property and discussing their plans and wishes to move in a more &amp;quot;permculture&amp;quot; direction.  We often have a theme or topic for discussion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potluck breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;Last name starting with A-G bring main or side dish to share &lt;br /&gt;Last name starting with H-M bring salad or veg or dessert &lt;br /&gt;Last name starting with N-S bring whatever you want &lt;br /&gt;Last name starting with T-Z bring bread or beverage&lt;br /&gt;We'll rotate this list each month so won't be stuck in a rut:)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176417156000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171378152000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Portland Maine Permaculture Meetup</name><id>5477649</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176244200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/5477649/</event_url></item>
