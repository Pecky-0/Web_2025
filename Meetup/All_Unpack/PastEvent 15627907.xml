Described as “bite-size films” or “minute masterpieces,” (New York Times) these outstanding commercials in a range of categories offer a glimpse into the originality, wit, and creativity of British advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is NOTHING like US advertising....as most Brits will already know!) &lt;a href="http://www.icaboston.org/programs/film/brit-comm-2010/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get to see the great ICA Exhibits too....&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt; Let me know if you want to come earlier, as I probably will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to pay your own $10 admission fee for the commercials. I'm not sure if this includes admission to the exhibit halls also - but you might be able to get free ICA tickets from your local library for that.. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the foyer of the ICA at 2. 30.
