As part of the new green Cambridge Public Library’s Main Branch inaugural season, this special celebration will feature songs from their most recent critically acclaimed CD for adults, Cada Día un Regalo, selections from their bilingual Parents’ Choice Award-winning CD, El Doble de Amigos/Twice as Many Friends, and the unveiling of a new song from  “SABOR Y MEMORIA (Flavor and Memory): A Musical Feast in Seven Courses”, the group’s suite-in-progress about Latin food, identity, memory, immigration, slow food and hunger.  The suite was composed this past winter by guitarist/musical director Brian Amador, during a fellowship at the MacDowell Artist Colony in Peterborough, NH for Sol y Canto and string quartet, and begins touring nationally in February 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart and soul of Sol y Canto’s music is its lush vocal harmonies, sumptuous Spanish guitar and a combination of Latin rhythms and beautiful ballads performed with excitement and enthusiasm. Led by New Mexican guitarist/composer Brian Amador, along with Puerto Rican/Argentine singer/percussionist, Rosi Amador, and accompanied by top musicians from Panama, Uruguay, Perú and the U.S. Sol y Canto’s concerts have brought audiences to their feet from Symphony Hall, the Kennedy Center and White House to the Philadelphia Art Museum, the California World Music Festival, the Vancouver Folk Festival, and Puerto Rico’s Museo de Arte.
