The Romanian film, &lt;b&gt;4 months 3 Weeks and 2 Days&lt;/b&gt;,  is this year's model along with Persepolis ( only nominated for Best Animation Film and will probablly lose to  Disney's simplistic morality tale Ratatoiulle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been wondering when this film would finally make it to Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;b]4 months 3 Weeks and 2 Days&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  113 min. Romania&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, this unforgettable drama is so gripping it plays like a thriller. Set during the last year of the Ceau√ßescu dictatorship, ironically called the &amp;quot;Golden Age of Romania,&amp;quot; life has become a nightmare for the hard-pressed citizens. The film unfolds over 24 tense hours as a college student (Anamaria Marinca) desperately tries to arrange an illegal abortion for her irresponsible roommate (Laura Vasiliu). As almost everything that could possibly go wrong does, the film reveals how oppression infects every aspect of the culture. A political, moral and spiritual knockout.  Kendall Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As written and directed by Cristian Mungiu, &amp;quot;4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days&amp;quot; takes pains not to be flashy, not to do anything that, in the director's words, &amp;quot;could be seen as staged or conventional.&amp;quot; Instead, it conveys unblinking and despairing emotional truth with enough intensity to leave you gasping for air. &amp;quot;4 Months&amp;quot; is the latest in a series of films that have come from Romania that seem to herald a late-blooming cinematic renaissance there. These works, including &amp;quot;The Death of Mr. Lazarescu&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;12:08 East of Bucharest,&amp;quot; share a bleak worldview and a kinship with socially conscious pre-glasnost films made behind the Iron Curtain. L A Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabita is pregnant. Young, single, an ambitious student, and of limited means, she wants to have an abortion. Her friend Otilia vows to help her. In no time or place would this be easy to handle, but Gabita and Otilia live in Eighties Romania, where Nicolae Ceaucescu is in power. Every woman is required to serve the state by producing six children; abortion of any sort is illegal; and there are secret police everywhere. Eye for Film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't think of a film that has shown life in the eastern bloc more fiercely than this; without ever being overtly political, it makes you feel humanity itself being coarsened and degraded by the state. In recent memory, we've seen The Lives of Others and Good Bye Lenin!, which affected to be about the last days of European communism, and they have been very effective in their own differing ways, but outclassed and made to look lenient and inauthentic by this brutal masterwork.
