We have the room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It's comfortable and there is also a small private room that can hold 20+ adjacent to the lounge where we can have converstation.  This is also a great place to do a listening and intro for new artists releasing product locally.  We can do this early 8:00 - 10:00  or whatever really works for the group we are very flexible!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your favorite CDs, LPs or iPod with playlists. This is a great chance to be exposed to some new music and hear what others are listening to. If you have recordings of local Boston musicians, please bring them! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Green C line to the Washington Square T stop and walk 1/2 block along the south side of Beacon St. The E Room is in the Golden Temple restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.bostonjazz.net/events/bostonmusic.ics/listeningparty/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonjazz.net/events/bostonmusic.ics/listeningparty/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonjazz...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273539221000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonjazz</urlname><id>87187</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Jazz Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1109270750000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Jazz Listening Party at the E Room in Brookline</name><id>4302540</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1111539600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonjazz/events/4302540/</event_url></item>
