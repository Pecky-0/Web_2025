BK will be organizing this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 4:00 on Saturday and throw the ball around while getting to know each others' names. After warming up we'll get a game going! Check our &lt;a href="http://flagfootball.meetup.com/49/about"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt; page for a full list of game rules, group policies and rule modifications. At 6:30 or so we'll head over to UNO's to finish up with conversation over food/drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who take public transportation, the Harvard Bus and T Station is a couple blocks away (see the map).
