Bryan has passed the hosting baton to Debbie Smart (our Secretary) and she will be hosting our group's participation this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're announcing it early enough just in case you guys want to train for it. The run starts at 9:45am, but show up early to get your number (to be timed) and your t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration and info can be found here: &lt;a href="http://www.hartfordmarathon.com/Events/O_Niantic_5K.htm" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.hartfordmarathon.com/Events/O_Niantic_5K.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Pajama Program will have collection bins and volunteers on-site at the race to collect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;New&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, unused pajamas and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NEW&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;books for the children. Runners are invited to bring their donations the day of the race.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;Pajama Program is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization, providing new, warm pajamas and new books to children in need in the United States, many who are waiting and hoping to be adopted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;Thousands of children served live in orphanages, group homes and shelters and are shuffled often between temporary living facilities. Many of them have been abused or abandoned, and have never enjoyed the simple comfort of having a mother or father tuck them in at bedtime and read to them. Since 2001 with your help, they have provided more than 2,000,000 pajamas and books to children in need nationwide!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Debbie</member_name><member_id>8929559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363452050000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Atheist-Humanist-Society-of-CT-and-RI</urlname><id>1443202</id><group_lat>41.5499992371</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0299987793</group_lon><name>Atheist Humanist Society of CT and RI</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359041893000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>O'Niantic 5K Run</name><id>101170362</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363439700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Atheist-Humanist-Society-of-CT-and-RI/events/101170362/</event_url></item>
