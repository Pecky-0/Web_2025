We worked a schedule out with Sambar - a cozy restaurant in Newport with great food and drinks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday night is a great night for fun out in Newport and it won't interfere with Monday night football &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please sign up&lt;/b&gt; and/or send me a message if you are interested in Thursday Night Trivia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrive at 8PM and we are going to try an 8:30PM start time. It normally lasts between 1 1/2 - 2 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sambar is working on an advertising campaign to bring this night to life as well as offering prizes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking - Until October you have to follow what the signs say for parking in Newport. The last event our members found easy parking in the Ocean Breeze Cafe lot - less than two blocks after Sambar on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Lonnie or ask for Newport Friends Meetup Group and if you cannot find us - please call: 829-8516</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lonnie</member_name><member_id>6911660</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284733604000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284087302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Early Trivia - Sambar - Always an Adventure - it is going to be a fun night!</name><id>14719612</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284681600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/14719612/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/f/global_17999311.jpeg</photo_url></item>
