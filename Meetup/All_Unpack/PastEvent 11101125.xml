The world's richest man - Jerry Oilman - has invited anybody who is anybody to his birthday party - the biggest party of all time. Jerry Oilman is an extremely wealthy man. He also has the misfortune of being a very short man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He made his money in oil. He is eccentric and notorious for his collection of stuffed bats. These hideous black winged creatures hang from the walls and ceiling of his house spooking everyone who enters. Some people consider Jerry Oilman quite batty. Others are less polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight Jerry has invited a host of rich and famous people. For example, Marilyn Monroe is here looking for the perfect man. And when you get this many big names together you know there's sure to be conflict. What Jerry hadn't foreseen, and what you don't know, is that something sinister and frightening is about to take place. You will all be asked to work out who is the villain behind this dastardly crime - a crime that will take us all the way to the graveside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characters Needed!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred Astaire&lt;br /&gt;Ginger Rogers&lt;br /&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;br /&gt;Janis Joplin&lt;br /&gt;John Wayne&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;br /&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;br /&gt;Judy Garland&lt;br /&gt;Bruce Lee&lt;br /&gt;Rita Hayworth&lt;br /&gt;Groucho Marx&lt;br /&gt;Lucille Ball&lt;br /&gt;Bob Marley&lt;br /&gt;Patsy Cline&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256594990000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250136470000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Murder Mystery Party</name><id>11101125</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256421600000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Out-and-About-Group/events/11101125/</event_url></item>
