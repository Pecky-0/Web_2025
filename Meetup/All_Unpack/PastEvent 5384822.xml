See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett Zaccardi of Boston-based alternative marketing agency Street Attack (&lt;a href="http://www.streetattack.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.streetattack.com&lt;/a&gt;) will be speaking about the ways in which brands and ideas spread through online&lt;br /&gt;grassroots communities through viral and word of mouth messaging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett and Street Attack have worked with Red Bull, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Microsoft, Expedia, Dunlop, and other major brands.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&lt;br /&gt;will utilize real world examples and case studies to demonstrate how&lt;br /&gt;designers can fine-tune their skills to visually woo the social media&lt;br /&gt;landscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between MySpace, YouTube, the exploding blogosphere,&lt;br /&gt;Web 2.0, and the undeniable fascination with social media,&lt;br /&gt;marketing/advertising agencies and design firms with an understanding&lt;br /&gt;of online viral and word of mouth marketing are in high demand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ever, marketers and brands need to find ways to reach their&lt;br /&gt;audiences and spread their messages on the basis of just one of the&lt;br /&gt;five senses: sight. This means that graphic, web, and video designers&lt;br /&gt;hold a powerful position within the current online climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;We will start with&lt;br /&gt;mingling, food, &amp;amp; drinks from 6-6:30, presentation from 6:30-7:30,&lt;br /&gt;post-mingling from 7:30-whenever.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Fischer</member_name><member_id>3013881</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171062377000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New Haven Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NHDesignTech</urlname><id>283863</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Design &amp; Technology Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168517239000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grassroots and Viral Marketing, an Introduction</name><id>5384822</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170889200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NHDesignTech/events/5384822/</event_url></item>
