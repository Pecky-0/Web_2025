&lt;p&gt;Kelly and I would like to schedule a regular lore night at our place. As alliteration would have it, we'd like to do the third Thursday (thord Thorsday?) of every month. Ideally we'll try and pick a piece of lore (either a short tale, or a section of a specific saga, etc) with plenty of time for people to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for this lore night (insert edit now that we've decided on chapters) we're going to cover chapters 1-17 of the Saga of Burnt Njal.  For the March lore night we'll do chapters 18-51 (there are a lot of short 1-paragraph chapters).  See the comments below where Mike talks about what's in each section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So regardless, we'll host people at our place on the third Thursday of the month and we'll figure out food before then. We can always do pizza or takeout.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Schenkman</member_name><member_id>14202135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361499224000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Followers of Asatru</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>asatru-242</urlname><id>369297</id><group_lat>41.8600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut &amp; Western Mass Asatru Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359598793000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Lore Night at the Shire</name><id>102254702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361487600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/asatru-242/events/102254702/</event_url></item>
