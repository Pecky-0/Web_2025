&lt;p&gt;We're having another Movie Marathon! This time, the theme is Star Wars (because of it being May the Fourth) and Superheroes (because it is free comic book day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the afternoon session of the Movie Marathon where we will be focusing on Star Wars. We split the meetups so you could go to one if you couldn't make both. Please RSVP to both if you are going to both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked the screening room at the Somerville Theater on May 4th! We'll take a break in between the afternoon and the evening session to pick up dinner around Davis Square; we have the room from 2pm to 11pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because renting the screening room at the theater is not free, there is a charge to this meetup. All proceeds will go toward the renting of the room and expenses related to the meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to theater and they said we can bring in whatever we want as long as it isn't hard liquor. Beer, wine, and hard cider are served on the premise as well :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what we're showing in the Afternoon: &lt;br /&gt;

 2:15 to 3:45 Star Wars: A New Hope &lt;br /&gt;

 4:00 to 6:15 Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the microtheater down near the Museum of Bad Art.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn</member_name><member_id>9373103</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>9704391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1367855036000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365514287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Somerville Movie Marathon - Afternoon Session</name><id>113457762</id><headcount>31</headcount><duration>15300000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367690400000</time><rsvp_limit>31</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/113457762/</event_url></item>
