And the smells there are pretty good too  (this coming from a Beagle of course).    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact,  it was exactly a year ago that we had a meetup at Beaver Brook....so let's make this an annual event. &lt;br /&gt;We hope you will join us for what promises to be a lovely afternoon in a truly scenic area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunting is not allowed on the property,  however it is still advisable to wear orange in case any hunters disregard the posted signs.   It never hurts to be on the cautious side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dress in layers,  wear hat and gloves,  bring water for you and your dog (snacks couldn't hurt either) and don't forget your pooper bags.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also bring a leash .....just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/9/f/highres_11655775.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:  Beaver Brook Association,  at Maple Hill Farm&lt;br /&gt;When:   Saturday  December 5,  2009  at  High Noon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to the Beaver Brook Association if you would like to learn more about them.
