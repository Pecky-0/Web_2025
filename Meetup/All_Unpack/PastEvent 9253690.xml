We're also changing from potluck to ordering pizza.  Please plan on a $5 contribution to pizza.  If anyone is willing or able, beverages, appetizers, and desserts would be nice but not required.  Please indicate in your RSVP or with a note below if you will be bringing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Don and Sharon's home in Hebron.  Since it's a private home, you must RSVP for directions!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda</member_name><member_id>3403216</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232667123000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228094164000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a meeting</name><id>9253690</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232150400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/9253690/</event_url></item>
