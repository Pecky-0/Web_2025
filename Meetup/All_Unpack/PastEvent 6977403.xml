O'Connor, Ciar√°n Hinds, Dillion Freasier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genres: Period Film, Drama, Family Drama&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: The story chronicles the life and times of one Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), who transforms himself from a down-and-out silver miner raising a son on his own into a self-made oil tycoon. When Plainview gets a mysterious tip-off that there?s a little town out West where an ocean of oil is oozing out of the ground, he heads with his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), to take their chances in dust-worn Little Boston. In this hardscrabble town, where the main excitement centers around the holy roller church of charismatic preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), Plainview and H.W. make their lucky strike. But even as the well raises all of their fortunes, nothing will remain the same as conflicts escalate and every human value ? love, hope, community, belief, ambition and even the bond between father and son ? is imperiled by corruption, deception and the flow of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: N/A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailer: &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_vantage/therewillbeblood/hd/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.apple.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Please do not RSVP YES if you do not intend to come. Yes is not a &lt;b&gt;MAYBE&lt;/b&gt;. If you can't figure out what your going to do in the future, please do not burden us with that. Please buy your tix AHEAD of time! I'm going to watch this regardless of people coming, but it will more fun with people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is showing downstairs in auditorium#2, I'll be right behind the corded rope after ticket stubs have been ripped in front of the popcorn counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there @11:30PM, I'm only waiting until 11:45PM sharp and then I'm heading into the cinema. The movie begins @midnight. It's very likely we won't have a discussion afterwards... though there is a 24 hr diner near South Station if you are crazy enough =P.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I"ll be wearing my trademark green hat+Meetup logo+my screename JediFonger in front as usual.
