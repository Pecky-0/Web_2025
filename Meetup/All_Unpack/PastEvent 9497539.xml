The book is &amp;quot;The Sayings of Layman P'ang - A Zen Classic of China,&amp;quot; newly translated by James Green (2009 - Shambhala Publications, Inc. - paperback). These wise and funny stories have been an inspiration to spiritual practice for more than twelve centuries, particularly for all those who follow the Buddhist path as laypeople. Layman P'ang (740-808) was a merchant and family man who one day put all his money and possessions in a boat and sunk it in a river, so that he could devote his life to the study of the dharma. His family joined him in an itinerant life traveling from temple to monastery across southern China. This collection of anecdotes and verses about the enlightened layman and his family has become an enduring Zen classic. You are invited to add your experiences and understanding of Zen Buddhism to the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a small sign on a cafe table that says "Book Discussion"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aurore Eaton</member_name><member_id>3983123</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257074405000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People interested in Buddhism</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha</urlname><id>447070</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Manchester Buddhism Sangha</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231685064000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A discussion of "The Sayings of Layman P'ang - A Zen Classic of China"</name><id>9497539</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255388400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha/events/9497539/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/5/global_1946069.jpeg</photo_url></item>
