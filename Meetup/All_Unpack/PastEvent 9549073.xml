If YES, are you living it?  Many people have an idea of their purpose, but struggle to align their lives with it.  Others are still searching for the answer to the question, “Why am I here?”  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing your purpose can dramatically enhance your experience of life.  Purpose-driven people experience more fulfillment, more success, and often greater financial rewards than other people.  We all have a unique purpose that we have been training our whole lives to perform, whether we are aware of it or not.  &lt;b&gt;When the dreams we pursue in life are guided by our purpose, our vibrational escrow is magnified and we enter a state of “flow”.  From this state, magic happens and dreams manifest!  &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suzy Spivey, our charismatic BostonLOA member and a Certified Dream Coach™&lt;/b&gt;, will facilitate an &amp;quot;experential&amp;quot; discussion of a powerful process that she learnt from Tim Kelley.  Tim, author of &amp;quot;Wake Up and Live the Life You Love:  Living on Purpose&amp;quot;, developed a process to Know Your Purpose™.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using this process, we will:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    * delve into what it means to know and live your true purpose,&lt;br /&gt;    * use the Purpose Hunting™ exercise to begin to access our purpose &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;    * learn the 3 aspects of purpose to create your own purpose statement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For members who are clear on their true purpose, this material may help to confirm your alignment with your purpose and go deeper in understanding the various aspects of your purpose.  And most importantly, you can be of service to our community by sharing your purpose and discovery process!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to a “purposeful” meetup with lots of sharing and discovery! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you very much, Suzy, for your gift of time and facilitation!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Suzy Spivey&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzy Spivey brings passion, belief, and a wide range of life experience to her work as a Certified Dream Coach™, TV Host and Producer, and Inspirational Speaker.
