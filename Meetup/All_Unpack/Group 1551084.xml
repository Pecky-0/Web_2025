How do they make the most of each day and reach their potential? How do they 'take their foot off the brake'?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do some people acheive their goals while others seem to continue to struggle? Are you looking to surround yourself with people who are motivated, determined, and focused on achieving and exceeding, both personally and professionally? Our mission at 'Successful Anonymous' is to bring together like-minded people from around the Boston area, who share a desire to reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group environment will promote business networking, relationship-building, discussions, open forum, and much more. Business Networking allows individuals to align themselves with people who can help with the growth of their professional network. Often times this may appeal to entrepreneurs, though in reality, we 'Success Addicts' are able to help anyone and everyone work towards accomplishing their goals. We have been hosting our Meet Ups in Watertown at the Watertown Free Library, though we are open to suggestions for facilities in Cambridge, Newton, Brighton, or Boston. S.A. is focused on growth and development via networking, and we are always open to feedback from our members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback, questions, or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.85</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1257272234000</created><lat>42.3400001526</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>381</id><urlkey>entrepreneur</urlkey><name>Entrepreneur</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>389</id><urlkey>smallbiz</urlkey><name>Small Business</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3336</id><urlkey>self-improvement</urlkey><name>Self-Improvement</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>8649</id><urlkey>personalgrowth</urlkey><name>Personal Growth</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10117</id><urlkey>businessnetwork</urlkey><name>Business Strategy and Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15231</id><urlkey>young-professionals</urlkey><name>Young Professionals</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15236</id><urlkey>business-networking</urlkey><name>Business Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15405</id><urlkey>business-referral-networking</urlkey><name>Business Referral Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15720</id><urlkey>professional-networking</urlkey><name>Professional Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16144</id><urlkey>self-empowerment-exploration</urlkey><name>Self Empowerment &amp; Exploration</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17866</id><urlkey>meeting-new-people</urlkey><name>Meeting New People</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>19882</id><urlkey>entrepreneurship</urlkey><name>Entrepreneurship</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>20060</id><urlkey>business-entrepreneur-networking</urlkey><name>Business Entrepreneur Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>21681</id><urlkey>startup-businesses</urlkey><name>Startup Businesses</name></topics_item></topics><name>Successful Anonymous</name><id>1551084</id><members>391</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>72707692</member_id><name>Ruben B.
