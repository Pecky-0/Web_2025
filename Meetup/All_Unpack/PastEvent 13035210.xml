<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The last few weeks (when we haven't had the conference room) it has been really crowded at Borders, so I am going to South Station food court tonight at 6 (upstairs from the food) to check it out.  Maybe if some people go to each site we will solve the crowding problem.  I will not stick around past 630 if no one RSVPs or shows by then.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suzanne</member_name><member_id>1732576</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270159560000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269949951000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesday meetup experiment - South Station</name><id>13035210</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269986400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/13035210/</event_url></item>
