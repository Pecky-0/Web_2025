This run at the Capitol Theatre in Arlington may be our last chance to see it on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-street parking is not metered in Arlington, and parking on Massachusetts Avenue is relatively easy. The #77 bus to Arlington Heights originates in Harvard Square on the Red Line and stops right across the street from the theater. (I think the bus stop is called Lake Street.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Grit shows at 7:30. I'll buy my ticket between 7:00 and 7:10 p.m. and then wait about 10 or 15 minutes (until 7:25 at the latest) in the theater lobby across from the concession stand. The lobby is pretty small; I don't think you'll&amp;nbsp; have any problem finding me and my bright red backpack. I will be in the theater auditorium in time to see the previews; you can find me after the movie watching the movie credits, then in front of the theater&amp;nbsp;if you're late. Arlington isn't known for its nightlife, but maybe one of the restaurants on the same block as the theater will still be open after the movie. We'll check and see if people want to go out after the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the theater's website at &lt;a href="http://somervilletheatreonline.com/capitol-theatre/"&gt;http://somervilletheatreonline.com/capitol-theatre/&lt;/a&gt; -- the Capitol Theatre and the Somerville Theatre are owned by the same company, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the Capitol!&lt;/p&gt;
