part of its summer lunchtime film series. It is free and open to
the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just couldn't resist this one: I actually own some Tupperware
(that certifies my Nerd&amp;nbsp;status right there). &amp;#65279;Think of
this movie as a bit of Americana, a bit of American history, a
little bit about women's rights. Tupperware&amp;nbsp;was invented in
Leominster, Massachusetts, in 1946, part of the postwar consumer
boom. The woman who made it and its marketing technique famous was
Brownie Wise. Her first job was selling Stanley Home Products, once
headquartered in Westfield, Massachusetts; one of the Stanley
Home&amp;nbsp;Products divisions is still located there. (The pond on
the company's grounds was once home to a pair of attack-swans, but
that's another&amp;nbsp;story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what the Harvard Food Literacy Project had to say about
TUPPERWARE! via e-mail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*****TUPPERWARE! takes us back to the 1950s where we
  discover the remarkable story of a woman who's been erased from
  history&amp;nbsp;and meet the women she taught to move up in the
  world without leaving their homes. Rare archival footage and
  fabulously funny stories are interwoven in the thought-provoking
  tale of Brownie Wise, the self-taught saleswoman who built an
  empire out of bowls that burped. Featured in magazines and
  newspapers, she was the first woman ever on the cover of 
  &lt;em&gt;Business Week&lt;/em&gt;. Yet no one knows her name. TUPPERWARE!
  traces the dramatic story of Brownie Wise's rise from a
  hardscrabble Southern childhood to her spectacular fall in the
  glare of the national press. 63 minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;All films will be screened on Fridays at lunchtime (12
  noon to 1 p.m.) in Dana Palmer House (16 Quincy Street), Room
  102. Bring your lunch. Appropriately themed snacks will be
  provided.*****&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what&amp;nbsp;"appropriately themed snacks" means for
a movie about Tupperware. You can bring your lunch to this movie,
or we can go out&amp;nbsp;in Harvard Square after the movie if that's
what people would like to do. The movie is just over one hour
long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I have never been to the Dana Palmer House or to a movie
event hosted by the Harvard Food Literacy project, I will make sure
to arrive early. My plan is to arrive between 11:30 and 11:45 a.m.
I'll be carrying my bright red backpack 
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a meetup sign. (If you want to talk to other people
carrying bright red backpacks but no meetup sign, that's perfectly
fine!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for me after the movie. I'll try to gather everyone, and
then we can decide if we would like to go out for something in
Harvard Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the Dana Palmer House!&lt;/p&gt;
