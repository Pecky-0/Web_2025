Well they're back!  At least two thirds of the way back...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may recall that Morphine's frontman, Mark Sandman, died of a heart attack on stage in July 1999.  Since then, the other original band members have worked on various projects.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, they have joined forces with slide guitarist/vocalist Jeremy Lyons to form a new band called  &amp;quot;The Elastic Waste Band&amp;quot;.  Jeremy plays an array of one-of-a-kind electric guitars and even a version of Sandman's distinctive 2-string slide bass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to a slew of cool new material, the band plays a number of Morphine's best tunes - and they really kick 'em too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were a fan of Morphine, this is a trip back in time to one of the great bands of the Boston music scene. If you've never heard of Morphine, you're in for a sonic treat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there. (This is a joint meetup with Fun with Alcohol.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>i look like my profile picture and i'll email my cell number wednesday evening at about 6 p.m.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262401893000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262009107000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Members of Morphine @ Atwoods Tavern</name><id>12158525</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262228400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/12158525/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/4/7/global_12082679.jpeg</photo_url></item>
