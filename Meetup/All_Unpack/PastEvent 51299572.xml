&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showtime is 6, I will be at the theater by 5, we will head in for seats by 5:30.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie is showing upstairs, so look for me at the tables by the windows at the top of the escalator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a good idea to buy your tickets ahead of time.&amp;nbsp; The last couple of movies we did as a group were sold out. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after and bring cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Plot Summary:&lt;/span&gt; An unprecedented blend of real-life heroism and original filmmaking, "Act of Valor" stars a group of active-duty Navy SEALs in a powerful story of contemporary global anti-terrorism. Inspired by true events, the film combines stunning combat sequences, up-to-the minute battlefield technology and heart-pumping emotion for the ultimate action adventure. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 "Act of Valor" takes audiences deep into the secretive world of the most elite, highly trained group of warriors in the modern world. When the rescue of a kidnapped CIA operative leads to the discovery of a deadly terrorist plot against the U.S., a team of SEALs is dispatched on a worldwide manhunt. As the valiant men of Bandito Platoon race to stop a coordinated attack that could kill and wound thousands of American civilians, they must balance their commitment to country, team and their families back home. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Each time they accomplish their mission, a new piece of intelligence reveals another shocking twist to the deadly terror plot, which stretches from Chechnya to the Philippines and from Ukraine to Somalia. The widening operation sends the SEALs across the globe as they track the terrorist ring to the U.S.-Mexico border, where they engage in an epic firefight with an outcome that has potentially unimaginable consequences for the future of America.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
