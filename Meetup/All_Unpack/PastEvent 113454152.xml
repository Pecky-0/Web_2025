<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Beginning on May 6, we will begin a new Living in Your Heart gathering. This gathering is designed to help you achieve oneness with the spirit of all things. To hear what others have to say about their experiences, including young people, go to www.placeoflight.net/testimonies page and listen to the video and read the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gathering is by far the most important work done at APOL. Space is limited, so please let us know if you are serious about this spiritual journey. We do not teach what to be, but rather create a space where you can discover what you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee is either $35 a class or prepay for four classes for $85 with no credit for missed classes.  The class is ongoing for as long as you wish to attend.  It does not matter if you are just interested in what it means to be intuitive or if you are already aware and using your abilities, this gathering will be of value to you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367936555000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365512294000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living in Your Heart gathering</name><id>113454152</id><duration>5400000</duration><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367879400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/113454152/</event_url></item>
