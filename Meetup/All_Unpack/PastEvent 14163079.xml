Have no fear! Here is your chance!  This is the slowest ride we do all year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join as we travel through Rhode Island's most beautiful bike path on Saturday at 9:15 AM.  Ride by water, greenery and scenic mills, all while in the company of one of the state's most famous bicyclists (me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an ice cream shop there, so you may want to bring a few dollars with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blackstone River Bikeway is 10 miles of paved bike path from Lincoln through Valley Falls Heritage Park in Cumberland and ends in Woonsocket at the Water Treatment Plant on Manville Hill Road. We often stop at the end of the path for ice cream, before turning around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at The Blackstone River State Park, Front Street, Lincoln. To find us: pull into the address listed above, go down the road for maybe a mile and we'll be at the first parking lot on your right.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a guy on a red bike with a red car or try my cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281884655000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279668262000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BIKING the Blackstone on Saturday!
