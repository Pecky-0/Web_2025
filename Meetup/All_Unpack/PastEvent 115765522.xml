&lt;p&gt;There is another hike I would like to do Sunday. But, I have had some many people ask me to do this event again. This looks to be for me, one of the only times, I can do this for sometime. I put an order in for a sunny and warm day.  So, &lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/6/event_228298902.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;please bring your the dogs, the kids, your friends, and join Steve Ob1. and his friends. This is an easy 2 to 3 hour hike through 170 acres, and up the wooded trails of Andreas' Sculpture Park. Art work from sculptors from around the world, all along the trails. At the top of the trails is a spot with seats, and a view of Mt. Manadnock, 75 miles away. There, we will sit, have our picnic and watch the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can not make it at 11:00 am? Than meet us at anytime along the trail. The trail crisscrosses the main driveway to the top and the art studio. We park below at the start of the paved driveway. Please do not drive up the driveway.  Steve Ob1. will have his Ceil phone on to help you find us. Please dress for changing weather and the woods. Remember the Deer Ticks are very bad this year. So, check yourself after being in the woods. Bring your own bugs spray, your own drinks and food. This is privet property. So, what we bring into the park. We must bring out. Dog owner, please pick up after your dog.&lt;/p&gt;
