The Luxury Box has an extensive hot and cold appetizer menu (over 30 appetizer options!). Try their nachos, potato skins, maple chipotle grilled shrimp or mini crab cakes. They also offer a large choice of salads, panini, char grilled pizzas, and burgers. Bring your appetite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a description of the book by an Amazon reviewer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Help is about a young white woman in the early 1960s in Mississippi who becomes interested in the plight of the black ladies' maids that every family has working for them. She writes their stories about mistreatment, abuse and heartbreaks of working in white families' homes, all just before the Civil Rights revolution. That is the story in a nutshell - but it is so much more than just stories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best book I have read in years! I can't recommend it enough! It is fabulous and I think they will make a movie out of it. I would compare it to the writings of Carson McCullers, Harper Lee, Truman Capote and even Margaret Mitchell. The story grabs you and doesn't let you go. You can smell the melted tar on the Mississippi roads, the toil in the cotton fields, the grits burning on the stove. The theme is the indomitable will of human beings to survive against all odds - because of the color of their skin. The pure, down and out bitchery of the white ladies who become dissatisfied with their maids and proceed to ruin their lives is portrayed vividly. I have laughed and cried my way through this book and plan to re-read it. I highly recommend this book because it is going to be talked about as the best book of the year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservations will be under "Heather" or "Book Club". </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather M</member_name><member_id>2005368</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275133248000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>literary critics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Reading-Sharing-and-Laughing</urlname><id>1551608</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Reading, Sharing and Laughing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271887586000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book Discussion - The Help by Kathryn Stockett</name><id>13252247</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275001200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Reading-Sharing-and-Laughing/events/13252247/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/1/global_11643361.jpeg</photo_url></item>
