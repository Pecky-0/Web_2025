Sandra and Ross have been playing music together for 8 years and are now taking their duo on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching into their individual roots of Classical Western, Bluegrass, Jazz, Scandinavian, Middle-eastern, Old-time American music and more, their arrangements honor each tradition while moving into new, unchartered territory. Whether itâ€™s old-time tunes in 7, Bach on nyckelharpa and guitar, Swedish tunes from hundreds of years ago brought into a 21st century arrangement, original compositions or simply beautifully played renditions of traditional folk melodies from around the world; Sandra and Ross create a musical playground for everyone (both musicians and listeners) to explore, play, stretch, and grow in a joyful space.&lt;/p&gt;
