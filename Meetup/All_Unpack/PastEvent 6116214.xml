Here's a description from their website:  Alice Neel&lt;br /&gt;This new feature-length documentary tells the story of American painter Alice Neel (1900-1984). Exploring the struggles Alice Neel faced as a woman, a single mother and a painter who defied conventions, the film uses a mix of old family photographs, historical footage and newly filmed interviews. With an appearance by the filmmaker, Andrew Neel, Alice Neel?s grandson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't been to the museum yet, here's a link to their website for directions and other info:  &lt;a href="http://www.icaboston.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.icaboston....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here's a link to a review in the NY Times that another member thoughtfully included in her message on our web site message board.  &lt;a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/movies/20alic.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://movies2.nytime...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a cafe at the museum where we can enjoy a discussion afterwards.
