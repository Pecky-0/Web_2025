It is recommended that you wear hiking boots and bring bug spray, suntan lotion and plenty of liquids to keep hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Beaver Brook:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beaver Brook Association was founded by Hollis P. Nichols and Jeffrey P. Smith, both of Hollis, New Hampshire. Beginning with just 12 acres of land in 1964, the two cousins dedicated their time and energies to creating a special land-based resource for young and old alike, a place that both fostered land stewardship awareness and encouraged a sense of appreciation for the natural world. During this time, the State of New Hampshire chartered Beaver Brook Association as an educational non-profit organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beaver Brook Today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the continued support and generosity of hundreds of caring individuals over the years, Beaver Brook's original 18 acres has blossomed into over 2,000 acres located in Hollis, Brookline, and Milford, New Hampshire! To continue the vision that Hollis and Jeff started in 1964, BBA now relies on a combination of program fees, revenue from land management practices, and donations to help achieve our mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking, biking, horseback riding, bird watching, and many other activities are enjoyed daily on the nearly 35 miles of trails at BBA. Each trail has been carefully mapped and designated for activities that will have the least impact on that particular area. Trails are open from dawn until dusk, seven days a week. Color-coded maps are available for $2.00 at the office.
