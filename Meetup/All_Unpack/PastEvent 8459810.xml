Drum Circles are a great way to stay connected to our inner rhythms. You'll learn some new rhythms, get some technique help and meet some great people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback from this Summer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Had a wonderful time.... The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ‚Äù Irene&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will welcome you into the circle</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219019003000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217655161000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Drum Circle on the Banks of the River Charles</name><id>8459810</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218839400000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DrumConnection/events/8459810/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/5/global_2830581.jpeg</photo_url></item>
