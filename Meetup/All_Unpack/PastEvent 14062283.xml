(This Meetup is tentative, pending weather forecasts later in the week.  We'll shoot for the first viable Sat. afternoon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven't been, Dugger Park (five courts) is not far from the Tufts courts and you can Google Map the address above for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If attending, please RSVP and specify a best guess at your level -- e.g., &amp;quot;absolute beginner,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;beginner,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;advanced beginner&amp;quot; -- in your RSVP comment.  This'll give me a rough idea of how many courts we'll need and how I might be able to group people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you can't make it this particular w/end but would be interested in this kind of Meetup in the future, please RSVP No and indicate your interest w/ an RSVP comment so I can gauge the overall interest level.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"Ask for Dave; look for a guy w/ glasses and a right knee pad."</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave M.</member_name><member_id>7526742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279486113000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278794589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beginners/Adv.
