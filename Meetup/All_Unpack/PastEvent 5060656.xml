This time we are taking the party to the roof deck of the Black Rhino a Financial district hotspot. The weather is looking to be around 75-80  degrees sunny, a sharp contrast from the weather we have been having the last two weeks, so come and have a few cocktails with the group as we gear up for another festive weekend! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Details: We will meet on the roof deck (hence the title). If by chance there is rain we will meet on the first level. This place is packed on Thurs nites so I highly  ENCOURAGE you to attend early as possible. My picture is on the site under the Assistant Organizer section  so I should not be hard to find. My phone is 617-671-5310. Please make note prior to arriving. &lt;br /&gt;See you there ! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Transportation: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Line to Government Center&lt;br /&gt;Blue Line to  State Street/Aquarium &lt;br /&gt;Orange Line to State Street/Haymarket. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://http://www.theblackrhino.com/welcome.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://http://www.theblackrhino.com/welcome.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://http://www.the...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie - Nightlife Organizer</member_name><member_id>2175480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Night Life Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-nightlife</urlname><id>111392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Night Life Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1154659512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Bash on the Roof Deck Afterwork Mixer</name><id>5060656</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155248100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-nightlife/events/5060656/</event_url></item>
