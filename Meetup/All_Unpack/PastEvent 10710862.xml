The 1/4 th of the trail I have hiked so far leading to the lower falls is very scenic.  Although the ground is rough in places it's nothing that can't be relatively easily navigated by simply watching where you put your feet.  Although not necessary hiking poles could help with that.   As the trail follows the stream we could have some cars parked at both ends of the trail (unless people really feel up to doing a 6 mile round trip hike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The section of brook we will be hiking on runs through the towns of Lyndeborough, Mont Vernon, and Milford.  We will start near the lower falls and head upstream towards the upper falls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parking lot we will start at if coming from Fitch's Corner where Purgatory Rd starts is 0.4 miles and is on the left.   There is a sign for both McLellan Trail and Purgatory Brook Trail there (see pictures).  The actuall address I used is a house (duplex) just a bit past the parking lot on the right side of the road.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a group of dogs and white suzuki grand vitara - License plate- DOGPARK.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247182908000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245708558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Purgatory Brook Trail - 3 Waterfalls</name><id>10710862</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246806000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10710862/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/1/global_9300513.jpeg</photo_url></item>
