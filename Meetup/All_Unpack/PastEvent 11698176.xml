Our evening will be entitled &amp;quot;Two Views of John Dewey on his 150th Birthday.&amp;quot;  This will be an opportunity to not only think about humanism's past, but also consider its future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Public are invited to attend and admission is free. However, feel free to make a donation at the door or even join Greater Worcester Humanists! Membership is currently $30 per year. Please see Don Guyton for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the formal meeting will start at 7 p.m., but doors will open at 6:30 for anyone who wants to come early and socialize.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266786978000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256349797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>GWH November Meeting - Two Views of John Dewey on his 150th Birthday</name><id>11698176</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257897600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/11698176/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/4/7/global_11494935.jpeg</photo_url></item>
