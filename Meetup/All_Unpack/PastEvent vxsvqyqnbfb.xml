&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local investors, Alex and Kathy Schuck have been New England REIA members for years and are currently Mastermind coaches for Real Estate.  We asked them to come in and share what works and maybe some "lessons learned" through their experience and they are excited to come share with the group their ideas on REHABBING 101.  They will talk about Rehabbing properties from start to finish. The will present two rehab case studies to illustrate this process and show people how they marketed to find the deals, how they financed the deals, the rehab phase including unexpected problems they encountered, and how they marketed and sold the properties.  If Rehabbing is something you an't learn enough about, don't miss this insider meeting where some of our favorite members share their secrets to get your started on the right foot or back in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will we cover?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex and Kathy Schuck founded North Shore Real Estate Solutions, LLC located in Andover, Massachusetts in 2009.  Their company has bought, rehabbed, and sold many single family houses in the northeast Midddlesex county and southern Essex county areas. They have bought houses going through:  short sale, pre-foreclosure, probate, and bankruptcy processes; through estate sales, REO properties, and physically distressed properties.  They have experienced everything from mold remediation to rebuilding foundations.  And they have used a number of different ways to finance their deals; from self-directed IRAs, hard money loans, and commercial bank loans to name a few. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Both Alex and Kathy have been guest hosts on a real estate talk show on WBIX, a Boston radio station.  They are also “Mastery Coaches” with the Fortune Builders® company where they mentor students who want to become real estate investors.  Alex and Kathy can show couples how to build and effectively run a real estate business together…..without getting divorced (two words:  separate offices)!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
