Join us for a fun filled  Sunday afternoon of great food, live entertainment, casual atmosphere and plenty of &lt;span style="color: limegreen"&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Irish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; music and &lt;span style="color: limegreen"&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;green beer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Bills &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; accept reservations but can accommodate a large crowd. In fact, this place draws such a crowd for St. Patrick's Day weekend that they put up a heated tent with additional tables.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can't guarantee tables inside near the band, I post this meetup as a suggestion, FYI etc..... and not one of our usual meetup events.  I plan to be there with some friends and family and as always the more the merrier. But this is one case where everyone fends for themselves... That being said, &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;TRUST&lt;/span&gt; me its worth checking out !! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music is from 4-7 :30pm but my advice is to get there early to grab a table. Parking can be a little tricky so carpooling is also suggested.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit the website for more details and directions..... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.billsseafood.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.billsseafo...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlene</member_name><member_id>9052085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268764431000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267666300000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre - Saint Patrick's Day Celebration </name><id>12776366</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268591400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/12776366/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
