Rest assured, I haven't' forgotten about you all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to keep the Weekly Sunday Climbs in place at Metro Rock for the time being. It's a great way to make it so that everyone interested can come and get as much climbing as they want in before they go home. For outdoor type stuff, I'll probably be setting something up for Saturdays when it is nice. I'll make a post in the message board on how I will be managing the outdoor events. Hopefully it should be typed out and available to read by the end of the day (5/24)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't climbed with us before, you can look for me (Mike). I am 6'4&amp;quot; and I will be wearing a t-shirt and tan shorts. If you would like my cell number in case you don't think you will be able to find me, please send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great week everyone!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180482261000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1180035731000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Sunday Climb</name><id>5814709</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180278000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/5814709/</event_url></item>
