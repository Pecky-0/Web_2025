An irrepressible &amp;ldquo;Everyman&amp;rdquo; who asks tough questions, but offers no easy answers, he takes the audience to places it has never been before, and presents even familiar phenomena in completely new and different ways.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color : #333333"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;All donations support the Institute of HeartMath, an internationally recognized nonprofit research and education organization dedicated to helping people reduce stress, self-regulate emotions and build energy and resilience for healthy, happy lives&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327861080000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326489138000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie January - I AM</name><id>47997472</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327795200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/47997472/</event_url></item>
