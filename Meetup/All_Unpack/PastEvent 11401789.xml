However, there was an issue with Stuart's clubhouse.  We will now be meeting at Damata's in Salem.  Hopefully this will not affect your plans too much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Damata's the food is great, as are the prices. (We do request at Meetups held at service venues that each person attending at least order one item: food or beverage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also plenty of free parking. Should you be coming from outside of Salem, just remember that Damata's is on Bridge St., not the Bridge St. Bypass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your favorite board game to play.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253570924000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253235869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Board Games</name><id>11401789</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253376000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/11401789/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/8/9/global_3094489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
