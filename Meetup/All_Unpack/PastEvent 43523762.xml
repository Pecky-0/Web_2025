&lt;p&gt;Please try and use your GPS or print Map Quest directions prior for WYC.&amp;nbsp; Winthrop can be a confusing town to find your way around in.&amp;nbsp; Once you arrive at WYC, on your right on the water, go past it about 50 yards there is a large common parking lot past it to your right.&amp;nbsp; When you get to the front door (up the stairs) there is a door-bell to your right about shoulder level.&amp;nbsp; Our bartender will buzz you in.&amp;nbsp; Once inside our group will not be hard to find, we will be the majority of those there, otherwise ask the bartender where Bill Scanlon's group is.&amp;nbsp; We look forward to seeing you.&amp;nbsp; I am estimating 30+ people will be there!&amp;nbsp; Don't worry about the weather, its only going to rain for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

Wow, how time flies, another 2 years gone by. As Vice &amp;amp; then Commodore of WYC I had to fore-go this event the past 2 years. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

As busy as we all are, I ask you to make time for another MassBaySailors get together. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This is an open invitation to all MassBaySailors, their guests and any area sailing enthusiasts. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Planning is underway for the Fith Annual MassBaySailors Winter Solstice Holiday Party. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Yup, the 5th. In 2005 we had 19 people attend an evening of dinner and drinks at Ironside&amp;rsquo;s Grill in Charlestown . &lt;br /&gt;

The next 3 years we had 20 to 30 people attend each time at WYC. I hope we can get everyone back again this year! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Each year we&amp;rsquo;ve had an optional Yankee Swap (with a nautical gift theme) which turns out to be pretty fun. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This year it&amp;rsquo;ll again be held at WYC, you can&amp;rsquo;t beat FREE. I&amp;rsquo;m coordinating with our Bar Manager to insure we have adequate accommodations. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a cash bar with our full Pub Menu. WYC has a new Chef/Cook &amp;ldquo;Tony&amp;rdquo; who is doing a great job with new menu items! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We'll play some music, do a Yankee Swap (with a nautical gift theme in the $20 to $25 range) and maybe even a photo/video presentation. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I'll work on getting a guest speaker. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please understand that the most important element of this event will be us all getting together to celebrate the shortest day of the year, sharing some Holiday enthusiasm and rounding the mark towards next season.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Winthrop Yacht Club 649 Shirley Street, Winthrop , MA 02152</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>BillS</member_name><member_id>2822960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324669235000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323140465000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Fifth Annual MassBaySailors Winter Solstice Holiday Party!</name><id>43523762</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324512000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/43523762/</event_url></item>
