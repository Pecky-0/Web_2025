He's gotten the ok to hike and play so I thought why not where he loves to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is at the end of a street near the trail head (Hickory Hill Drive) so it looks like about 10 cars can squeeze in ok. There have been about 4 or so there already when we've gone the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the trail head entrance on Hickory Hill Drive:  When heading north towards Manchester, on Mammoth Road, take a left onto Shasta Drive (a country store with a Dunkin Donuts sign is right there).  Stay on Shasta until it ends (about 1.2 miles) and take a left onto High Range Road.  Stay on only short time, (about .3 miles) and take first street on right - Hickory Hill Drive.  Go to the end of it and park .... trail head is right in front of where parking is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can meet a little ways away from parking - under the power lines - so the dogs don't interfere with others.  The power lines are right before you get into the woods.  Snow shoes or yax trax or stabilicers would be helpful as the thaw and refreeze has caused some ice patches and hard snow.  There are some hills along the hikes and a few different trails to choose from on the way.  We can go for as short or long as you want.... Maybe an hour or so would be good depending on the weather? There are no bathrooms unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau and I hope to see some of you there. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265765274000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265041414000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Londonderry Musquash Conservation</name><id>12483622</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265472000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/12483622/</event_url></item>
