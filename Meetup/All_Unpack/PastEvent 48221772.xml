This is the same event that was formerly known as the "Backcountry Ski Workshop". It's still a backcountry ski workshop - but this year we're welcoming alpine skiers, snowboarders, and anyone else who wants to play in the snow in the beautiful setting of the AMC's Cardigan Lodge. For more details see &lt;a href="http://amcboston.org/ski/cardigan2012.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://amcboston.org/...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join skiers of all types and abilities to explore the diverse terrain of Mt. Cardigan! Instruction on the practice hill in small groups based on interest/ability - from beginner XC to advanced tele - then head into the backcountry for mellow cruising or challenging steeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not interested in Backcountry Skiing? No matter - you can get to several downhill and cross-country ski areas (Ragged, Waterville Valley, Cannon) in about an hour. The Cardigan Lodge is a beautiful backcountry lodge located in Alexandria, NH. It's a great place to relax after a day of skiing, and we'll have evening programs of various types (gear, backcountry info) to inform and entertain you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$185 members, $195 non-members, includes two nights at AMC's Cardigan Lodge and meals.
