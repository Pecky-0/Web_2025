We try to block the hurtful feelings and memories out of our awareness. But these feelings and experiences remain trapped within our body and mind. We then give off a vibe that causes us to attract and become attracted to dysfunctional people who create even more confusion, pain and suffering in our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn to “digest” the emotional baggage that keeps you trapped in unfulfilling relationships. Transform the deep seated patterns that cause you to attract people who are negative or abusive or who do not have the capacity to truly love you and be present with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heal the loss of past loves. Heal the shame and the feelings unworthiness, rejection and abandonment. Become clearer about what you really want in life and in a companion. You will naturally attract and find yourself attracted to healthier people as you heal the wounded parts of yourself. More and more love will flow to you as you begin to experience true love and acceptance for yourself. Working with these practices will make it possible for you to cultivate inner beauty and to develop a presence that is very healing to others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Develop the Kind of Warm Magnetic Presence That Will Attract a Healthy and Loving Partner&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many of us have learned to disconnect from our emotions and are not very present within our bodies. The stresses, emotions and life experiences that we fail to digest accumulate within our body and mind. These stagnant energies and emotions can extinguish our inner fire and passion. Stagnant energies decrease our desirability which makes us less attractive to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A body that if full of vital life force is infinitely more desirable. Become powerfully present while remaining centered within the core of your being. Exude warmth, passion, sensuality and desire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Develop Your Intuition and Sensory Awareness&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heightened intuition and sensory awareness lets us know when it is safe for us to open up to another person. It helps us to understand where people are coming from. Our intuition also guides us to the people that we are meant to be with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use Your Relationships to Evolve Spiritually&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Healing the hurts and resolving the issues awakens the part of the soul that resides within your body. Awakening your body-mind will enable you to develop a stronger connection with your higher self and the universal consciousness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Develop Chi Power&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many systems of Chinese martial arts emphasize the development of the dan tien, which is our base of power in the lower abdomen. You will learn specific chi gong practices that will enable you to continually cultivate the chi/shakthi in the dan tien. Developing Chi Power enables you to create a powerful magnetic presence that draws others to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create Healthier and More Fulfilling Relationships&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relationships have a way of bringing our core issues to the surface. Buried emotions and unresolved issues create barriers between ourselves and others. Our love grows stronger and our understanding deepens as we learn to “digest” our emotions, resolve important issues and express our feelings and needs in a healthy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*These classes may be recorded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This class is about healing our losses and cultivating the inner beauty that will enable us to attract the right kind of partner and create healthier relationships.
