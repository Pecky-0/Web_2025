The flowing movements release tension and negativity resulting in a sense of healing and wholeness. Based on the Chinese philosophy of Taoism that dates back over 6,000 years, the discipline of Tai-chi means â€œthe Grand Ultimate Way of Life as taught through movement.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start class by practicing Qi Gong exercises that move Chi through the meridians of our bodies. Then we will move into practicing the long form of Yang Style Tai Chi. As a healing art, Tai Chi builds a stamina and strength of being often lost in our hectic, modern-day society. Tai Chi rebalances vital energy, alleviating many stress-related symptoms, such as headaches, body pain, insomnia, high blood pressure, irritability, depression, and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All levels of experience are welcome. Come to learn these ancient Chinese arts that will allow you to feel good and enjoy life. With regular practice a person starts living with the peaceful spirit of Tai Chi, and is able to flow with any challenges or crises life may bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tai Chi movement is fluid, relaxed, and peaceful. Feelings and senses are alert. You are present in the moment, fully focused on the movements of your body and on your breathing. Your body becomes a current that is flowing with energy, vitality, and strength. Your body feels as if it were a tree, with roots planted in the earth, receiving light and air from the heavens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This class will be held the 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month at the Growing Green Wellness Center. For February it will be the 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month. Please note the change of dates. A $5 donation goes to support the healing arts space and community.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erik  harris</member_name><member_id>10967674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266847956000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265410881000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tai Chi- Healing through movement </name><id>12531444</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266674400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/12531444/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/a/global_11136970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
