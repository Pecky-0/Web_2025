The temperature might drop in the next few weeks, but if you're willing to bring a couple of layers, let's go another round of walking and talking and breathing delicious fall air at West Rock! Put on a pair of gloves, and join us for a &lt;b&gt;Sunday afternoon&lt;/b&gt; walk, before the Holidays start to take over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at West Rock, which is a Connecticut State Park located in New Haven and Hamden.  There are various entrances to the park, but we will be parking at Lake Wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  West Rock offers various levels of hiking, as it is a very large park.  However, this Meetup will be manageable for any hiker. We will walk through the woods on level ground, and avoid rocky or steep terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the Lake Wintergreen entrance, which is located on Main Street, between 12:45 and 1:00, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by 1:15. This hike will take 2 hours.  We will walk around the lake, because it is pretty, and the view of the water will fill the void where the foliage is dropping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING:  A bottle of WATER! (And a snack if you like.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Sneakers will suffice for this one.  &lt;b&gt;LAYERS.&lt;/b&gt; A hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.  Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Directions will be emailed to all who RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is no fee for parking in the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325276" target="_blank"&gt;Park website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Wintergreen+Ave+%26+Main+St,+CT+06514&amp;amp;sll=41.313428,-72.916724&amp;amp;sspn=0.007962,0.019312&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.35998,-72.962222&amp;amp;spn=0.007956,0.019312&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;g=Wintergreen+Ave+%26+Main+St,+CT+06514&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;iwstate1=saveplace" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map - Approximate Location of Park Entrance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing a red fleece and a winter hat.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228059231000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225942180000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Hikers' Low-pressure Sunday Afternoon Walk</name><id>9103960</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227463200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/9103960/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/e/global_6212542.jpeg</photo_url></item>
