The mechanics are fast, simple, and include rich opportunities for player narration.  We'll whip up a franchise, conduct a brief interview process to hire the PCs, and then tackle our first client and whatever problem he/she/it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Because it's not just a vampiric infestation, it's YOUR vampiric infestation!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the November installment of our series of one-shot indie RPG experiences to be offered monthly over the course of 2010.  Each month will feature a different GM running a new game.  This month's GM is Tresi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a game on your shelf that you've been itching to run, but your regular group just isn't interested?  Why not run it for us at the Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston!  We want to continue running one-shot games into 2011, and you can help!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the table with the complementary marshmellows.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tewhill</member_name><member_id>3431516</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1289730719000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288224328000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November One-Shot - InSpectres</name><id>15253316</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289667600000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/15253316/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
