We had plans to have happy hour here last week, but our plans were thwarted by Mr. Potato Head and his friends at Hasbro who were having a convention.  This week, we'll have a space reserved outside at this oasis in the city to relax and enjoy the last night of summer! ....Sounds like fun! So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check with the hostess, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephanie</member_name><member_id>8926850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283935886000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283552268000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Happy Hour at Aqua</name><id>14650109</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283810400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/14650109/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/b/global_5889099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
