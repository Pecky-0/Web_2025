In addition to dedicated tournaments and freeplay areas, the festival has nerdcore concerts, panel discussions, and an exhibitor hall filled with booths displaying the latest from top game publishers and developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting Sunday the 28th at the Hynes Convention Center's Cafeteria at 9:00 a.m. for coffee before the event starts at 10:00 a.m.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event does require tickets.  Advance tickets for Sunday are $30.  Tickets at the door are $35.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href="https://v2.interactiveticketing.com/tickets/t27_pax_east_2010_0903036dfd/form_buy_tickets.php?step=intro" target="_blank"&gt;Tickets may be purchased here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Meetup is only for Sunday, but Friday tickets are also still available. Should you be interested in attending for the rest of the weekend, you might be able to secure Saturday tickets or three day passes on &lt;a href="http://www.craigslist.org" target="_blank"&gt;Craig's List&lt;/a&gt; if you want them.  There are already postings for that now, as these tickets are sold out through PAX.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who would like to attend, should have questions in advance, you can contact Leticia at  978-744-7644. (There will be a different number posted for contacting her the day of the event.)     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here are some links regarding the event:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paxsite.com/paxeast/registration.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.paxsite.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mccahome.com/jhcc.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mccahome.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hynes Convention Center&lt;br /&gt;900 Boylston St&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02115&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Leticia and Robert in the Cafeteria.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leticia</member_name><member_id>10156175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269954427000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266203646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PAX East</name><id>12606163</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269781200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/12606163/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/6/a/global_13114970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
