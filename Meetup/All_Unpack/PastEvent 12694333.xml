New folks are welcome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;synopsis: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Towner Whitney, the self-confessed unreliable narrator of The Lace Reader, hails from a family of Salem women who can read the future in the patterns in lace, and who have guarded a history of secrets going back generations, but the disappearance of two women brings Towner home to Salem and the truth about the death of her twin sister to light.&amp;quot; The Lace Reader is a tale that spirals into a world of secrets, confused identities, lies, and half-truths in which the reader quickly finds it's nearly impossible to separate fact from fiction, but as Towner Whitney points out early on in the novel, &amp;quot;There are no accidents.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270038543000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267021456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Readers: The Lace Reader</name><id>12694333</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269795600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/12694333/</event_url></item>
