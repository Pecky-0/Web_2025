It is about a 15 minute walk from Central T or if you prefer you could use the B line and walk across the bridge, about a 10 minute walk. There is also parking if people would prefer to drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Trader Joes across the road from the park which make it easy to get your picnic lunch on the day. Has anyone go a portable bbq we could use? If no one does then we will just have a picnic instead.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try and get a cricket set online unless someone already has one they could bring along. Has anyone got a footy? If you have equipment you can bring please write it in the rsvp comments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247785711000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237062272000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Australia Day in July</name><id>9954388</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247329800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/9954388/</event_url></item>
