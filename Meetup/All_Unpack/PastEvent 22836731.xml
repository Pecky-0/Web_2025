 &lt;br /&gt;

The first is a young firm by the name of Cube. The tour will be a relaxed and conversational look into their experiences in opening their practice as well as their philosophy as well as taking a look at some of their most recent projects (they're renovating a H.H. Richardson building in Chinatown). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The second is RadLab, which is a multidisciplinary design and fabrication consulting firm located in Boston. At RadLab opportunities for integrating and intersecting disciplines are always on the agenda. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you get lost you can always call or text me at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank"&gt;402-812-3625&lt;/a&gt;. After the tour we will be going to a bar in the area for some drinks and socializing. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
