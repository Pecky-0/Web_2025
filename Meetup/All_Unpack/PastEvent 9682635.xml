They serve brunch everyday and they have a full bar with seating. Julian's dark and relaxed atmosphere is accented by unique designs and artwork displayed on the walls. Excellent service compliments their unusual and interesting dishes. Julian's is both a dining experience and trip to an art gallery all at once. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Kerrie &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.S.... WE WILL PLAN ON HAVING A POT LUCK MEET UP (or two) FOR OUR MARCH MEET UPS!  Still looking for a large enough place to hold them... but I have a few new ideas to look into!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check in with the host / hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kerrie Amatelli</member_name><member_id>2732003</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237674936000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233875362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet Up at Julian's in Providence</name><id>9682635</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235606400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/9682635/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/8/global_6156808.jpeg</photo_url></item>
