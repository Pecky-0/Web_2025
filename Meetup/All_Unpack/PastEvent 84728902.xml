We will hike through some beautiful pine woods, by several cranberry bogs, Ben's Pond and Shady Acres Campground. There will be some rolling hills, but much of the hike will be relatively flat. Hike time will be approximately two hours covering a distance of about four miles. This will be a dog friendly hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions:  From park HQ, follow road on left up hill and continue past Barrett Pond. After approximately 1 mile, take a left onto Bare Hill Road and continue for another mile to top of hill at the junction of Three Cornered Pond Road, a dirt fire road.  Look for an open area on the right.  The parking lot is on the left near the fire tower. &lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Vickstrom</member_name><member_id>11406046</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349707087000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348967536000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October First Sunday Hike</name><id>84728902</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349628300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/84728902/</event_url></item>
