&lt;p&gt;Totally last minute change.. One person &amp;amp; guest couldn't make it.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see this and have time to get to Boston by 10:30 am accepts and then email me at &lt;a href="mailto:robhill2005@yahoo.com"&gt;robhill2005@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt; in the next hour (until 9:30 am when I will be leaving my place).. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't make a max when I first created this which is why I had to go to 11 to open one more spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Sonar reserved for this Saturday and the person who I was going to go with can't make it, but I still want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was planning on leaving via Rowes wharf at 10:30 and sailing to say 1:30 to 2:00. I was going to go to the Boston Beerworks for a few after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope all is great,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobby P &lt;br /&gt;
