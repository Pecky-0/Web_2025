&lt;p&gt;Meet at &lt;a href="http://moananddove.com/"&gt;The Moan and Dove&lt;/a&gt;. A great pub in South Amherst, not far from Hampshire College. Very wide selection of beers. They don't serve food but you are more than welcome to bring your own picnic, or get take-out from any of the surrounding restaurants (please plan this ahead of time because time is limited). I also picked this place because I believe there is only one full sit-down restaurant in S. Amherst and that sometimes has a long wait. Since we need to be at Hampshire at 6:30pm or so for the film, I felt that would be cutting things too close. It might be ok to arrive at 7pm for the film but I don't know what the turnout will be like ahead of time and we want to try to get seats together.&lt;/p&gt;
