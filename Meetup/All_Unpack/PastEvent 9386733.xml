Please meet in the lobby no later than 7:25.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a guy whose life is going nowhere—the operative word being “no”—until he signs up for a self-help program based on one simple covenant: say yes to everything...and anything. Unleashing the power of “YES” begins to transform Carl’s life in amazing and unexpected ways, getting him promoted at work and opening the door to a new romance. But his willingness to embrace every opportunity might just become too much of a good thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, John Michael Higgins, Rhys Darby &lt;br /&gt;Director: Peyton Reed &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't make this one but thought I'd post it anyway in case you're looking for a few laughs,  Please look for each other in the lobby near Chatters.
