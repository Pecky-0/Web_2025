This will be our first meeting and I hope that we can get to know each other, discuss our healthy goals, plans on how we will achieve them, etc. Even if nothing comes of this challenge, maybe we can walk away with meeting some great people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatbet.net is how we're going to track our weightloss goals.  Even if it's 5 pounds or less (or more..hehe), sign-up for a FREE account and take the challenge with us.  There's no better motivation to watch everyone's weightloss graphs show improvement through the weeks.  I'll start our first Fatbet challenge on May 8th and send you the details.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring $5 to pay for the food and drinks I'll provide.  If you want to bring food or wine, please feel free.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to get to my place:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're traveling by car, please Google directions and call me if you have any problems.  Parking is pretty decent on the street.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If coming by public trans, Broadway Red Line T stop is closest but still about 0.5mi walk from my place.  If it's raining, you could wait for the #9 that picks up at Broadway T and drops off right in front of my place (Broadway/E Street).  www.mbta.com can help plan your best route.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Buzz #7 or call my cell 773-290-7859</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242180484000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241451632000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FatBet Challenge - 1st mtg (get-to-know-you)</name><id>10333626</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241735400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/10333626/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/6/global_8484678.jpeg</photo_url></item>
