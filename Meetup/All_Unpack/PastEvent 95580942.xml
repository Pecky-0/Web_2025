&lt;p&gt;Ok, today is the last day before the world ends, and the winter solstice. So, come on out and dance til it all ends, or 1 am. witch every comes first. This is a new place for the Together Singles Dance. It has been great the last two times it was done here. So, please &lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/9/5/c/event_160226972.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;join Steve Ob1. and about 20 to 50+ friends for an evening of dancing and socializing. This is the largest Singles Dances in Ma. or  NH, with between 200 and 400 singles, in a ballroom setting. Yet, this is not a Ballroom Dance. So, all you need to do is just shake it to dance here. This Dance has the most tasteful variety of people and mix of ages. You will find anywhere. Please get there as close to 8 pm as possible. So, you can meet some new people as, Steve Ob1. tries to introduces you to the people at our tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the popularity of this Dance. Tables and seats will be hard to hold, much past 8:30. Plus, we have the only reserved tables there. Also, if you are late? The Cover Charge goes from $12 to $15 after 9 pm.  Ask where Steve Ob1., or where Meetup is sitting as you pay at the door. They will show you where we are sitting. Also look for our signs on our tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Steve Ob1. or Meetup at the door as you pay, &amp; the Meetup signs on our tables.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356148920000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355693132000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Andover Ma.Together Singles Dance</name><id>95580942</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356138000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/95580942/</event_url></item>
