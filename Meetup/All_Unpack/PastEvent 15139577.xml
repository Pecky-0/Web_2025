The karts are cool because they actually run on gas, not electricity. The track sounds very 'adult' - &amp;quot;sharp turns, a corkscrew and tunnel, rolling hills and off-camber corners.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: you *do* have to have a valid license - doesn't say if it has to be a MA license).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have food so we could grab dinner afterwards. Convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is $28 a track and the number of laps on either of the two tracks varies. It sounds like a lot of fun and we're dying to go! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is 4 PM good or should we make it earlier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you guys there! :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289706918000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287351562000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>F1 Boston - indoor kart racing</name><id>15139577</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289689200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/15139577/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/c/global_11514924.jpeg</photo_url></item>
