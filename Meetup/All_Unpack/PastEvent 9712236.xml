These kayak pool sessions will provide an opportunity for you to practice or learn safety skills and include bracing and rolling techniques. I'm also looking for experienced people to help with demonstrating and helping others learn these skills as well as monitor and assist. Cost is $25 per person based on a minimum of 12 people attending. I'd like to collect the money in advance to insure full attendance for each session. I'd also like to keep the number of people between 10 - 15 per session. Anyone who is experienced and would like to come to help others learn safety skills, assisted rescues or to brace and roll may attend free of charge. &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;    Once again the dates are..&lt;br /&gt;    Sunday May 3rd&lt;br /&gt;    Sunday May 10th&lt;br /&gt;    Sunday May 17th&lt;br /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP for each date to let me know which dates you'd like to attend and please send a check for $25 per session to my address below. Either write on the check or send a note with check indicating which date/dates you plan to attend. I'll be sending out more info as well as directions to those who sign-up.&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;    Neil Sheehan&lt;br /&gt;    763 Ocean Boulevard&lt;br /&gt;    Hampton, NH 03842&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in parking lot 15 minutes before session begins</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1243033917000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234272528000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May 17 Kayaking Safety, Bracing &amp; Rolling Skills - Portsmouth YMCA 4:30-7:30pm</name><id>9712236</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242592200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/9712236/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/c/6/global_7263782.jpeg</photo_url></item>
