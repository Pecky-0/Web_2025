GAME 5 Celtics @ the much despised Miami Heat.  Celtics need another win! Come on down and watch at Paddy O's in the Haymarket Boston.  Paddy O's has two large screens as well as many TVs throughout the bar and will have audio for the game.  They have several food and beer specials including 25 cent chicken wings and $2 Miller Lite drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COME ON DOWN AND CHEER ON YOUR CELTICS!! Tip-off is at 8:30pm.  I should be there by 7:30pm or so.  Come early to get a good seat! HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paddy O's is conveniently located in the Haymarket area (Green and Orange Lines), near Government Center (Blue and Green Lines) and a short walk to Park Street (Red Line).  Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink.  PLEASE PAY AS YOU GO OR MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB.&lt;/p&gt;
