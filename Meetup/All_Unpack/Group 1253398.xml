&lt;br&gt;

 DivorceCare is both a seminar and a support group. We are here to help those who have experienced separation or divorce. Our facilitators have personally experienced a divorce and through attending a DivorceCare ministry have healed and want to help you start your healing.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 Whether you have been separated 1 day, or divorced for more than 25 years, this is a safe place to start your healing.&lt;br&gt;

 Please come in on any week. The sessions are designed for you to start up whenever you need us. There is no need to wait until the beginning of a new season. Start now, you'll be glad that you did.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 Come and discover help and healing with others who understand what you are experiencing.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 The DivorceCare material is based on a Christian perspective, though people of all faiths and no faith participate in this program.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 DivorceCare is NOT a dating environment.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
