While the format remains the same as the previous Game Days, this time the monsters are the stars, showing off some of the bad guys your D&amp;amp;D party can expect to face from Monster Manual 2. One iconic D&amp;amp;D monster makes his return to the game through the 5th-level adventure Journey through the Silver Caves. Be one of the first to beat down some new baddies when you come to play in this event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-generated characters, quick start rules and player miniatures will all be provided along with light refreshments! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every one who attends will be entered to win a copy of a R.A. Salvatore novel featuring the legendary Drizzt Do'Urden which Wizards has provided us to give away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your dice (or borrow some when you get here) and have a blast!  New players are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Szewczyk</member_name><member_id>4695834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243703636000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240872783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worldwide D&amp;D Game Day - Monster Manual 2</name><id>10280369</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243112400000</time><rsvp_limit>26</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/10280369/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/e/8/global_8747864.jpeg</photo_url></item>
