We;; be there starting at 7:00 a.m. on Wed, November 14th.  There is another overpass less than one mile south called Essex Street / Saugus overpass on Route 1. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WOULD BE EXCELLENT  (AGAIN!) TO HAVE 2 OTHERS HOLD A BANNER AT THAT OVERPASS ON ROUTE 1 THE SAME MORNING-Wed, November 11th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The repetition of seeing the sign twice, about a mile apart, is very strong memorability factor. It reinforces the name Ron Paul for President. Are there any takers to do this team work banner wave?. We'll have a banner at Main street overpass. Let's have two more holding a banner or very large sign at the Essex Street overpass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another factor is that there is likely a large number of commuters travelling south from NH, and also there is nearly always a backup on Route 1 between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m., which gives them plenty of time to ponder the Ron Paul for President 2008 sign! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542575000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194696058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Route 1 Sign Wave for Ron Paul</name><id>6714301</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195041600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6714301/</event_url></item>
