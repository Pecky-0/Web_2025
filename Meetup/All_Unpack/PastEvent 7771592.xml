If you know Twin City Plaza on the Somerville/Cambridge line you can park there and walk over.  Lot's of small dogs and friendly people. Off leash and pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the reviews on Yelp:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/gold-star-mothers-park-cambridge" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figure it's so crazy in town this is the perfect weekend with weather etc to try out a new venue.&lt;br /&gt;If you can make it GREAT if not we hope to see you next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No dues this week as it's a bit on the selfish side since I want my new frenchie to get out and about with other dogs. Just gotta get the puppy energy out! Oh, and my sis's puggle will be there-totally fun dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just casual.&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;terri, Simon &amp;amp; Louie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the biggest Frenchie (Simon) and you'll find us.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208919706000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208649414000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute meetup at Gold Star Mother's Park</name><id>7771592</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208746800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/7771592/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/1/global_381217.jpeg</photo_url></item>
