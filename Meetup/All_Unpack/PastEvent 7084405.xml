(And no doubt imbibing some warm spirits too!) At our January meetup, we primitive winter bike commuters will carry on the tradition! (But don't worry, we'll be inside!) Bring your best bike-related story or memory: How you got started, why you love cycling, your biggest adventure, your best childhood memory, that time your cycling buddy did that really stupid thing, whatever. I'll bring the s'mores and hot chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's start with a group ride around the Back Bay, leaving by 7:15, and end up back at the shop for refreshments and stories. Lights are required! If you're not doing the ride, only the discussion, you can meet us at the shop when we get back at about 7:45.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy with the bright yellow jacket, brown hair and beard.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Relaxing short winter night ride, followed by hot cocoa and bike talk!</why><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200011345000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Ride and Storytelling Circle</name><id>7084405</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201132800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/7084405/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/2/global_2949602.jpeg</photo_url></item>
