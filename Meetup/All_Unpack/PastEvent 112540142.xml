&lt;p&gt;Take a virtual trip around the U.S. and beyond, to learn how people around the globe are addressing climate change and other ecosystem issues — from a student environmental justice activist in Boston, to an Inupiat community protecting the Arctic waters; an off-grid community in India undergoing an energy revolution, to a young woman in Kenya challenging a threat to a community’s water supply; from a mermaid’s poetic ode to a man’s unique tribute to his bicyclist father.   These films will be screened along with other selected shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film festival is designed for all ages and several films were submitted by student filmmakers and/or feature young people, including “Frog, Chemical, Water, You,” “Bottle vs. Tap” and “Kids Can See It, Why Can’t We.” The full schedule for the 2013 Earth Port Film Festival is available on the website &lt;a href="http://www.earthportfilm.org"&gt;www.earthportfilm.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

A pre-show reception with light refreshments begins at 6:00 PM and film screenings begin at 7:00 PM. Tickets prices are $10 for students and $15 for adults in advance ($12 and $17 at the door). Tickets for the festival can be purchased from the Firehouse Box Office at Market Square, by phone at 978-462-7336 or online at &lt;a href="http://www.firehouse.org"&gt;www.firehouse.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Port Film Festival was inspired by a desire to highlight and raise awareness of both pressing environmental issues and the important role of community media and is guided by the 2013 Earth Day theme “The Face of Climate Change.” The festival is co-sponsored by PortMedia and Transition Newburyport. Proceeds from the Earth Port Film Festival will be used to support the work of PortMedia, Newburyport’s community media center, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides independent and original public affairs, arts, education, and government programming to Newburyport and the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elizabeth </member_name><member_id>389569</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366601580000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365029983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2013 Earth Port Film Festival</name><id>112540142</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366585200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/112540142/</event_url></item>
