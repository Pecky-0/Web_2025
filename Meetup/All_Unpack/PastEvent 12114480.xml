Hopefully everybody else will be out shopping for Xmas presents...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MeetUp folks, please take a moment to post a picture of your FACE on your page so that we can find each other easily! Doesn't have to be your main profile picture, but it helps us (Assistant) Organizers locate you when meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at the picnic table in front of the downstairs cubbies. We will typically wait until about 7:15pm for everybody to arrive and team up. If you happen to come after we already hit the walls, check the dry-erase board between the two locker rooms. I will post a description of what I'm wearing on it so you can find us more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;. for directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! 3 Shopping days left until Xmas!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a burgundy Betty Boop "Santa Baby" t-shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brenda</member_name><member_id>4850804</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261613212000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261221224000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night climbing at MetroRock in Everett</name><id>12114480</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261440000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/12114480/</event_url></item>
