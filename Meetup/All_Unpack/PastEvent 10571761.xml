<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Paddle Flint Pond/Lake Quinsig, Shrewsbury&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday June 27, meet at 9:45, launch at 10:00am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a repeat trip for this year, but it should be a little different this time with the leaves out and more wildlife around.  Also, this time, we'll be sticking to the circle through the pond, into the lake and back to the pond, staying with the land, so we won't be crossing the lake through the motorboats.  This is an easy paddle, about 1 1/2 hours, so it will be a good route for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Flint Pond State Boat Ramp on Rt. 20 in Shrewsbury, which is about 100 yards east of the Shrewsbury/Worcester line.  The entrance to the boat ramp is at the traffic light at the intersection of Rt. 20 and Edgemere Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminder - PFDs are required to be worn (rangers have actually been checking, and checked us when we went to Flint Pond a few weeks ago!).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252371961000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244081114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle at Flint Pond, Shrewsbury</name><id>10571761</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246111200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/10571761/</event_url></item>
