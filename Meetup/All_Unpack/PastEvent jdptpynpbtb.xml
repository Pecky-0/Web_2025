The main theme of this week's pre-recorded talk will be presented by mindfulness teacher Joseph Goldstein on the topic of doubt and aversion (thank you Kerry for the suggestion). While we often focus on the things that we move towards and cling to that take us away from the way things are, sometimes we find it more difficult to identify and accept the subtle things we don't want in our lives and are averse to. This is particularly timely as we head into the holidays and winter months. This talk will be followed by a short meditation and discussion, as well as creating intentions for how we can integrate our insights and epiphanies into our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While many talks are from practicing Buddhists, our group focuses on the philosophies of buddhism which are the root of mindfulness training. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world. We'd love to have you join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Please try to get to the First Parish Church by 6:00pm as they have asked us to keep the door locked due to recent security issues. If you arrive after 6pm and there's no one at the door, please ring the &amp;quot;Night Bell&amp;quot; (it's on the right side right by the door and is labeled as there are two buzzers). We'll come down and get you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289868624000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288822783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Joseph Goldstein: Doubt and Aversion - Understanding How They Influence Us</name><id>jdptpynpbtb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289862000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/15414555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
