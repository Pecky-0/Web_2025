More info available on &lt;a href="http://Boston911Truth.org" target="_blank"&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Greetings fellow 9/11 Truth and Justice Seekers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please, come and join Boston 9/11 Truth this Saturday, 8/11, for a 9/11 Truth Outreach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We will begin meeting at the Park Street Station in Boston Common at 8:00 a.m.   We hope to have a HUGE impact on Boston for this &amp;quot;Eleventh Day Of Every Month&amp;quot; street action.  We will be handing out DVDs and 9/11 literature in our attempt to reach tourists and citizens in the busy city of Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have dozens of 9/11 TRUTH NOW signs so you need not bring signs.  Just bring yourselves and if you have any literature and or DVDs you wish to distribute.  And, if you are not comfortable talking to strangers about 9/11, that's okay!  Please come anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold a sign and enjoy camaraderie with others who have their eyes wide open to the neocon coup d'etat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As we all know, time is of the essence with the numerous &amp;quot;terror warnings&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gut feelings&amp;quot; not to mention the Executive Orders coming out of the White House.    PLEASE COME AND HELP US MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR WORLD!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CARPOOLING from Merrimack Valley New-Hampshire area details to be worked out, but we'll probably do something like this - to be confirmed during the week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concord, Exit 17 Park and Ride Lot - start trip&lt;br /&gt;Manchester, Murphy's parking lot - stop to pick up joiners here&lt;br /&gt;Nashua, Exit 6 visitors center - stop to pick up joiners here, then on to Boston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;email us at &lt;a href="mailto:merrimackvalley911truth@gmail.com" target="_blank"&gt;merrimackvalley911truth@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in carpooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $5.00 event cost is a suggested donation for carpooling.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>3581956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541905000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186494311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston 9/11 outreach on the 11th!</name><id>6138941</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186833600000</time><rsvp_limit>999</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/6138941/</event_url></item>
