We'll head over to the Dunkin Donuts Center at around 3:30.  Afterwards perhaps a visit to Haven Brothers (Oldest Diner on Wheels in the US) Diner will be in order to refuel after all the raucous cheering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;: Kat pointed out that there is a way we can get reduced price tickets.  There is a BOGO deal available for purchasing tickets.  I've updated the cost below to reflect that as long as we have an even number of people, the cost is $12.50.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need solid commitment by April 1 to order tickets.  I'm planning to order the 100 level tickets, which cost $25/ticket.  If you want me to purchase a ticket for you, send me $12.50 via paypal or in cash if you see me at another event between now and then.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Trinity Brewhouse at 3PM for drinks/food.
