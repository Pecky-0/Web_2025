The theme of our meet up will be a Russian Tea Party!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The party is for moms only. Sorry. My modest apartment isnt suited for young children. It will give us a chance to relax and get to know each other. For directions and confirmation please call me at               774 289 2002       .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, does anyone have a samovar? Iam afraid I dont have one. You are welcome to bring anything you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come and enjoy the holiday spirit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Marina.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231289634000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Russian Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>expatrussian-64</urlname><id>1112191</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Families with Russian Kids, Moms Club, Playgroups</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228948455000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DECEMBER GROUP MEET UP</name><id>9316664</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230404400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/expatrussian-64/events/9316664/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/1/1/global_3820625.jpeg</photo_url></item>
