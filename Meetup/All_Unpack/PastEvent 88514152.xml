Since it's the weekend before Halloween, wear your costume if you like! Or, get extra-classied-up -- wear that tux or evening gown you've been waiting for an excuse to wear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be dancing to the hot and cool tunes of The Michael Warren Quartet, an awesome Boston-based gypsy jazz band. And, blues dancers, never fear! They’ve got great slow tunes too! Julie Brown will be DJing the band breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New to dancing? As usual, we’ll have a beginner-friendly lesson before the dance, taught by Mike Legett and Dan Rosenthal, also included in the price of admission. No partner or experience necessary : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also got a performance from Jenn Martinez &amp;amp; Julie Brown, plus a fun and silly competition -- a blindfolded Jack &amp;amp; Jill! Sign up for $1 to put your name in a hat. 5 leads and 5 follows will be randomly chosen and randomly assigned a partner. Then you'll dance together blindfolded (one couple at a time, with spotters) to a bit of a song. Audience-judged, winner takes all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: 8-9pm &lt;br /&gt;

Dancing: 9-12:30am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular admission – $18 &lt;br /&gt;

Students (w/ valid ID) – $15 &lt;br /&gt;

*Lesson, coffee, tea, water, and snacks/pie are included in the price of admission&lt;/p&gt;
