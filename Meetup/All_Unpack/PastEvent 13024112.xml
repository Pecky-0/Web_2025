Love having input from the group, for sure!  It looks like this place can take reservations- well, depending on the number of guests and time of day.  I figured Thursday would be our best best in order to make sure we can secure some seating:-)  For those who attended the last event at Loco- you know exactly what I am referring to:-)  I figured 7:30 would be good time for some cocktails and apps while allowing everyone to get home from work and do what they need to do before heading out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone, and hopefully the weather will be 'happier' by then!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lisa</member_name><member_id>2136226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272152133000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fabulous Females</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore</urlname><id>1511961</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>South Shores' Fabulous Females Unite!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269874058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>By popular demand......The Yard House!!!!!!</name><id>13024112</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271979000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore/events/13024112/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/2/global_10481810.jpeg</photo_url></item>
