So far, we've had one Meetup (through Craigslist) and had some interested people show up.  I would love to have enough people join to have full games, but I am content to just throw the disc around as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let's get out there and enjoy the rest of the good weather for the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting every Thursday at 6:15 on the Salem Common and playing until it becomes dark.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just so you know, I'm David and you'll recognize me because I'm quite tall with red hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542099000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ultimate Frisbee Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemfrisbee</urlname><id>666957</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Ultimate Frisbee Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189096910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Salem Ultimate Frisbee Meetup</name><id>6309011</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189721700000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemfrisbee/events/6309011/</event_url></item>
