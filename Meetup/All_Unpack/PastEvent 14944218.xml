We are getting together for a celebration. If we each bring a hors d'oeuvres and a drink to share we will have an instant party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a time to go over the last year and share the things that have shaped our lives. We have gone through so many topics. What was you favorite? And PLEASE bring in your recommendations for 2011. We are the leading ledge of creative though. We are paving this world with the new knowledge (that we only forgot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets share a glass of wine and munch a little while we impress each other with our new ways of living!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me my friends. We are our future!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste, &lt;br /&gt;Barb&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292980224000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285802942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday/Solstice Celebration</name><id>14944218</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292976000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/14944218/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/4/global_9559044.jpeg</photo_url></item>
