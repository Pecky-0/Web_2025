<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>At our meetings we will work together to understand both the simple and complex issues that underlie procrastination and use this knowledge to help us overcome the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This group will provide a safe and supportive space to talk about our own experiences with procrastination and other unproductive habits, as well as a forum to share techniques that work for us, and lastly an opportunity to review together some of the literature on the subject and discuss it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will also provide a great opportunity to make connections with new friends who can help us be accountable and support us in our journey from procrastination to more productive living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetings will include discussion of personal experiences and techniques, discussions of articles and book excerpts relevant to procrastination and productivity, breaking into smaller groups we can stay in contact with throughout the month to help hold us accountable and support us when we stray, and hosting guest speakers who can help or provide insight.  We will also entertain ideas from group members as to what they may find helpful or topics they want to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go in the front door, then through the door that says "Moreno Law"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carola</member_name><member_id>6723765</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dayanna Moreno</member_name><member_id>8672243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244147344000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Procrastinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Metrowest-Procrastinators-and-Clutterers</urlname><id>1357989</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>Metrowest Procrastinators and Clutterers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236730419000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Metrowest Procrastinators April Meetup</name><id>9927170</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238713200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Metrowest-Procrastinators-and-Clutterers/events/9927170/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/a/global_6942970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
