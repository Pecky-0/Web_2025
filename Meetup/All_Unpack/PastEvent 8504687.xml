We're heading to Johnny D's for Salsa for Justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us before the lesson starts at 9PM.  As always, no worries if you don't dance. There's always a few SoJust folk hanging on the sidelines chatting it up.  And we picked Johnny D's especially because they have a live band.  So the music will be entertaining even if you don't want to twirl and twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kitchen won't be open, so you're welcome to grab your fare down the street at Ana's or JP Licks and bring it in.  Just no beverages...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us if you want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while hearing great salsa tunes,  are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in, or have been looking for like-minded progressives to dance with in Boston.  Be sure not to miss it if you are ready to build cross-issue coalitions - AND have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?
