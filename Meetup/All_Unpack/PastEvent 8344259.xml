<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Short version: 78 S. School St., Portsmouth, Wednesday noon ? ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to have my first post be needy ? but I only just found this group.&lt;br /&gt;(Thanks, Morey!) I do look forward to being involved once this task is&lt;br /&gt;done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of ABF U-Pack ReloCubes showing up late Tuesday and need&lt;br /&gt;at least one other person to help with a couple of heavy items on&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday. I want to get this done as quickly as possible because I am&lt;br /&gt;pretty sure I will be taking up at least one public parking spot to do&lt;br /&gt;it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news: Only one item is really heavy, and another awkward. A friend&lt;br /&gt;and I did almost all the packing by ourselves on the other end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news: The new place is a three-story duplex, and the awkward thing&lt;br /&gt;(a secretary (no, it's a kind of desk)) needs to go to the third floor.&lt;br /&gt;The heavy item (a love seat) needs to go to the second ? if it fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news: pizza and beer afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news: It's a weekday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news: Another porc has made the move!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can help, please reply privately with contact information.&lt;br /&gt;Although ABF claims that my cubes will arrive in Salisbury at 2 am&lt;br /&gt;tonight, there is always a chance that something may postpone their&lt;br /&gt;delivery. If you aren't sure if you can help, reply privately and I&lt;br /&gt;will send you my cell phone number so you can call in advance to check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much, in advance,&lt;br /&gt;Chris&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216397300000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216125229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New seacoast mover needing help unloading few heavy items</name><id>8344259</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216224000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/8344259/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
