 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;In Canton, on Ponkapoag Pond within the Blue Hill Reservation, is a white cedar bog that is rarely found in Massachusetts. The bog has a boardwalk trail through the heart of it to the bog's edge in the middle of the pond. At the start of the bog on the west side of the pond, there is a sign that shows a profile of a bog and the transition of vegetation as you progress through it. The sign states that pitcher plants, sundews and bladderworts are present in that bog. I have seen, myself, the &lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/d/2/event_172890162.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/span&gt;s and sundews in my walks on the boardwalk. The boardwalk is a tricky and often impassable way through the bog. The boards are loosely placed there and often float when the water level is high. When I passed through in October, there were three points where the planks were floating and I ended up with wet feet. There are trees available for balance, but it can be floating so high that it would be treacherous to go on - so use your best judgement. The waymark is the location where I found the first sizable plot of pitcher plants, but small plants were found earlier. &lt;br /&gt;

Park @ end of road (do not block gate).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the dcr parking lot near the trail head.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6025746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351433032000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Subnats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>science-88</urlname><id>1005141</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Suburban Naturalists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351133558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ponkapoag Bog</name><id>88471682</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351353600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/science-88/events/88471682/</event_url></item>
