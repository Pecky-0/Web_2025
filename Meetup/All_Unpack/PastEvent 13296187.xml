Last year we had a great turnout, learned a lot and had great fun - let's do it again!!   If you're new to the lessons this year - great!  If you're joining us again - even better!  Everyone is Welcome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all that joined us last year, unfortunately, the Braintree Course is not offering group lessons this year.  However, it should prove to be a great program at the Rockland Course.
