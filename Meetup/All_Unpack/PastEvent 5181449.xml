<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Marisa, EDEMG's very own party girl, has offered to host an International Cocktail Party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring the ingredients for an international cocktail (e.g., Margarita, Flying Dutchman), an imported bottle of wine, or a six-pack or more of imported beer. We'll sample nectar of the gods from all over the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also feel free to bring snacks. Marisa will provide a small selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS EVENT IS LIMITED TO 20 PEOPLE DUE TO SPACE LIMITATIONS, SO RSVP NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marisa has offered up her futon in the guest room and any floor space to those who overindulge and need to sleep it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also has 2 small dogs, so if you are allergic, be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: &lt;br /&gt;Coming from Hartford, take 84W to 9S, take the left exit for Chestnut Street. Follow Chestnut until Fairview. Take a right on Fairview. She is on the first floor of 51 Fairview Street. There is a front entrance but it cannot be left open, so it would be better to come through the back entrance (gate to backyard at the back by the garage). Park on the street, as long as it is not in front of a driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163016916000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160228785000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>International Cocktail Party</name><id>5181449</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162688400000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5181449/</event_url></item>
