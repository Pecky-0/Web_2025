&lt;p&gt;Mongolia sounds exotic, but it's easier and less expensive than you may think to do-it-yourself. On her first-ever sojourn abroad, Sage Cohen spent three months traveling Mongolia with a bicycle. She spent the subsequent two summers there, traveling by four hooves and a thumb. This slide show (yes, real Kodak slides!) opens a view on the landscape, people and culture of this Central Asian land, including a composite of her many weeks exploring the country by horse. Sage Cohen has become an intrepid traveler since her 40th birthday. She has traveled by bicycle in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India, China, Tibet, Latvia and Southeast Asia. Mongolia was her first love.&lt;/p&gt;
