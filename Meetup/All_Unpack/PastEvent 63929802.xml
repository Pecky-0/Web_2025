&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a poll for the June book and you guys chose Rainbows End by &lt;span&gt;Vernor Vinge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Amazon synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer's patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!   &lt;br /&gt;

 -Josh&lt;/p&gt;
