Earn exclusive rewards as you gain Renown Points for accomplishments made during each season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Season 2 takes place in the upcoming Dark Sun campaign setting.  Adventure in the deserts of Athas where just surviving the unrelenting heat, vicious monsters, and others trying to scavenge out an existence in a brutal world decimated by reckless magic is hard enough.  All characters are pre-generated so all you have to do is show up and play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have friends or family interested in D&amp;amp;D and looking for a great introduction to what 4th edition has to offer, have them come and join us for an evening of adventure at Veteran's Gaming in Warwick.  Sessions will start at 6PM and should run from 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who played in Season 1, Rewards Cards earned in that adventure are fully legal for use in all subsequent seasons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282843261000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276197917000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Encounters: Dark Sun  Season 2</name><id>djbtnynlbhc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282773600000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/13762552/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
