&lt;p&gt;Who are the “nones”, the religiously unaffiliated, and what does that mean? Join Katrina Scott in a conversation about the recent survey, conducted in 2012 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which documents a rise in the number of people identifying themselves as non-affiliated with a particular religion.The Pew Forum study found that about 20% of adult Americans have no religious affiliation. That figure represents an increase of roughly 5% since 2007. Katrina will explore the trends behind the numbers, and discuss what they say about the Humanism and secularism in America today.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363537858000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363276736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Rise of the "Nones”</name><id>109243922</id><duration>7200000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363530600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/109243922/</event_url></item>
