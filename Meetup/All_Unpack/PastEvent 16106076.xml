This time I would like to go to Rumney.  We'll be doing some top roping plus some simple, easy lead climbing.  Please bring your climbing gear, warm clothes and snacks, including belay device, biners, ropes, ice screws, webbing, harness, helmet, axes, crampons, balaclava, gloves+mittens+heat packs, etc.  We'll meet up at the parking lot (43.802219, -71.829898) at Rumney, at 8 AM--before the crowd comes.  I might be setting up one or both of my ropes, so you might have to look around for me.  Let me know if you are a beginner, so I can advise you on what to bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken D.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken Domino</member_name><member_id>4332297</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295915852000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295450817000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ice climbing Jan 23</name><id>16106076</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295787600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/16106076/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/d/global_20911021.jpeg</photo_url></item>
