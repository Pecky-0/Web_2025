Our team will then assign you a table of approximately eight to ten fellow young professionals (evenly matched between the sexes) who we believe best meet your interests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Participating in the profiling is optional. Also, you are not required to answer any profiling questions that you do not wish to answer. We will ask you to rank your answers in order of importance, to help us assess just what traits you most likely want in your table partners. For the first and final hours of this event, however, we offer a social reception for you to meet and socialize with all of the evening's attendees, not just the people you sit with at dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where is the dinner?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, we transport to one of Boston's most popular restaurants (with locals and visitors)- Durgin Park (in Faneuil Hall). For well over a century, Durgin-Park has catered to the hearty appetites of straw-hatted, white-aproned market men and local characters. Today it hosts visiting celebrities, business men and women, students, and tourists from every part of the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A post reception (with cash bar) at a nearby venue is included where you can mix and mingle with everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHOICE OF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Yankee Pot Roast&lt;br /&gt;- Boston Baked schrod&lt;br /&gt;- Fish and Chips&lt;br /&gt;- Roast Stuffed Tom Turkey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each Served with potato and vegetable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vegetarian Selection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;choice of:&lt;br /&gt;- Grilled Seasonal Vegetable Platter&lt;br /&gt;- Pasta Primavera&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All served with Cornbread and Butter Coffee, Tea, or Soda, Iced Tea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DESSERT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Vanilla Ice Cream with Hot Fudge Drizzle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Attire: Business Casual Please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Durgin Park&lt;br /&gt;340 Faneuil Hall Market Pl&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02109&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $40.00&lt;br /&gt;Price subject to increase at any time.
