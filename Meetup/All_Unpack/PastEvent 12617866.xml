I am a member of a Masonic Lodge that meets downtown, and happen to know that every Lodge in the entire commonwealth will be hosting an open house on Saturday, March 27, 2010. The great thing about the Lodges that meet downtown is that we share the building with the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. That means we have a decent budget and put on a heck of a show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past we've had Ben Franklin, Paul Revere, and other patriot impersonators coming in and giving demonstrations on a real printing press, the history of our state/country flag, etc. I think this time we'll be having some fife and drum players, but I'm fuzzy on all of the details as I personally am not organizing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event runs from 9am to 3pm and you can stop by whenever you want. In the AM there will be some breakfast stuff, pastries, coffee and juice; lunch should be served around 12 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be tours available throughout the day, given by professionally trained tour guides and Members of the Lodges that meet downtown. If you have never seen the building, it is gorgeous. It's 9 floors are ornately decorated, and the history in those walls dates back to the revolution (though the building itself is newer since it's burnt down two or three times!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fee and no limit on people. If you have any questions just send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269868535000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266335929000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>History, the Masons, and Free Food!</name><id>12617866</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269694800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/12617866/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
