<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will be meeting up for appetizers / dinner @ Pho Dakao before heading over to Gilrein's.  &lt;br /&gt;This Vietnamese restaurant is reasonably priced and also has had some very good reviews. There is ample parking. They serve beer &amp;amp; wine in addition to other beverages. I am not sure if they will do separate checks?  So, if this is the case, I hate to ask but...  please make sure you bring enough cash to pay your bill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE: I will try to be there earlier. Depending on how many respond I will work on a reservation. &lt;br /&gt;             Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;             _Jo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>When entering the restaurant ask for the meetup table.
