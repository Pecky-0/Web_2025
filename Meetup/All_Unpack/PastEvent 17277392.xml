Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity  to Parkinson's disease, and their children have long since flown the  family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a  once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his  wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not  clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly  secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of  work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only  to pour her youth and heart down the drain of an affair with a married  man - or so her mother fears.
