 &lt;br /&gt;

For starters, according to the Institute for Responsible Technology, “genetically modified foods have been linked to &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

-toxic and allergic reactions, &lt;br /&gt;

-sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and &lt;br /&gt;

-damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The effects on humans of consuming these new combinations of proteins produced in GMOs are unknown and have not been studied.” &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

And genetically modified food is found in most highly processed foods, including cereal, chips, candy, and canned food.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Our speaker this month is &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whitney Riggs, the founder of GMO Free Hartford.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Riggs is also on the leadership committee of GMO Free CT, a grassroots organization whose mission is to harness education, advocacy, and bold action to foster consumer rejection of genetically modified organisms, until they are proven safe.  Riggs is currently studying to become a Certified Holistic Health Counselor at the Institute of Integrative Nutrition in New York City.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Riggs will discuss: &lt;br /&gt;

-what GMOS are, &lt;br /&gt;

-the different places GMOs are hidden, &lt;br /&gt;

-what you can do to eliminate GMOS from your diet and eat on a budget,  &lt;br /&gt;

-how to avoid GMOS at restaurants and at social gatherings. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

She will also discuss efforts to require labeling of GMOS in Connecticut and ways you can get involved. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you are familiar with this important issue, please join us, reaffirm your commitment to healthy eating, and share with others how you eliminated GMOs from your diet.    &lt;br /&gt;
