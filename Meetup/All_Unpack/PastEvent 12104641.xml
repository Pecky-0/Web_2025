Let's meet in the Tavern, immediately to your right when you enter the Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Take Route 20W off of route 128. Continue straight into Sudbury. You'll pass a lot of stuff, eventually coming to a road that bears right at about 2:00 (direction, not time) with a sign &amp;quot;Wayside Inn&amp;quot;. Take that, and the Inn is on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENE: The Tavern of the Wayside Inn is just beautiful, and small, with a fireplace, pewter mugs, an historic bar. There is a limit on RSVPs to this one, since we can't flood the place. I would hope everyone would at least order something, a coke, beer, coffee, wine, so that we are paying customers for the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: This is more of a travel session, so please pack extra light, ideally nothing more than a 5x8 sketchbook. Also, expect that we will converse while we sketch, unlike most BPAAG meet-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call the Inn or myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262027316000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261076662000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDOOR SKETCH GET-TOGETHER: Wayside Inn, Sudbury</name><id>12104641</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261854000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/12104641/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/c/global_1743932.jpeg</photo_url></item>
