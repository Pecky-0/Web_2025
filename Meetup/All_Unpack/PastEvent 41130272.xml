This great group certainly warrants some year-end celebrating. Prepare to dust off your holiday duds and your good cheer for a Yuletide soiree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing makes the holidays more festive than spending an evening with good friends and good food. So, let's have a night of it on Saturday, December 17. The party will start at 6:00 and last until the tinsel falls or David falls asleep. Please, bring an appetizer or dessert; alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for those who are feeling extra festive, there will be a Yankee Swap. Every year that we do this, it winds up being a big hit. Should you please, bring a gender-neutral gift under $10 for an exchange game. There will also be door prizes and surprises throughout the evening, celebrating another great year we have had as a Meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the evening, we'll pass on the board games, but get excited for some party games with prizes and socializing with some people you might not have met at previous Meetups. If this will be your first Meetup with us, prepare to have a great time and meet some fabulous people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be a $5 fee for this Meetup. You can pay it in person in advance of the Meetup, the night of the Meetup, or in advance through Paypal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 * You should know that we are a household with cats , but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to two small children (3 and 1) who will not be locked up for the evening, but they will eventually go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*In case of a snow emergency, please make sure to check the website or your e-mail for any updates. You are always welcome to call the contact number as well. The snow date will be Saturday, January 7. If there is another snow storm then, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325610424000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321297395000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Annual Yuletide Gathering</name><id>41130272</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324162800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/41130272/</event_url></item>
