Roosevelt at the end of Prohibition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this day, 75 years ago, the states ratified the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment, a law which had outlawed alcohol. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's have a drink (you have the right to choose one with alcohol or without) or two to toast the freedom to imbibe alcohol legally....that is if you're at least 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I chose 21st Amendment for our happy hour for its name only. What is the adage? Location Location Location, well this was because of Name Name Name. I've probably passed this place a thousand times but never went inside, therefore I can't give an opinion on the atmosphere nor food. However, if it is anything like it's sister bar, Blarney Stone in Dorchester it should be wonderful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out this link for details &lt;a href="http://21stboston.com/home.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://21stboston.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there when you can.
