Fat Belly's is a local RI Pub chain (can you really call it that if its local?) with other locations in Wakefield, East Greenwich and Warwick. Will it measure up to the homey coziness of 3 Steeple Street, or present us with something completely new? I haven't been, so let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver or green fleece scarf!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
