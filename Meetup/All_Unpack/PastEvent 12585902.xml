Since many of you liked Annie's idea, I am scheduling a Meetup at the location she suggested. Annie cannot do Sundays which is when I could do it myself, so in light of the fact that this is her suggestion and she requested a day that she could attend, I am scheduling it for Saturday, Feb 27th.  However, I regret I will be unable to attend as I have to work. I hope you have a great time and that you post reviews and photos afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cafe on the Common&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.commonrootscafe.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.commonroot...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;677 Main St&lt;br /&gt;Waltham, MA 02452&lt;br /&gt;(781) 647-2456&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>HS Loh</member_name><member_id>9828275</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267470792000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Tea Connoisseurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Tea-Connoisseurs</urlname><id>1479042</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Tea Connoisseurs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265943493000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tea at Common Room Cafe in Waltham</name><id>12585902</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267297200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Tea-Connoisseurs/events/12585902/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/f/global_9325583.jpeg</photo_url></item>
