Water St. (this is the area with a few bars across from Narragansett Electric and infront of the hurricane barrier on the water.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So its been HOT lately, and at last check  the forecast is that the heat will break on Monday sometime. So in celebration of the forthcoming cooler weather (maybe), we're heading down to the Hot Club to take in the Providence skyline and maybe a breeze or two under the roofed deck overlooking the Providence River. So if you haven't been in awhile, or even if you have, let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing some kind of scarf, but we're hard to miss - look for us on the outside deck!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
