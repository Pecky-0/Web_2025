It’s the cross-cut tale of two men whose fateful meeting propelled them on divergent courses with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, 9/11, Guantanamo Bay Prison and the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abu Jandal is a taxi driver in Sana’a, Yemen; his brother-in-law Salim Hamdan is a Guantanamo prisoner and the first man to face the controversial military tribunals. Jandal and Hamdan’s intertwined personal trajectories—how they became bin Laden’s bodyguard and driver respectively—act as prisms that serve to explore and contextualize a world which has confounded Western media. As Hamdan’s trial progresses, his military lawyers challenge fundamental flaws in the court system. The charismatic Jandal dialogues with his young son, Muslim students and journalists, and chillingly unveils the complex evolution of his belief system post-9/11. Winner of Best Documentary Cinematography at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, The Oath offers a rare window into a hidden realm—and the international impact of the U.S. War on Terror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IFF Grand jury prize for documentary feature is &amp;quot;The Oath,&amp;quot; directed by Laura Poitras&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times Critics Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Oath” and Ms. Poitras’s previous documentary, “My Country, My Country” (about a political candidate in Iraq), reflect the lessons of Errol Morris and other documentarians who put a high gloss on nonfiction. Here she goes to great lengths to inject surprise into the narrative, strategically withholding information, including the double and triple meanings of her title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may leave “The Oath” feeling that Ms. Poitras’s considerable skills as a filmmaker and packager have been employed to make more out of her material than is really there. (It doesn’t hurt that the film’s score is composed by Osvaldo Golijov and sung, in part, by Dawn Upshaw, two of the biggest names in modern classical music.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;Following the film, we'll enjoy dinner and discussion at a nearby eatery.  Look for John to be standing in the lobby or just outside the Coolidge holding a Meetup Sign and gathering members for the walk to the restaurant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the movies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will be standing in the Lobby or just outside the theatre holding a Red Meetup sign and checking in members with the Secret Oath.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274957636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>THE OATH</name><id>13611454</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276375500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/13611454/</event_url></item>
