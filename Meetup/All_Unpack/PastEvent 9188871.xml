<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello Members, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am STILL looking for assistant organizers who are responsible and reliable.  If you're interested, please read the following criteria/rules/responsibilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ONLY ATTEND THIS LUNCH IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT BEING AN ASSISTANT ORGANIZER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the key responsibilities will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Each asst. organizer will need to organize regular meetups: a minimum of one meetup per asst. organizer every two months.  This will give the members of the group ample opportunity to meet others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Asst. Organizers must be responsible and arrive to meetups on time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Asst. Organizers shall behave in a respectful, non-discriminatory manner to all members of the group.  If any conflicts or concerns arise, I must be notified and involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Meetups cannot be canceled or changed within 48 hours of scheduled time.  It will be the asst. organizer's responsibility to contact notify members of changes/cancellations prior to 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Asst. Organizers cannot add or remove members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Asst. Organizer cannot send spam to any or all members of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Asst. Organizers will share the cost of running the meetup:  $9 for 3 months per asst. organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Asst. Organizers can step down from their position at any time, but must either cancel their meetups at least 48 hours in advance or fulfill their meetup schedule before stepping down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Asst. Organizers should be available via email and respond in a timely manner.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a comprehensive list of duties/rules.  It will evolve as we go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure to comply by these rules may result in removing the person as asst. organizer or even as member of the meetup group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to meet all of you before choosing the final 4 people who will serve as Asst. Organizers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  &lt;br /&gt;Tuhina&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230773927000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-27</urlname><id>610218</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Group Closing - Indian Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227054532000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Assistant Organizer Lunch</name><id>9188871</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228672800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-27/events/9188871/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/e/global_2194158.jpeg</photo_url></item>
