The producer has neither association with, nor membership of, any political organisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short subjects&lt;/b&gt; - bring what you think others should see - we'll see what shorts we have time to view. We also have the capability to show You Tube and Google videos, so bring your links.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: &lt;b&gt;1st Tuesday-Nashua&lt;/b&gt;; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; 4th Tuesday- Bristol (this meeting changing to another night). If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, we'll have a special organizing meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive by 7:00 PM&lt;/b&gt;, since this meeting is on a tight schedule. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and the video will begin promptly at 7:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring healthy snacks and/or drinks&lt;/b&gt; for sharing, since some may have come to our meeting directly from work. Contributing a box of tea is always a good idea to build an inventory of available beverages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking is in the lot in front of the building&lt;/b&gt;. Please enter the right entry doorway and suite 135 will be directly ahead of you. After entering the office, turn left to go to the video viewing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspaper&lt;/b&gt; - For an interesting paper which covers 9/11 Truth issues and other topics of concern, visit the &lt;a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rock Creek Free Press&lt;/a&gt; out of Washington, D.C. and see &lt;a href="http://9-11.meetup.com/307/pages/Newspapers_and_Journals/"&gt;our meetup page for others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have set up a &amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot; online&lt;/b&gt; at eRideShare.com.
