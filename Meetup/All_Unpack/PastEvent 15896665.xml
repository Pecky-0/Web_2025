<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Wingmen and Wingwomen,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to attend a Connecticut Whale hockey game! Bring whoever you want to bring for a good time to socialize and enjoy the game. The doors open at 6p.m. to the Hartford XL Center so we are going to plan on getting there around 6-6:45. We will be meeting up at Koji's for 05:15-05:50 then head to the game. This way we can all sit together as a group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on pre gaming the whole hour before the game starts and hope you all can join me in doing that :) Everyone that plans on attending....if I don't have your number then send it to me via private message or text me at 860-919-9782 letting me know who you are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks as though getting tickets right at the box office is not going to be hard at all. Here's the link to their website so you all can take a look if you have to: &lt;a href="http://www.hartfordwolfpack.com/default.asp?ctwhale=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hartfordwo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Text or call John at 860-919-9782.
