Father Peter will be teaching a seminar each evening that he is here this week. This is a very special event, and we are already anticipating that many group members will be attending all three seminars with this very dynamic and knowledgeable teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second evening: Learning to Love Yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people harbor deep and secret feelings that there is something inherently wrong with them. This results in people feeling 'less than' others or having to make themselves feel 'better than' others. In fact, if you could see yourself as your Creator sees you, you would know thoroughly that you are completely loved and accepted. This doesn't mean there's not work to do on yourself, but it does mean your heart can rest in the knowing that while you are doing the work, you are supported by the God of Love. Come and begin the journey toward love of God and self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
