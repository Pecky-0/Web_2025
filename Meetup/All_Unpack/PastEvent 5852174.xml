Burt, a 32 year-old married attorney and Linda, a beautiful, single 20 year-old girl living in the Bronx had a whirlwind romance, which culminated in a violent and psychologically complex set of actions that landed the pair's saga on the cover of endless newspapers and magazines.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the cooperation of the principles, Burt, now 79, and Linda, 68, Klores examines the human psyche and the concepts of love, obsession, insanity, hope and forgiveness.  CRAZY LOVE recently had its world premiere at the 2007 Sundance Festival and earned the Best Documentary award at the 2007 Santa Barbara Film Festival&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181343839000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1180985641000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE ADVANCED SCREENING - CRAZY LOVE</name><id>5852174</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181170800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5852174/</event_url></item>
