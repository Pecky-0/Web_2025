Looking for like-minded progressives to hang out with in Boston? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions? Join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESIST Foundation has been funding social change since 1967.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Each ye&lt;/span&gt;ar RESIST funds over 100 amazing grassroots organizations around the country. These groups use grants from RESIST to develop leadership, work on innovative grassroots campaigns, hire organizers, distribute literature and videos related to those campaigns and demand justice on a variety of issues. Most of their grantees reach across issues to connect communities and struggles. Their work spans anti-militarism, prisoners' rights, community organizing, GLBTQ justice, environmental justice, antiracism, disability rights, youth organizing, Native Peoples' rights and more. Since 1967, RESIST has awarded grants to thousands of radical and progressive groups engaged in organizing for social change.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What should you expect?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Our usual friendly and welcoming space where it's easy to meet people even if it's your first SoJust event. Plenty of socializing time to mix, mingle and network with fellow progressives. The opportunity to learn more about RESIST and how you can support their efforts with a donation. (&lt;em&gt;Consider becoming a monthly donor!&lt;/em&gt; Your gift of $25 a month = $300 a year. Just think, you can "buy a round for justice" each month and help fund the movement!) Gifts of all sizes welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; $5 collected at the door supports SoJust. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;Complimentary appetizers will be available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SoJust is all about building a cross-issue progressive community and network in Boston.&lt;/strong&gt; We're doing it by putting the SOCIAL back in SOCIAL JUSTICE. We focus on creating welcoming spaces that foster relationship-building across issue silos. Join us if you are ready to go BEYOND ALLIES and build a CROSS-ISSUE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCESSIBILITY: Must be 21+ to enter after 7PM. The venue is physically accessible - elevator is at the back of the venue and bathrooms are big enough for manual, but not motor-powered, wheelchairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARKING: Lir is across from the Hynes Convention Center. Parking near Lir is really hard - you could get lucky or you could drive around for 30 or more minutes. There are parking garages by Back Bay station. Best bet is to take the T to Back Bay or Hynes Convention Center (which is the closest T stop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HELP SPREAD THE WORD!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
