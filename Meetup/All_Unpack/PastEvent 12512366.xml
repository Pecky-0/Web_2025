If you stayed away from the mountains last weekend due to the holiday and the kids school vacation this is the weekend to reclaim your favorite trails!  We have a weekend of fun planned and now would be a great time to come check out the lodge if you haven't already.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our lodge is in Bartlett, NH just 2 miles from Attitash and close to Wildcat, Black, Bretton Woods &amp;amp; Cranmore.  Even Sunday River is only 45 minutes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be offering a dinner this weekend for $15 consisting of salad, spaghetti &amp;amp; meatballs, and dessert.  Vegetarian option available.  Please indicate in your RSVP if you would like dinner.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests are welcome for $20 per night lodging at the club. Full details and information will be sent to all Yes RSVPs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All members and guests must be 21+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you up north!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come on in!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dan</member_name><member_id>8253363</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266810133000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265243175000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend at the Bretts, February 19 - 21, 2010</name><id>12512366</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266631200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/12512366/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/7/global_6852807.jpeg</photo_url></item>
