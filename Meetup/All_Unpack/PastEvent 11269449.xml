He is overworked, under stimulated and under appreciated. His outlook on life changes after seeing a hypnotherapist who dies before releasing Peter from his command to relax deeply and completely. Peter decides that he isn't going to quit his lame job, but that he simply isn't going to go to it anymore. After a vicious round of layoffs, Peter and his co-workers (the unfortunately named Michael Bolton and the eternally frustrated Samir) hatch a plot to unleash a virus that will rob their greedy company blind&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... has anyone seen my stapler? It's a red Swingline.&lt;br /&gt;... Oh, and the two Bobs want to see you. &lt;br /&gt;... No, I do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to see you demonstrate your &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the box office and pick up ticket using the credit card you used to make the online purchase and meet T.J. by 6:15 pm, when they make the announcement for everyone to form a line along the brick wall. T.J. Maher will get there at 6:00 pm. T.J. is 5 foot 7, with blue eyes, short brown hair, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Where would you like to go after? Sushi? Zaftig, the Jewish Deli? Finale? Elsewhere? I think we should be out of the show by 9:00 pm. I'll be waiting on the sidewalk holding up a red MEETUP sign simultaneously trying to gather people together and not blocking the sidewalk at the same time after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Coolidge Corner Theater&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coolidge.org/history" target="_blank"&gt;http://coolidge.org/h...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The renaissance of the Coolidge began in 1999, when volunteer Board Member Joseph Zina became Executive Director. With the generous cooperation of the The Hamilton Charitable Trust and Harold Brown the theater negotiated a 50-year lease and forgiveness of $350,000 of debt. With intitial preservation and restoration grants from foundations the basic infrastructure of the theatre began. HVAC, electrical, plumbing problems were solved. New restrooms, lighting, and carpeting created a momentum of optimism that the community quickly rallied behind. In 2000, old office space became a video screening room that added digital opportunities for local filmmakers to show their work in a professional setting and rental opportunities for increase revenue. In 2002, the build out of a childrens' performance stage thanks to a donation transformed the small upstairs moviehouse into a theatrical space that expanded community programming and brought in family audiences. Later that year, a new theatre marquee became a beacon of optimism and a stimulus for the rebirth of the business community. In 2006, a facility renovation of $1.2million added handicap and hearing disability services throughout the theatre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Coolidge is the only operating not-for-profit Art Deco theatre in the Boston area and is one of the top ten arthouse film exhibition theaters in the county. From the sponsoring of china giveaways during the Depression to the visits honoring Zhang Yimou, Vittorio Storaro, Meryl Streep, Thelma Schoonmaker and Jeremy Thomas the Coolidge Corner Theatre has played a unique and indelible role in the development and social history of the town of Brookline&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coolidge.org/map" target="_blank"&gt;http://coolidge.org/m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nearby metered public parking is available behind the theatre (on Center St. one block from Harvard St.) and along Beacon Street.
