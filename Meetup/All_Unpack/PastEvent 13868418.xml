<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This hike will be at Valley Falls in Vernon CT.  The hike will be approximately 3.5 miles and last about 2 hours.  We will be hiking the longest path of the loop trail clockwise and detour up to lookout trail near the end of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Unlike my other hikes this hike will be at a stronger pace.  Folks that have struggled to keep up in the past should be fine if they are prepared to challenge themselves but the folks who fall behind on my other hikes may not not want to hike this.  We will not be going exceptionally fast and the trail is not overly difficult but the pace will be consistent and there's a steep climb near the end of the hike.  If things go as planned we will take a longer than usual break at the top of the mountain (20 minutes hopefully) to enjoy the view, so you might want to bring a snack.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAIN CANCELS : you will be notified via email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attendance list is printed out at 5pm on the day of the hike so be sure to remove yourself from the hike if you can't make it. Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a day pack, water, insect repellent, sunscreen, and waterproof boots. I will make every effort to get us back to our cars before sunset but please bring a small flashlight for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a hiking group. That means we start together and we finish together and are only as fast as our slowest hiker. Please keep this in mind if you decide to join us. Also, keep an open mind to hikes having to be shortened on-the-fly if the group is moving slower than expected. I do not want us to get caught in the dark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Dogs or Children: Feel free to email me or contact me through here if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=41.818136,-72.439578&amp;amp;spn=0.013961,0.033023&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;msid=106880071684886446021.000489913330c1ee6b5d9" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
