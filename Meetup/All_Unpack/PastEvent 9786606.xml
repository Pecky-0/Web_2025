<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Welcome to Monthly Movies! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you open minded about art, books and culture? Well... if so... this is a great way to continually be exposed to a diverse array of indie films, documentaries and some highly acclaimed mainstream movies  once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a month let's head out in a group earlier in the week or on weekend afternoons to see a film. Why then? You won't  ever have to deal with large crowds and movies being sold out :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm taking movie recommendations. So please send me your suggestions. Thanks...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either before or after movies... people can grab a drink and/or something to eat.  After the film, people can hangout to discuss what they've just seen.  It's all up to you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Theaters will be in Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville. And the goal is to always mix things up by seeing a diverse array of indie films, documentaries and some mainstream movies.  IMAX/OMNI Theater will also be included into the mix.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238716442000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235173138000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Movies - just tossing it out to see if there's any interest</name><id>9786606</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237851000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9786606/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/7/global_7617415.jpeg</photo_url></item>
