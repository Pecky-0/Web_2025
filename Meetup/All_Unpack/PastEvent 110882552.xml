Living in the house I designed for my family has allowed me to better appreciate the visual pleasures of architecture--captured light and space, framed views, interior space juxtaposed with landscape. For me, architecture is a way of life. It provides intellectual engagement, rich opportunities for relationships with people and opportunities to improve the "craft" of building. The greatest pleasure in my working life is to personally engage with clients to imagine the possibilities for architecture in their lives and for their institutions. I strive to provide personable leadership to clients and design teams, to build consensus, to address the complexities of competing interests within groups and to persistently follow a project's development from the design dream to its architectural reality. I value the relationship I hold with each client, the challenges of sustainable designs for their buildings, and the opportunity to shape the strategy for the future of Shepley Bulfinch.
