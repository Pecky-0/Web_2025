Washington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Walkabout Trail is in the George Washington Management Area in Glocester, RI. There are 3 loops from which to choose. We'll aim for the 8 mile orange blazed loop. (Okay, maybe the 6 mile red blazed trail.) The difficulty level is described as &amp;quot;relatively easy, but with considerable rocky footing.&amp;quot; Other meetup members have described it as &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; due to the rocky terrain. Please note it is swampy in areas this time of year so wear appropriate footwear.  Estimated hike time is 4 hours. We may want to stop to eat along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: US 44 to the George Washington Camping Area, about 4.5 miles west of Chepachet. Turn right onto the campground road and continue 0.3 mile until you reach a lane that runs to the left by the park office. Turn and park along this wide lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: John and I are leading a series of hikes to prepare us for the Mt Washington hike on Memorial Day weekend. We are starting with some easier ones and working our way up to some more difficult terrain and elevation gains, so if you go on a bunch of these then you should be ready to tackle Washington with us in late May.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269961484000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269187642000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walkabout Trail</name><id>12946681</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269788400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/12946681/</event_url></item>
