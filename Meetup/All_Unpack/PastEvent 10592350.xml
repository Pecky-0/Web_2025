Please, bring your favorite games to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is at the ferry landing off of Blaney Street -- lots of room there.  Their home is on the third floor, and to get there, please use the back stairs. If you need more directions on the night of the event, please note the above listed number.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Megan and Geoff's is also home to two big, overly friendly dogs who will not be locked up.  So, being dog friendly is a must.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247245474000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244319666000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night as Megan and Geoff's</name><id>10592350</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246057200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/10592350/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/8/9/global_3094489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
