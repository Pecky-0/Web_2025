Bring your favorite sailing items - whether it be binoculars, jacket, compass, book, whatever - to share with the group. Photos or images of gear are also fine. Share your trusty tools and learn about great gadgets from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest we meet at the Au Bon Pain in Kendall Square. 3 reasons: it's at the corner of Hayward and Main in Cambridge, a short block from the Kendall T Redline Stop (ABP towards Longfellow Bridge). There is free parking  in MIT's &amp;quot;medical lot&amp;quot; on Hayward St. and people can order food or not as they please. -SJ&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 16327</member_name><member_id>16327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540705000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162946008000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Sailing December Meetup</name><id>5251582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165361400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/5251582/</event_url></item>
