Here are the details of the June meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This monthâ€™s topic: Adam's Greatest Hits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many of you know, I'll be leaving the Boston area next month.  Therefore, I wanted to pick a few of my favorite NLP techniques to leave you with before I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts right now are that we will start with the technique &amp;quot;Spinning Feelings&amp;quot; (unless many of you already know it, in which case we may do the anchoring technique &amp;quot;Change Personal History&amp;quot;).  I'd like to finish with metaphorical problem-solving, where we'll literally &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; our way out of our problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time permitting, I may also demonstrate one or more advanced patterns.  These may include the Decision Destroyer technique, the NLP allergy cure, the Walt Disney creativity strategy, and/or 6-step Reframing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP, let me know if you're particularly interested in particular techniques, either the ones I've mentioned or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the main part of the evening (7:15-9:15), you are all welcome to stay for some farewell socializing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Marx&lt;br /&gt;NLP Master Practitioner&lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP&lt;br /&gt;317 N Main St, Natick MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;(617) 329-1657&lt;br /&gt;adam@NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;www.NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Helping you to become the you that you want to be:&lt;br /&gt;Coaching, Counseling, and Training&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go straight back to the large studio (after 7pm)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278383933000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273975379000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston NLP June Meetup - Adam's Greatest Hits</name><id>dlfdnynjbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277421300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/13495519/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/0/global_11885328.jpeg</photo_url></item>
