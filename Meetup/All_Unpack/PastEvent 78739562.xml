<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We will spend about an hour or so playing games that will help the children to come to a better understanding of their intuitive abilities (parents too). During the potluck lunch, parents can ask questions about how to help their children with their abilities (note, the words, amazing, weird, strange, and so forth are not allowed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children will also have an opportunity to play on the wooded property (in the past they have repaired fairy houses they found, sited spirit dragons and other spirit creatures and talked to the trees).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348352556000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345579503000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Intuitive Play Day for Children and their Parents!</name><id>78739562</id><duration>9000000</duration><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348324200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/78739562/</event_url></item>
