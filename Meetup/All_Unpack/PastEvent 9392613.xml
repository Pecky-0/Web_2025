I plan to discuss our group's goals and objectives and hope you will share your ideas for future meetup events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please submit payment through Paypal when you sign up. To reduce no-shows, the $5 fee will not be refunded unless the organizer cancels the event due to low participation or bad weather. Please be sure you can attend before you RSVP. The $5 donation will help cover for the meetup administration fee I pay as the organizer. If you would like to send a check instead, please contact the organizer for the mailing address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All members are welcome I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233621588000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230394743000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trident Dinner and Networking</name><id>9392613</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233102600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/9392613/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
