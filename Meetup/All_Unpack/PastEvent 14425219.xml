We will find, your strength, and start there, then develop the others using simple techniques to practice on your own. This is a beginner class meant to help you find your strengths and weaknesses, though if you are already aware, but want to practice and develop some of your weaker gifts, this is a great venue as well. Even though I am working as a professional I still sit in a development group to keep myself sharp and practiced. We learn from each other and when working alone too long you may forget some of the fun and excitement you had when you just began this journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time:12-3pm&lt;br /&gt;Bring: Notebook, object, pen and pencil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join this class is definately a more the merrier kind of class and for that reason I am expanding the limit to 20 people instead of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refund policy: there will be no refunds given, but in the case of a cancellation, you are free to take any other class or healing as long as I am given 24 hours of notification.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Readings By JD</member_name><member_id>9397498</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282523937000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gifted</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Friends-in-Spirit</urlname><id>1373252</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Friends in Spirit</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281838284000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Workshop: Psychic Development-Discover your gifts</name><id>14425219</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282492800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Friends-in-Spirit/events/14425219/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/4/global_7183796.jpeg</photo_url></item>
