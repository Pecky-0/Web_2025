"The Levee", produced by Duke Robillard, covers the roots, styles, playing and original material of a serious modern blues band, that holds great respect for the past.

Evolving to further embrace the blues while also adding pop influences, he followed up with two more albums and his triumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed “Fall Changes” Recorded at Levon Helm’s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the famed drummer’s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent tours of Europe. The Chris Bergson Band's latest CD Imitate the Sun was named MOJO's #2 Blues Album of 2011. &lt;br /&gt;

King, Schinnery decided to make blues his life's work. Since becoming a professional in the mid-1950s, Schinnery has toured or recorded with Jimmy Witherspoon, Big Mama Thornton, King Curtis and Tiny Grimes. Schinnery has also worked with backing bands and artists such as Nancy Wilson, Stanley Turrentine, David "Fathead" Newman, Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes. &lt;br /&gt;
