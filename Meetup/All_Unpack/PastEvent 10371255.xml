Let me know if you have one to loan us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/144096" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newsweek.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course carnival could mean &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carnival.com/cms/fun/promo_content/obx/dining.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.carnival.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could mean Mardi Grae though to wear those outfits of feathers and sparkles with any degree of confidence I don’t think fried foods are involved, or any food…. Just steel drums and steel abs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is about your creativity and personal interpretation.   &lt;br /&gt;Plan to cook onsite unless your recipe takes more than an hour to prepare. The fun is in the cooking here all together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting we may be out side in June, bring a lawn chair!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>my home so you will notice me and the dogs will send address a few days before</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247266955000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241827565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes June Meetup</name><id>10371255</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244847600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/10371255/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/global_8544282.jpeg</photo_url></item>
