Try something different.  Come enjoy a free concert of swing jazz and a potluck picnic with your German-speaking friends at the beautiful rose garden of Elizabeth Park. This is the oldest public rose garden in the US.  It's a really beautiful place to visit.  The music starts at 6:30 until 8:00 but people should start to arrive close to 6:00 if they can. Bring some fruit or cheese or whatever you like.  (It is a public park so the usual discretion with bottles is advised). There is free parking all over the park.  We will try to be easy to find.  If you look at the stage, the group will be back over your left shoulder close to the roses. Just listen for the German words- shouldn't be hard to find. The park is easy to find from I-84 exit 44 (Prospect Avenue).  Head north on Prospect by following the signs for the University of Hartford.  When you get to the 6th traffic light, turn left  on Asylum and then left again into the park.  &lt;br /&gt;Rain location is inside the Pond house.&lt;br /&gt;Note: this is in addition to our regular 1st &amp;amp; 3rd Thursdays, not instead of.  See you!  Bis dann!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Facing stage, look for group at back left side</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215813957000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Deutsch speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-425</urlname><id>438488</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213929711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concert and potluck picnic with German conversation!</name><id>8177061</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215640800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-425/events/8177061/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/b/global_3413819.jpeg</photo_url></item>
