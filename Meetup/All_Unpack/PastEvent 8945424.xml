When you eat it, everything tastes sweet for the next 30-40 minutes. Eat lemons, sour grapes, oranges, limes, just like they're candy. And if you eat only sort-of-sweet stuff it tastes amazing. I had fresh raspberries, and they went from just okay to the best I've ever had. You can look up more stuff at miraclefruitworld.com or google it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to do a before-and-after Miracle Fruit tasting. Basically, I'm going to have a big spread of fruit and other foods (ketchup is interesting), and try whatever you want. Since the food and miracle fruit cost me money, I'm asking everyone to either bring their own food to try or $4 to help out (on top of the usual $1 fee). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place is at my apartment's residents lounge. You'll have to call for us to open the door for you, but if you park at or around the 99 Pond lot, you're basically right at the door. I'll email my number out to those who are planning to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, if enough people are interested, we'll go to lunch at Sichuan Garden, which is just two blocks down.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call...
