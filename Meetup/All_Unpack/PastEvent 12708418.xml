All of us know someone who has suffered and possibly died from cancer, but it is especially agonizing to know a child who has to endure this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, this meetup idea is a special one, in my opinion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you have lots of crayons and crayon pieces at home, and don't know what to do with them, you'll really love this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Y Kids are Reaching Out&lt;br /&gt;March 11 3:30pm-5:30pm (come anytime within those hours, stay as little or as long as you'd like--no shopping required)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children ages 3-9 can come help peel, sort, and break crayons for melting.  These crayons will then be melted down and transformed into a variety of shapes!  Assorted &amp;quot;transformed crayons&amp;quot; are sold for a donation of $1 (or more, whatever one wants to give).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All proceeds from the &amp;quot;transformed crayons&amp;quot; will be donated to &amp;quot;Crayons for Cancer&amp;quot;, an organization raising funds for KIDS currently battling cancer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crayons for Cancer is organized right here in Manchester, CT!  It originally started here because of a little boy named Tarsh Brown, who would have been a student at Bowers Elementary School, but he died before his 4th birthday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceeds from this event go directly to the Connecticut Children's Medical Center's Family Fund, which helps parents with parking and meals to ease the debilitating costs of cancer treatments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info on this organization can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.crayonsforcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crayonsforcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.crayonsfor...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to the Little Y Kids Club near the register lines at the front of the store. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula Penna</member_name><member_id>8325760</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268512623000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1316784</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Greater Hartford Area  Parents Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267129092000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crayons for Cancer at Big Y's "Little Y Kids Club"</name><id>12708418</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268339400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group/events/12708418/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/6/global_6303910.jpeg</photo_url></item>
