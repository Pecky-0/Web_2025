The Bay Colony Dog Show is a four-day show, with each day is hosted by three prestigious New England American Kennel Club (AKC) organizations. 150 AKC breeds are represented at the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event involves a lot of standing and walking around, so comfortable shoes are recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event also features dog demonstrations, shopping and more.

Each member is responsible for their own ticket purchase at the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Providence has lots of great restaurants and coffee shops, so let's plan on getting a bite to eat afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't miss this fun event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet by the ticket purchasing area.
