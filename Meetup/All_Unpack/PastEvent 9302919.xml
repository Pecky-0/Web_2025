Please post with your RSVP what you will be bringing so that we won't have too much of the same thing.  Feel free to bring your favorite music too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meetup is at a private location, only members that have attended at least two meetup events with this group will be given the location of the event.
