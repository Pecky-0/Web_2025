<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have changed the meet up date in February from the 14th to the 7th. Saturday the 14th is Valentine's Day, as we all know. In case some of the members have plans that day I decided to bump up the date so hopefully everyone will be able to attend! Reminder to all - We hold our meet up groups rain or shine; we have spacious indoor and outdoor space available year round!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237050549000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231614878000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs February Meetup</name><id>9492819</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234029600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/9492819/</event_url></item>
