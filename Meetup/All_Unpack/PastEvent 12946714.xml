The idea for a Brunch was suggested by a few of our members so we are excited to have this new event scheduled.  You can prepare something ahead of time or just bring the ingredients and cook there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that we try to keep all dishes Vegan.  Our Potlucks are always a great success so if you havenâ€™t had an opportunity to attend one yet we look forward to seeing you on April 17th!  Please remember to RSVP and feel free to bring a friend or two.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>7947968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274549188000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269187873000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck Brunch </name><id>12946714</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271518200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/12946714/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/global_12060127.jpeg</photo_url></item>
