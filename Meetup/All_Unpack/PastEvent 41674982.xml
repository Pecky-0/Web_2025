&lt;p&gt;Because of a personal relationship with the film-maker, we are able to screen 'Finding Joe' - a documentary film about Joseph Campbell, the world famous archetypal scholar who wrote such books as "The Hero with 1,000 Faces".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See a great trailer for the film at: &lt;a href="http://findingjoethemovie.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://findingjoethemovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film is not a dry documentary - it is an exploration of the bright living color of the archetypes and the concepts of the 'Hero's Journey' that Joseph Campbell shared with the world. Great interviews with scholars from around the world, and a beautiful story woven through the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an OPEN MOVIE! Men and women are welcome, this film is also appropriate for anyone over 13. &lt;strong&gt;There is no charge for the screening, but we will gratefully accept donations to help our scholarship fund&lt;/strong&gt; and our local community. Feel free to bring popcorn &amp;amp; snacks to share and soft drinks (no alcohol, please.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will briefly introduce our OPEN MEN's Group before the screening and will stay to answer questions about the ManKind Project, the New Warrior Training Adventure (a Hero's Journey for men!) or OPEN MEN after the screening. MAXIMUM CAPACITY is 50 people - we expect that we will have a FULL HOUSE, so RSVP early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really excited about this one - it's a special movie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Boysen </member_name><member_id>7527796</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322853988000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Men</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>openmen</urlname><id>1200732</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5500030518</group_lon><name>Open Men's Group - Personal Mastery Workgroup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321658168000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>OPEN Movie Night!
