Imagine your meals without seafood. The End of the Line shows the effects of our global love affair with fish as food. It examines the imminent extinction of bluefin tuna, the impact on marine life resulting in a huge overpopulation of jellyfish and the profound implications of a future world with no fish.&lt;br /&gt;The film follows investigative reporter Charles Clover as he confronts politicians and celebrity restauranteurs who exhibit little regard for the damage they are doing to the oceans. Filmed across the world for over two years, the movie features top scientists, indigenous fishermen and fisheries enforcement officials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neaq.org/education_and_activities/programs_and_classes/aquarium_lecture_series/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Aquarium lecture series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can meetup after the movie as there will be a cash bar reception at the aquarium immediately following the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send my cell the day of the event to all yes and maybes.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside IMAX theatre lobby.
