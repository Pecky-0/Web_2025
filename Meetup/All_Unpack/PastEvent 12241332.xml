(thanks Debbie) The gifts were awesome and everyone, I think, got what they wanted, except for Larry who gave me his gift :(   Thank you!   There was Rum Cake, Flowers, Candy, and free coffee for all  :)   and lots of skunking going on  :( &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people, including myself, also got &amp;quot;yodel pickled&amp;quot; until Larry got mad and we put it away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ellen was kind enough to take lots and lots of photos of this F*U*N event!!
