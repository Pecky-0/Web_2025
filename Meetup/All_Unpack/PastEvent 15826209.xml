So in light of the snow and if you care to venture outside, there is parking (hopefully plowed) and it's a direct shot on streets that will probably be plowed. So you're a little egg-nogged out, you indulged a little too much over the Holidays...who cares! Come out and and have some fun. In the snow, no less!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This is a fave by many Collective members  - moi included - so walk, drive, and get yourself to this cozy little oasis on the far east side! The Waterman Grille is at the end of Waterman Ave. in Richmond Square  - all the way at the end of Waterman Ave. So at the end, you may have never seen it, but its a gem. If you've ever driven over the Henderson Bridge to East Providence, aka The Red Bridge, you've probably seen it on the right (at least you can' t miss the pink building).  So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll find us, we're hard to miss!
