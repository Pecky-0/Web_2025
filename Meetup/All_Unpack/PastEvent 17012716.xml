&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's have a discussion and discovery about this.&amp;nbsp; Often when we look at something from a different point of view, we see things we did not notice before. The same is true about cluttering - be that physical or mental. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Martin&lt;/strong&gt;, a practicing certified hypnotherapist and    neurolinguistic programming (NLP) Practitioner, is back to offer more pointers and frameworks  for QUICKLY (on a  scale of MINUTES- NOT months or years...so, practically magic: like a "Gestalt  switch") "reprogram" our lives to live &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; cluttered thinking, for more successful, satisfying living- particularly regarding finances or other considerations of special value to us. As organizer  of   several Boston-area NLP Meetups, Kevin originally envisioned his   groups would help people learn self-help tools. He often looks for    resources, tools, and groups outside the fields of hypnosis and NLP to    mesh with that vision -and fortunately, our group does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;If you plan to eat, please arrive by 6:30 pm to order&lt;/strong&gt;; otherwise, by 7 pm will be fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;There is no specified purchase minimum for refreshments,  but participants are encouraged to order &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;thing to support the  business, in appreciation of Management's permission to meet in their space.&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Please be advised: Commercial eating establishments generally do &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; permit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on-site &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;consumption of refreshments brought in from elsewhere, due  to liability concerns, so please be considerate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:45 pm- Wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; Calendar to schedule Action Items  (next  steps), notepad &amp;amp; pen  or other note-taking device.  Dress in  layers (e.g., wear a sweater in  case the restaurant is cooler  than  you'd prefer) and comfortably, as  Kevin might have us all do  NLP/EFT  exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one recent "case study" I can offer in rediscovering Value that I had overlooked routinely in the seeming clutter within my home: while putting back decorative knick knacks on some kitchen corner shelves following a painter's visit last week, I found myself  on autopilot returning to the shelves some liqueurs in their interesting little bottles ...  when it occurred to me they'd been up there for &lt;em&gt; decades&lt;/em&gt; and I had no plans to invite people for dinner or dessert anytime soon, so I thought to myself, why not use these &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, myself- at the very least to further my decluttering objectives?&amp;nbsp; The result has been &lt;em&gt;delightful:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;I now drizzle fresh cut fruit  with amaretto or Grand Marnier, creating luscious concoctions for evening snacks!&amp;nbsp; You can do something similar, I'm sure ... just think:&amp;nbsp; how might &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; achieve a simple "clutter Victory" - this very weekend - perhaps by utilizing something you've been saving for a special time or person(s) that never materialized (and very possibly won't)? (For decades I'd served guests desserts &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; fruit in liqueur- so, I totally forgot I even had these ingredients on hand!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thought, loosely related ... more philosophical: in society, income comes from or through at least one other &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; with whom we've somehow interacted, perhaps indirectly, at some point. Finance is &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; ... so, perhaps the "Social Growth" subject that's been at least noted and tracked (is it still?), if not graded in elementary schools, might well be relabeled to better reflect the valuable financial aspect of human interaction, too? -to expand people's awareness of the broader  significance of "social growth," even at an early age...to not seem so much a "throw-away  subject" as kids such as I was might otherwise consider it to be. Life can be a hard master in the subject later on, if such lessons &lt;em&gt; aren't &lt;/em&gt;learned early...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come join us!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; (Or specify a better time and place for you to do so; we'll try to schedule another meeting soon.)&amp;nbsp; Share your ideas and achievements- let's have some **FUN** with this, Guys!!&lt;/p&gt;
