SPECIAL ANNOUCMENT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to the generous members whom donated to the MSPCA holiday drive hosted by Doggie Day.&lt;br /&gt; It?s official. I am proud to announce that not only did the Chihuahua group make a significant donation to help pets in need. WE WON!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I thought the Yorkie?s had it!  However, every bit made the difference and to all those who gave, regardless of how much you donated. Thank you so much for your kindness. Stay tuned for pictures. I think everyone will be astounded by the portion of items that were so graciously given.&lt;br /&gt;Your kindness made it possible. As a reward, Doggie Day (and of course meetup man of the week Rob Galeski) will once again be extending his generosity back to us and as a thank you for everyone?s goodness, all those who donated from the Boston Chihuahua Group will have a party hosted in their honor on Sunday, January 14, 2007 to ring in the New Year. Again please note: The event will replace the morning meet up and will MEET AT DOGGIE DAY PLAYCENTER AT 5-7PM!&lt;br /&gt; I hope that all those who donated will attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****For those who have already rsvp?d for Paws for a cause, that meetup will be held as usual during the morning session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again and Happy Holidays.  ---Susana &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locations:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.
