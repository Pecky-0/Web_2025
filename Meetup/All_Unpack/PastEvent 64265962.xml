&lt;p&gt;We'll be pedaling on the scenic roads of Concord &amp;amp; Carlisle, for a 20 mile route of rolling hills and picturesque views. We'll aim for an average of 12-15 MPH, nothing too intense for this early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meetup at Monument Square at 8:45am, we'll say hello, I'll pass out cue sheets, and we'll hit the road no later than 9:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have NOT been out riding at all this year, please make sure your bike is tuned up, tires inflated, and ready to ride... we want to avoid hardware malfunctions if possible. I recommend a road bike for this ride, but if you can keep that pace on a different style bike, then that's fine by me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are driving to the meetup spot, you can find street parking on many of the streets near monument square. In the past, I have done very well finding spots on Lexington Road, across from the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
