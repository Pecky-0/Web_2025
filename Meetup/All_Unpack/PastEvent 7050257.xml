It is the other Chris (the not-quite-as-cool-but-still-pretty-rad Chris).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are kicking it at the regular time and the regular place this week: Tuesday, 7 PM, Cambridge Common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is it, the New Year, or something? What's with all the new people? Resolutions? A quick shout out to all the newcomers (Arlene, Sean(Shawn?), Mary, AnyoneElseI'mForgetting)! It's absolutely spectacular to see fresh faces out on the field -- I was getting pretty sick of the regulars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna Newsom has something to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We thought our very hearts would up and melt away&lt;br /&gt;From that snow in the nighttime.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're right, Joanna, but our hearts aren't the only things melting away in the nighttime. My friends, the snow! Have you looked at the weather report for this week? Let me spell it out for you: 50°,  53°, 52°, 43°, 47°. So, once again: the snow! It'll be withering and wallowing in its own dirty mess by the time the Sun is done beating it into submission. And it will dilute and burrow into the ground and emerge as a fun brown substance we all love to play in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day (back when I was cool), I used to play a little game called &amp;quot;Ultimate Strip Mud Soccer.&amp;quot; (Use your imagination.) While there won't be any stripping, or soccer, all is not lost, don't you worry. We still have &amp;quot;Ultimate Mud.&amp;quot; And that's all we need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of newcomers, if you have never shown up to a game before, &lt;b&gt;now's the time&lt;/b&gt;! Kick back with the cool kids and play a little frisbee. It'll be &lt;b&gt;fifty degrees&lt;/b&gt;, how can you not? It doesn't matter if you've never touched a frisbee in your life -- you'll learn! We are a friendly and good looking bunch of strangers. Well, I am, at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, come one, come all. Bring water, cleats (if you have 'em), light-colored clothing, and smiles and puppies and kittens (oh my!) We always go out for food and drinks after the game, so money would be great to bring too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your assistant organizer and thin mint,&lt;br /&gt;Chris&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hen&lt;br /&gt;Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the light-up discs and short shorts.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim O'Neill</member_name><member_id>4585507</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelli</member_name><member_id>4908325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214939046000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199679697000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ultimate Mud Frisbee on Cambridge Common</name><id>7050257</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199836800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7050257/</event_url></item>
