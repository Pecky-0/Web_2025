And the dog is a very active and very large puppy, but I'll ask the teenager to keep him downstairs in the family room, so we can all avoid the 70 pound lap dog!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257723323000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253496536000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a meeting</name><id>11423090</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257550200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/11423090/</event_url></item>
