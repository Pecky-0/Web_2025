Proceeds go to South Windsor Bark Park and/or Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation. We need volunteers throughout the day. We need people to help set up bright and early in the morning through the clean up at the end of the day. This is a family friendly and dog friendly event. This year we have expanded to incorporate the bottom fields as well. There will be live entertainment, dog contests throughout the day, a moon bounce and spin art for the kids. Various vendors and food as well. Did I mention LOTS of dogs?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reply please indicate which shift you are available for. 7:30-noon or 11:30-4p or all day so that we may plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Petrillo</member_name><member_id>8764866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368584916000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364346952000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paws in the Park</name><id>111233242</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>30600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368271800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/111233242/</event_url></item>
