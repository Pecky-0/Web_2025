&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, July 3, Lee USA Speedway is having a NASCAR race, Monster Trucks and FMX -Games (motocross).  I've already spoken with the marketing manager at the track letting him know that at least 25 of us would be interested in attending : &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $25 each, we get a pit pass which gives us FULL ACCESS to the pits, the cars and their drivers.  And when we get exhausted from all the excitement, we get to sit in the NASCAR box which I believe is the box closest to the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing manager, Bob, suggested that the track photographer (at the track since 1976), meet with us first to talk about where we can and can't go that evening.  Since the "Pit Party" begins at 5, I'm assuming it will be about 4:45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I will be really hungry (and possibly thirsty) after seeing all this racing so I suggest we go to the Holy Grail (an old church that's now a bar) for dinner/beer afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  In support of "higher education" - it states this on the web site - there is a school bus monster truck.  Check it out ... it's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cell phone:  603-812-5112.  Looking forward to this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
