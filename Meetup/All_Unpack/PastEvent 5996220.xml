Coordination with regional RP Meetup groups: They're springing up fast - we need to set up regular communications with them so we're all working together. A stated goal of a large regional meetup (with Ron Paul invited) is certainly feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Group efforts: We need suggestions from everyone, we've doubled members since the first meetup. Some folks are better at the &amp;quot;door to door&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;phone call&amp;quot; type stuff and some are more comfortable contributing in other ways. Does anyone have good ideas for meetups or events in the future, such as a &amp;quot;sign party&amp;quot;? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Fundraising: Inventory of current pamphlets, bumper stickers, DVD's, etc. Do we want to do a bulk rate purchase for certain materials? Regular fund raisers would keep our resources up - this is how we can be ready for events on short notice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Upcoming events: there are many things coming up, (including the Apple Harvest Parade, Plainville Air Balloon Festival, more religious festivals, etc.) that we need to make decisions on. Which ones will have the most positive exposure for Ron Paul? What are costs when factored in? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other ideas / discussion points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacting local media:  the continued lack of major media coverage concerning Ron Paul's very strong grass-roots support needs to end. It would be harder to pretend we don't exist if we'd all pen a short&lt;br /&gt;letter to the local paper and/or station.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volunteering: Does anyone have VOIP or a good long distance plan on their phone? Do you have the time and means to call as many voters as possible during your free time? This is how we get the straw poll numbers up and help boost name recognition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185059119000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183999348000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tolland County CT July Ron Paul Meetup</name><id>5996220</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184886000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/5996220/</event_url></item>
