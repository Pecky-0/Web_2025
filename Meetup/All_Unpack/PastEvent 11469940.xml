The party starts at 8pm and ends officially at 12noon. However there is usually an after party that follows downstairs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that there may be a dance lesson before the event. I will update the event as I learn any news.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover at the door is $15 and $10 if tickets are purchased in advance. &lt;br /&gt;There are phone numbers listed on the image if you like call about advance purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a few of us in the group that are taking Forro dance classes, and this would be a great opportunity for us to practice what we have learned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those who want to practicePortuguese, the majority attending these events are native speakers, so this would be a good opportunity for you to speak and also have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who do not know Forro, it is a really fun music/dance from the northeast of Brazil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear comfortable dancing shoes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256617212000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253941334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forró at Benfica</name><id>11469940</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256428800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/11469940/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/2/8/global_10895672.jpeg</photo_url></item>
