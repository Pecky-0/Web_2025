<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come join us this Friday night at one of my favorite venues in Boston - 33!  This posh, two floor lounge/club has great DJs and atmosphere.  A fun place to meet new people and to get your groove on!  All members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 9pm in the hotel bar at Jurys Hotel (350 Stuart St, off Berkeley St) The downstairs hotel bar is called Cuffs, but the Jurys logo is easier to find.  We will head over to 33 around 10pm to beat the lines.  The line starts to build by 10:30pm, so please meet us before 10pm, as you may not find us later.  Expected cover: $0. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;33 is an upscale venue, so please dress appropriately.  If traveling by T, 33 is located near the Copley T stop on the green line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
