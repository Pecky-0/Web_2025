My main goal is to play Gonzaga at least once more along with the new Uwe Rosenberg title At the Gates of Loyang. Plenty of other games on hand, so I hope you'll swing by to play. Start time is noon, and we'll likely play until 7-8 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP with an arrival time if you're in, and feel free to suggest games that you want to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257787064000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257308417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>11790025</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257613200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/11790025/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
