We will use the first hour of the meeting to celebrate anything and everything related to the holiday season and trading. Had a good year in the Markets? We'll celebrate! Had a bad year? We'll commiserate! You get the idea. We will eat in the lounge area outside Room 315. Use the time to network, pick the brains of your fellow traders and introduce yourself to some of the members you haven't yet met. Please fill out a name tag and wear it. And remember - we do want to celebrate responsibly. I don't want anyone driving home intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; font-size : large"&gt;Market Talk by Basil Chapman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We will have a market talk. Basil Chapman of Chapman Wave and Tiger Financial Network will present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; font-size : medium"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
