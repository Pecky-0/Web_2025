The first day of Spring is this Saturday, and as of today the weather looks pretty good!  Lets hit the scenic roads of Concord &amp;amp; Carlisle, for a 20 mile route of rolling hills and picturesque views.  We'll aim for an average of 12-15 MPH, nothing too intense for this early in the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meetup at Monument Square at 10:15, we'll say hello, I'll pass out cue sheets, and we'll hit the road no later than 10:30.  We'll aim to be back to the starting place around lunchtime and anyone who wants to stick around and join me for a bite to eat at Main Streets Cafe is more than welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/482869/Monument%20Sq%20Meet-Up%20Spot.jpg"&gt;Link to Meetup Spot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=42.511083,-71.34676&amp;amp;spn=0.102244,0.222988&amp;amp;z=13&amp;amp;msid=102779203779063114278.000481e1215f8aaa2f2a2"&gt;Link to Route Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have NOT been out riding at all this year, please make sure your bike is tuned up and ready to ride... we want to avoid hardware malfunctions if possible.  I recommend a road bike for this ride, but if you can keep that pace on a different style bike, then hey, that'll work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are driving to the meetup spot, you can find street parking on many of the streets near monument square.  In the past, I have done very well finding spots on Lexington Road, across from the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;- Jon&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy handing out cue sheets</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon Ramos</member_name><member_id>4466935</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270307701000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268705272000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>20 Mile Ride: Concord &amp; Carlisle</name><id>12887165</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269094500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/12887165/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/3/global_13693107.jpeg</photo_url></item>
