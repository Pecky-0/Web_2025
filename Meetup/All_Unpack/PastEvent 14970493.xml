Let's plant some trees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join P-Collective member and neighborhood tree-planting leader Christopher in the West Broadway/Westminster/Armory section of the West Side on Saturday, October 9th to participate in a Providence Neighborhood Planting Program event to benefit the neighborhood between Broadway and Westminster streets. Alongside neighborhood residents, we will help plant 20 trees to beautify the neighborhood and enhance the existing streetscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;12:00pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at 42 Harkness Street for a demonstration by the PNPP and the Providence City Forestry staff on how to plant the trees correctly and then we'll fan out through the neighborhood to help the residents with their plantings. Please note, it is &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that we are there for the demonstration to participate in the planting, so we will be meeting at noon. The demonstration will be around 12:15pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear appropriate clothing - sturdy shoes or boots are necessary and gloves are highly recommended. If you have access to a shovel, pruners, or a saw - please bring them along. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our first volunteer event! -So come out, spend a few hours helping beautify our beloved city, enjoy a fall afternoon in the sun, and let's have some fun! After the Tree Planting we'll head over to Louie Fuller's, E &amp;amp; O, Julian's or the Avery for some after-planting socializing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info on PNPP: &lt;a href="http://www.pnpp.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pnpp.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Depending on the weather - I will be wearing blue jeans and a fushia fleece</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
