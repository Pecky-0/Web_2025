I have posted a poll that will close in one week, this way you will still have a month after the poll decision to read the book. I look forward to meeting the members that I don't already know, and to have a great year of interesting reads! Feel free to contact me if you have questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thx,&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Just as a note: I will be continuing the current practice of asking for $1 from each member at the meetings.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will put a small table sign out, but if it helps I am short with brown hair.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264377265000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229485576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Book Meetup - The Tipping Point (Malcolm Gladwell)</name><id>9351114</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232913600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/9351114/</event_url></item>
