&lt;p&gt;...It would be great &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they eventually could launch a &lt;em&gt;Cluttering&lt;/em&gt; Research Project to feed into their Hoarding Research Project (since some of us might be on a path toward hoarding), and offer &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; meetings (as well as some meetings for a fee?  -Whatever proves to draw the most people to meetings!), which I can no longer afford to do ... we might meet in restaurants at some mealtimes to discuss issues over a lunch or supper, but restaurants prefer (and sometimes require) meeting participants to pay for some refreshments in exchange for our use of their public space and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some information about B.U.'s work in the area of clutter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comments on how best to learn from one or another academic department's research in this area of interest to us &lt;span&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; are welcomed- along with suggestions of when and where we might best meet to consider some such positive evolutions in our group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;
