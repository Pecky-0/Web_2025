<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is starting to be a monthly get together for those interested in Bollywood movies.  I am trying for the 3rd Sunday.  I am changing the time to 6 pm.  That way there is more time to talk after the movie.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We watched a horror movie last time.  This time we are looking for something more light hearted with singing and dancing.  If you have anything like that bring it and we all vote on the movie to watch that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no theme for the pot luck aspect.  Edible food if you really need a theme.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY.  I don't have a car on the weekends, so it will be empty.  Feel free to take the prime space.  Knock and enter.. don't worry about waiting for me to get to the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;List of seen movies seen so far:&lt;br /&gt;Saawariya &lt;br /&gt;Bhoot&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253745768000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250959578000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bollywood Potluck - #3</name><id>11172564</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253484000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/11172564/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/8/global_9344168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
