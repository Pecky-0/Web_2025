&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The King's Speech on the &lt;strong&gt;BIG SCREEN&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;The Coolidge Corner Theater, 290 Harvard Street, Brookline, MA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps you've already seen The King's Speech, I have, but this is a film that has made history.&amp;nbsp; The director, writer, cinematographers, actors, editors, designers, crews, gaffers et al exceed the sum of their parts.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Even more amazing is that its not the only film nominated this year that has done so.&amp;nbsp; Still, we can only see one film at a time and this one is playing in one of our favorite venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Travers writes in Rolling Stone:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The King's Speech plays out on the battlefield of words, not action. Writer David Seidler (doing keenly insightful work partly owing to his own bouts with a stammer) had conceived the story first as a play. Before you can think the words "static" and "confining," be advised that director Tom Hooper, garlanded with Emmy dust for John Adams, Elizabeth I, Longford and Prime Suspect, breathes fresh, urgent life into every frame of this powerhouse. Hooper, 37, is a prodigious talent. The emotion this film produces is staggering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not plan to come to both dinner and the film, please let me know your exact plans.&amp;nbsp; Probably a good idea to purchase tickets earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note also&amp;nbsp;that RSVPs stop at 3:00 pm to give Zenna Noodle consideration in accommodating us.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYATM, Betsey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
