There will be two courts available for play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate - Players with firm understanding of game  strategy.    Should have a good grasp of skills (passing, setting,  hitting). Play in   this game should consistently be bump-set-spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is intended to be approximately Yankee C- level or equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  entrance to the gym is on Cambridge Street opposite Harvard    Market. The  nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street    and Roberts  Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:  &lt;br /&gt;* Please RSVP if you plan on attending.  If you show up at the  game    but do not have a "Yes" RSVP, you will not be guaranteed to get    playing  time.  &lt;br /&gt;* Please be serious about RSVP's. If you RSVP "Yes"    and  don't show up, it means you have prevented someone else from    attending.  Also, please change your RSVP if you find out you can't   play,  as soon  as possible. Changing the RSVP a few hours before the   game time  means  that there will be less people who can play, as most   people  prefer some  advance notice that there are spots available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  cost of the meetup will be $5. Please pay the organizer when you    arrive  before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of    the court  rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk from the T stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking  near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as    meters and  residential parking rules are generally not enforced on    Sundays (parking  signs should say "EX SUNDAY" or similar).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>6614402</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307486124000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306873373000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Intermediate Indoor Volleyball</name><id>20406421</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307296800000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/20406421/</event_url></item>
