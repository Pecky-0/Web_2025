Show time is 6:50.   Looks like it is showing upstairs, so I will try to snag a table at the top of the escalators, if you get there before me, please grab a table.   See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, since we see movies opening weekend, it is a very good idea to buy tickets ahead of time...especially if it is a big name movie. I have run a few meetups this summer where some people came, but could not get into the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup badge. Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me. I generally get there about an hour before the show and the group heads in for seats about 30 minutes before hand. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: September 3, 2010&lt;br /&gt;Studio: New Line Cinema (Warner Bros.)&lt;br /&gt;Director: Nanette Burstein&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Geoff LaTulippe&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Drew Barrymore, Justin Long, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis, Ron Livingston, Jim Gaffigan, Kelli Garner, Rob Riggle, Christina Applegate&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://going-the-distance.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://going-the-dist...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Erin's (Drew Barrymore) wry wit and unfiltered frankness charm newly single Garrett (Justin Long) over beer, bar trivia and breakfast the next morning. Their chemistry sparks a full-fledged summer fling, but neither expects it to last once Erin heads home to San Francisco and Garrett stays behind for his job in New York City. But when six weeks of romping through the city inadvertently become meaningful, neither is sure they want it to end. And while Garrett's friends, Box (Jason Sudeikis) and Dan (Charlie Day), joke about his pre-flight calorie cutting and his full-time relationship with his cell phone, they don't like losing their best drinking buddy to yet another rocky romance. At the same time, Erin's high-strung, overprotective married sister, Corrine (Christina Applegate), wants to keep Erin from heading down an all-too-familiar road. But despite the opposite coasts, the nay-saying friends and family, and a few unexpected temptations, the couple just might have found something like love, and with the help of a lot of texting, sexting and late-night phone calls, they might actually go the distance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Meetup Badge.
