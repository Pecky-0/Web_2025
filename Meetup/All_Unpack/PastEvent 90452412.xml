&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stupidest Angel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Christopher Moore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say "Kris Kringle," he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move over, Charles Dickens -- it's Christopher Moore time.&lt;/p&gt;
