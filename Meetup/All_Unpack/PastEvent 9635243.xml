We'll start with dinner at the Waterstreet Cafe, a Mediterranean-themed restaurant in Fall River.  I made a reservation for 7:30pm.  Afterwards, we will move over to their bar area to see The Express, a fun band I have seen a few times (my co-worker is the keyboard player).  The Express plays a mix of rock and popular cover tunes, and there is always a group of people dancing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Website for Waterstreet Cafe: &lt;a href="http://www.waterstreetcafe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.waterstree...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available on the street including in a semi-lot across the way.  The area is a little tricky to get around in but it is right near Battleship Cove.&lt;br /&gt;Website for The Express: &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/theexpressmusic" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a $7 cover for the band, which goes on at 9:30.  If you eat dinner in the restaurant first they will give you a drink coupon for the show, but you still need to pay the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please indicate in your reservation whether you are coming for dinner or just for the band.&lt;/u&gt;  This is a joint event between the South Shore 30+ Singles Group, South Shore Hike, Bike, etc. group, and Wings.  Please RSVP to ONE group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send out my cell number the day before to YES replies.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the entrance/Reservation under Trina</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234225999000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233336134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and music with The Express in Fall River</name><id>9635243</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234053000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/9635243/</event_url></item>
