We will start the group by listening to a audio talk by Richard Shankman on the role of Samadhi in the four foundations of mindfulness. Richard Shankman has been a meditator since 1970 and teaches at dharma centers and groups throughout the Bay Area. He is a co-founder of the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies and the Community Partnership for Mindfulness in Education, and the author of The Experience of Samadhi: An In-Depth Investigation of Buddhist Meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included will be a discussion of the talk, a short meditation and a time to set intentions for the coming week. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274826361000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274017824000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Richard Shankman - The Role of Samadhi</name><id>qmmdnynhbgc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274738400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/13497778/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
