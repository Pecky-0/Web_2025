Hike a couple small trails in Plainfield, NH (French Ledges and Farnum Lot....see link). Go to a new and used ski sale at Kimball Union Academy in their auditorium (9-3pm..we'll be there early), and wrap it up with brunch at Jesse's. Looking at the attached link, we'll meet at the Parking lot that goes to both trails (Farnum and Frenchs) at 8am. We'll do Farnum first (8-8:40), Frenchs second (8:45-9:30). We'll hit the ski sale 9:40-10:30, then Jesses' at 1045. A little bit for everyone. If you want to attend just a part or two, mention that in the comments or your response so we don't wait for you (probably wouldn't do that anyway, but giving you the illusion that we would will make everyone feel better!) &lt;a href="http://www.uvtrails.org/sites/uvtrails.org/files/field_trail_map/frenchs_ledges.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.uvtrails.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320030979000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319254214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike (PlainfieldNH), Ski Sale (Meridien, NH), Brunch(Lebanon)</name><id>38280562</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319976000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/38280562/</event_url></item>
