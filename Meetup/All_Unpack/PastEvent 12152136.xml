It has won Tonys, Obies and dozens of other awards. This is the musical that got people going to the theatre again. I saw it twice in Boston, and would see it a hundred times more -- it was my favorite musical until Wicked came along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, tickets are pretty pricey, but the Orpheum Theatre in Foxboro is putting it on for $24/ticket. I usher here occasionally, and their productions are very good. Orpheum is a community theatre in Mass., about 20 minutes from Providence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RENT is a rock musical with music and lyrics by Jonathan Larson based on La Boh√®me. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York's Lower East Side in the thriving days of Bohemian Alphabet City, under the shadow of AIDS. There's a lot more information on the official &lt;a href="http://www.siteforrent.com/abouttheshow" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Here are some videos:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MS4OZUqH9A&amp;amp;feature=related" target="_blank"&gt;La Vie Boheme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Nvl9of59A&amp;amp;feature=related" target="_blank"&gt;Seasons of Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8EoKhm7KFQ&amp;amp;feature=related" target="_blank"&gt;Out Tonight &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;b&gt;Please RSVP by 5 pm, Friday, Jan. 8 and pay through this site&lt;/b&gt;. Tickets are $24 + somewhat lower handling fees = $27. This one will sell out early. If I can't get enough tickets, I will refund your money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because parking is pretty limited around the theatre in Foxboro, I am open to carpooling from Providence. We can meet at Providence Place Mall, and then after the show, have dinner/drinks/apps at &lt;a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu/welcome/Welcome" target="_blank"&gt;Cheesecake Factory&lt;/a&gt; in the mall. Or you can meet us in Foxboro if you wish. Please put a note in the RSVP comments if you want to carpool, and I will email you with details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 8 pm, and we will plan to meet at the theatre by 7:15 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is going to be awesome!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby at 7:15 pm</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265675015000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261923460000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RENT - Orpheum Theatre Foxboro</name><id>12152136</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265501700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/12152136/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/6/global_12393398.jpeg</photo_url></item>
