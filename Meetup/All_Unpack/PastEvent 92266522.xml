&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia, September 26, 1928 &lt;br /&gt;

 Coppone Released From Prison!! &lt;br /&gt;

 Chicago gang leader Harold "Hal" Coppone was released today from Awsume State Penitentiary near Philadelphia after serving a six-month term. Coppone, who was jailed for carrying an unlicensed weapon, was met by a group of his men - among them was Chicago gangster Joey "The Rattlesnake" Ratello, chief suspect in the recent killing of Marco "Machete" Molino - and departed quickly in a powerful seven-passenger Lincoln Touring car. While he had nothing to say to the press, Coppone and his men were undoubtedly headed back to Chicago where, it is rumored, they have more than one score to settle.&lt;/p&gt;
