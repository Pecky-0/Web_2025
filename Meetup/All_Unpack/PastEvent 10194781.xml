The entrance to the boat ramp is at the traffic light at the intersection of Rt. 20 and Edgemere Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll paddle through the pond and into Lake Quinsigammond.  We will be on the water for approximately 2 hours.  There is a crew race on the lake that day which will prevent us from going all the way up the lake, but between the pond and the southern section of the lake, there is plenty of area to cover!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminder - PFDs are required for all kayaking/canoeing events (not to mention at this time of year they are required by law to be worn).  The water will be very cold, so dry or wet suits strongly recommended for this trip.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241370120000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239842877000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle at Flint Pond, Shrewsbury</name><id>10194781</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240678800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/10194781/</event_url></item>
