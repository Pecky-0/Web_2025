In our Western society, these aspects are sometimes unknown, overlooked, and undervalued, as compared to the well-practiced masculine aspects of reasoning and logic. The Divine Feminine is an integral tool that each person ? man or woman ? has to make decisions, to access new ideas, and to create a life filled with wisdom, knowledge, and truth.  This seminar will give you an experience of the workings of the Divine Feminine within yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** a light lunch will be served **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher. Currently, he serves as Co-Director of the Order of Christ Sophia, teaching and ministering to his spiritual students, and guiding thirteen Centers of Light and their ministers around the country. He travels between these Centers year-round, teaching and lecturing, as well as performing his music as a singer-songwriter of Mystical Christian folk rock. Many of the elements of the Mystical Christian teachings can be heard and experienced in Father Peter's music, encouraging the listener to seek and discover the Truth within.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Center of Light in Jamaica Plain is located just around the corner from the Stony Brook T stop on the Orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210601270000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206766724000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Divine Feminine:  Following Your Intuition</name><id>7625728</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210428000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/7625728/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/8/global_1017208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
