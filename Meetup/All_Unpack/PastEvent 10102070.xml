It's quite another to resell or &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; the property for a profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of if you've picked up a property from a motivated seller directly, or you've worked with the bank to do a short sale, you have to move the property after you buy it to make a profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At our May 7th &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ForeclosuresMass.com/ttk/" target="_blank"&gt;Turning the Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, local attorney &lt;b&gt;Burton Kliman&lt;/b&gt; will be going over how to resell your properties for a profit, the problems you can face in struturing the transaction, and how you can take title and move it onto the end buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attorney Burt Kliman has been working with Banks and Investors on short sales long before they became so popular. He regularly counsels asset management companies on loss mitigation strategies, essentially helping these companies develop the legal and analytical framework for alternatives to foreclosures. He also works with Investors (and is counsel to some of our more active investors here at ForeclosuresMass) helping them to successfully short sale and resale distressed assets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At our May 7th Turning the Key meeting, Attorney Kliman will share with you:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why &amp;quot;Flipping&amp;quot; is out and &amp;quot;Reselling for Profit&amp;quot; is in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;What you should know about doing short sales in this market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why it makes more sense financially for the bank to approve your short sale, and how to convince them to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to properly structure your resale transactions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mystery behind double closings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How you can take title and move it to the end buyer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 5 pitfalls of &amp;quot;flipping&amp;quot; and how to avoid them. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Seating is Limited and pre-registration is HIGHLY recommended!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$45 at the Door (no exceptions) • $15 for Pre-Registrations • $10 for Pre-Registered Members • FREE for TTK Pass Holders. &lt;a href="http://www.ForeclosuresMass.com/ttk/" target="_blank"&gt;Pre-Register Online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&amp;lt;-- Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 3372062</member_name><member_id>3372062</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>3494542</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kirsten, ForeclosuresMass</member_name><member_id>6575727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242678614000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Serious Real Estate Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonreia</urlname><id>358354</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Real Estate Networking/Education Meeting in Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238715915000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TTK: Why Flipping is OUT and Reselling for Profit is IN</name><id>10102070</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241735400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonreia/events/10102070/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/3/c/global_791180.jpeg</photo_url></item>
