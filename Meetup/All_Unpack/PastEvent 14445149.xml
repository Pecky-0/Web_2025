<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;i&gt;Feed&lt;/i&gt; by M.T. Anderson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brilliantly ironic satire is set in a future world where television and computers are connected directly into people's brains when they are babies. The result is a chillingly recognizable consumer society where empty-headed kids are driven by fashion and shopping and the avid pursuit of silly entertainment--even on trips to Mars and the moon--and by constant customized murmurs in their brains of encouragement to buy, buy, buy. &lt;br /&gt;Anderson gives us this world through the voice of a boy who, like everyone around him, is almost completely inarticulate, whose vocabulary, in a dead-on parody of the worst teenspeak, depends heavily on three words: &amp;quot;like,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thing,&amp;quot; and the second most common English obscenity. He's even made this vapid kid a bit sympathetic, as a product of his society who dimly knows something is missing in his head. The details are bitterly funny--the idiotic but wildly popular sitcom called &amp;quot;Oh? Wow! Thing!&amp;quot;, the girls who have to retire to the ladies room a couple of times an evening because hairstyles have changed, the hideous lesions on everyone that are not only accepted, but turned into a fashion statement. And the ultimate awfulness is that when we finally meet the boy's parents, they are just as inarticulate and empty-headed as he is, and their solution to their son's problem is to buy him an expensive car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286019910000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>thatotherbookgroup</urlname><id>1149392</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>That Other Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282009754000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Feed</name><id>14445149</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285282800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/thatotherbookgroup/events/14445149/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/b/global_17270859.jpeg</photo_url></item>
