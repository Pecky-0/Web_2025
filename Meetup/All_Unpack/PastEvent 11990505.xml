The snow isn't supposed to start until a little later in the evening, so come hang out for a couple of hours!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you can join your fellow Newcomers at this year's holiday party hosted by McFadden's. There will be food, drink, and most importantly, fun! Members may stay at McFadden's to dance the night away, or venture off to hit up area bars after the party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have the private room at McFadden's from 7:30pm to 11pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cost of the event is $5&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;This is mainly to cover food costs as we will be pre-ordering a few appetizer platters. You can vote for what you would like &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/polls/215876/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yankee Swap (optional)&lt;/b&gt; - will start around 9pm&lt;br /&gt;Based on the success of last years fun, we're bringing back the exciting &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange"&gt;Yankee Swap/White Elephant Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to participate in the White Elephant Exchange/Yankee Swap, bring one small gift wrapped item without labels that costs $10 or less. Everyone who brings a gift will be eligible to participate in one of the most interesting and potentially fun gift exchanges ever seen. At the end of the exchange, every participant gets one gift to take home, however, it may not be the fit that was opened, as a bit of &amp;quot;stealing&amp;quot; can occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examples of good items: bad movies on DVD, amusing books, gift cards, novelty bottle openers, (almost anything from Oop!), small toys.

If you decide to participate, please bring &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;unwrapped&lt;/i&gt; toys as they will be distributed as Christmas gifts to needy children in the community.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We have reserved the private room from 7:30pm to 11pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262034186000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>49</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259686087000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Party at McFadden's</name><id>11990505</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261269000000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11990505/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
