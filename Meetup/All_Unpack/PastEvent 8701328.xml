<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is an out-and-back style hike (may loop depending on conditions and temperament) where we'll hike about 4.5 hours max. I figure about 5 - 6 miles of hiking. Exact trail will depend on conditions. We'll hike mostly on the white blaze trail on the way out, which is the toughest and most interesting part with cliffs and peaks with views at times. It runs the spine of the giant (see map).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike would start from the trailhead off of the paved parking lot across from Quinnipiac University. The hike would be moderate to a bit higher difficulty with a fair amount of up/down on the trail and a respectable length.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot at 9 AM.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear boots as it WILL be muddy after the rains! Bring a quart of water and some trail food/lunch for energy. Good idea to have a daypack to stow water and snack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions via MapQuest for paved parking lot off Mt.
