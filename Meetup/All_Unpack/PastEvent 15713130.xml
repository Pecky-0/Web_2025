We'll be playing the gothic victorian horror board game Arkham Horror, heavily based on the Cthulhu Mythos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia's article (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Horror):" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Players take on the role of investigators in H. P. Lovecraft's Massachusetts town of Arkham. Gates to other planes open throughout the town. If too many gates open, a powerful alien being will enter, likely destroying the town and possibly threatening the world. The investigators must avoid or fight alien creatures that enter Arkham through the gates, enter the gates themselves, survive the alien places beyond, return to Arkham, and close the gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this game is notorious for taking a LONG time to play through, so while we aim to start right at 6 and should have enough time to finish, there's a chance that we won't.  The intent here is to offer an opportunity to play the game, try out the mechanics, live a part of the Cthulhu story, and most importantly, have some fun while trying to avoid insanity and institutionalization.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293131431000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292180685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arkham Horror</name><id>15713130</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292454000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15713130/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
