&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have to leave &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;no later&lt;/span&gt; than 2:30pm in order to get to the bus for my daughter. If this time works for you then please join me to&amp;nbsp;finish up any projects you're making, work on your ATCs for swaps, knitting, painting or on anything else you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a kid-friendly Open Studio (for those of you who would otherwise be unable to attend) but I have to stress that you will be responsible for keeping your child(ren) occupied at the studio. I will have some coloring pages on hand, and in the future I may have a more thought out craft available (for a small fee) if it seems that there is a need for that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of snow or icy conditions I may need to cancel so check your email before you leave for Holliston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY/TIME:&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday, January 19th, from 10:30am to 2:30pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGENDA:&lt;/strong&gt; No scheduled activities. Work on your own projects at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that you keep your RSVP up to date so we know who's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.) and some supplies including acrylic paints, old magazines and books for collaging. Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $10 to help defray the Studio rental costs. (ArtStudio 360 renters attend free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND&lt;/strong&gt;: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (kids welcome to attend with their parents - bring activities for them. I will have some coloring pages available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Space is limited, so please RSVP for your guests as well&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; Your own materials and projects to work on (just as you do for the regular Meetup). But basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use. Even if you show up empty-handed, we can get you started on projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Use front door (facing street) to enter building; come up 1 flight of stairs and we are first door on your right.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tamara</member_name><member_id>7371171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327120249000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326077356000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Studio (kids welcome), Thursday, 01/19, beginning at 10:30am in Holliston</name><id>47271062</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326987000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/47271062/</event_url></item>
