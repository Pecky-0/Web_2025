(And a great time!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean is a childhood friend of mine who has taken his talents from Cape Cod to &lt;a href="http://seanboycestudios.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=10465&amp;amp;Akey=R8JLSW3J" target="_blank"&gt;his studio on Newbury Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a diversion from Baseball? Join us for some complimentary wine, hors d'oeuvre, wine, Sean's amazing art and a glass or two of wine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean is a very personable artist who will walk us through the inspiration for some of his finest works, including Boston and Fenway pieces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we close down the reception, we will wander across the street to pick up the conversation over a glass of wine at a local bar/restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cost, just come out to support a talented artist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good times...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon</member_name><member_id>6918204</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284754793000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284002318000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>(Baseball diversion)...
