It has created a very volitile arena, and volitility is necessary for profit of any size. We will discuss a few potential trades selected by last month's attendees, and finish witih an open forum this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and to the right (the Peace Dale Room). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy working the laptop &amp; projector set up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226526400000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221737287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum October Meetup</name><id>8782159</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224108000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/8782159/</event_url></item>
