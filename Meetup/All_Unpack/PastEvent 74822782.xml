Yes, it's true! This will be more of a "free flowing" event since I assume it's going to be lots o' rollin' around the joint! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FROM THE NORTH STAR INVITE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oh Snap!!!! You ever want to dress to impress 80's or 90's themed and than strap on some Roller Skates, drink some Ketel One, and take a vitaminwater home with you... all in one night at one bar? That's right Roller Skating is Baaaack at The North Star and its gonna be full of surprises!!! We will have prizes for best dressed...Roller Limbo...and a little Dance Off for those that like to cut it up. Live DJ Battle between Dj EvaRedy &amp;amp; Dj Frank White with a special performance from Boston's B-Boys. I'd list more exciting activities that will be part of this night but if you have made it this far and aren't already sharing this event you must have just won the lotto or something because Next Thursday is going to be BANANAS! ~300 pairs of FREE rental sk8's at the bar means bring socks!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
