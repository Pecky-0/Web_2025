Drown in a sea of peak autumn foliage! Ponder civil disobedience and other existential things on the way to the 3,165 foot summit of Mount Monadnock, an isolated mountain in southern New Hampshire, about a 2 and a half hour drive from Providence, RI. Monadnock sports a large number of trails of various lengths and difficulties, so depending on the number of responses, we can break up into groups for different ascents. More information including a rendezvous plan will be forthcoming once I get a feel for the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested should expect a full day of hiking, and therefore plan to launch from their selected trailhead at 10:00 AM sharp so as not to end up on the mountain at dusk. As a heads up, it can get cold, windy, and wet toward the top, so you'll want to bring layers and something to shed water. Hiking boots are highly recommended. Also pack plenty of drinking water, high energy snacks, and a flashlight just in case. Luckily, the mountain is not home to venomous snakes or poison ivy, but a first aid kit is suggested anyhow. The following website has all the info about the mountain: &lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/explore/state-parks/monadnock-state-park.aspx" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.nhstateparks.org/explore/state-parks/monadnock-state-park.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jimmy Pelton</member_name><member_id>41798322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350305720000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347388700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Day hike at Mount Monadnock!!</name><id>81917352</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350223200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/81917352/</event_url></item>
