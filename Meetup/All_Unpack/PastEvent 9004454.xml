Dave and Jim stand a fantastic chance at being elected to the Statehouse.  To have Jim and Dave as sitting Reps would be a great benefit to the liberty movement in NH which continues to grow daily.&lt;br /&gt;Many of you have given money, time and effort and trust me, that hasn't gone unnoticed or unappreciated. However, I must shamelessly ask for still more time and effort. We're going to be lit dropping on Saturday in the towns of Milton, Middleton and New Durham. We'll meet at Suzanne's house at 9:30 am, supply and partner up and lit drop for a couple of hours and meet back at Suzanne's for some lunch. Looks like a strong possibility of homemade bread and soups for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;Weather looks nice for Saturday but don't forget your sweater!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225114931000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224617141000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lit Drop For Mincin And Forsythe!!</name><id>9004454</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224941400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9004454/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
