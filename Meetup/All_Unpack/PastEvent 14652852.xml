So grab your favorite board games, a deck of cards, and all of your friends for an early night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a joint meetup with some of most popular Meetup groups in Boston. Also, MeetIn Boston and the Yelp community will also be participating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some pictures from past Game Nites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any card and board games are welcome. What to bring? Well, Apples to Apples and Catch Phrase are always a hit at MGN. Up for some strategy games? You'll see Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, and other board games being played. Those of you who love cards, but don't quite remember how to play, don't despair! Members of Boston Cards and Conversation are always willing to teach old and new card games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mafia has been a hit at the past events and will surely be played again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't stay at home and watch TV, come out and have some FUN with us. And if you're going out on Friday night, the event is early enough that you can come socialize, play a few games, and then hit the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come for dinner, ice cream, or just games and socializing! Since this is an open event, come early, come late, stay for a bit, stay for the whole event, anything goes! Games last until 9:30pm or so, and many people go out for drinks and food at Legal Sea Food and Cheesecake Factory after the event...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the rear of Food Court next to Pizzeria Regina. Look for the Meetup sign. Are you game???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO GET THERE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By car: Here are some driving directions to the event. Street parking on Bolyston Street and the surrounding streets are available, but it is very limited, especially on a Friday night. Your best best will be to park at the Prudential Center garage, $12 with validation at any store or food vendor. For more information about parking at Prudential Center, visit their parking rates page. A map showing the parking garage entrances is here. The cheapest and most convenient way to get here is to carpool with a couple of friends -- when you split the cost of parking, it can be cheaper than the parking and taking the subway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By subway: If you are coming in via the subway, you have a number of great options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Green Line: For 'E' trains only, please use Prudential Station on Huntington Avenue. For all other Green Line trains, please use Copley on Boylston Street at Dartmouth Street (next to the Boston Public Library) or Hynes Convention Center on Massachusetts Avenue at Newbury Street.&lt;br /&gt;    * Orange Line or Commuter Rail: There's a direct underground connection between Copley Mall and Back Bay Station on the Orange and Purple Lines. From Copley Center you can cross the Copley Bridge into Prudential Center. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>8840173</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285072373000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>109</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283571628000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MeetUp Game Night 7</name><id>14652852</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284762600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/14652852/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
