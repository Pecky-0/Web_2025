Thanks, Olga for helping to organize a smooth night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inconvenience with the last meeting was that it was too warm in parts of the building.  On the bright side, we have an adventurous group that enjoys the experience of enjoying new establishments to meet up at month-after-month.   A curve ball or two is to be expected from time-to-time.  )))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the next meeting will be at a new establishment.  I regretfully will not be there, but will be looking forward to May's meeting and meeting some of the new faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dale&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Olga</member_name><member_id>5300063</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271978101000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Russian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordrussianmeetup</urlname><id>723352</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Russian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268931849000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casual Meetup - Hartford Russian Language Group</name><id>12923909</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271804400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordrussianmeetup/events/12923909/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/4/2/global_13051858.jpeg</photo_url></item>
