<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>~ Gnosticism in Theory and Practice ~&lt;br /&gt;This month we will discuss Gnosticism in it's many historic forms, talk about how those ancient traditions inform our modern traditions, and what it all means for us today. We'll discuss some modern Gnostic practices and how themes from old books written by dead guys still have relevance for us today. If you're new to Gnosticism or even if you're old hat, if you don't walk away with something new I'll totally give you your money back (which is a joke because there is no charge).&lt;br /&gt;This will be a little more of a free-form discussion than we've had in the past, so bring your questions and observations and this should be a pretty exciting and informative meeting!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
