In the meantime, I'm changing the movie to The Reader.  This movie was recently nominated for a Best Picture academy award.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reader:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he falls ill on his way home from school, 15 year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. The two begin an unexpected and passionate affair only for Hanna to suddenly and inexplicably disappear. Eight years later, Michael , now a young law student observing Nazi war trials, meets his former lover again, under very different circumstances. Hanna is on trial for a hideous crime, and as she refuses to defend herself, Michael gradually realizes his boyhood love may be guarding a secret she considers to be more shameful than murder. &lt;br /&gt;Cast: Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, Bruno Ganz, Matthias Habich &lt;br /&gt;Director: Stephen Daldry&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby.
