Merging a favorite writer (Dave Eggers) and a gifted directors' (Spike Jonze) creative talents to develop a story and world from a beloved children's book, this movie promises to be an exploration into the imagination. And an extra caveat or two for the indie music lover's soul for sure is the utilization of Arcade Fire to create one of the most impressive trailers ever and Karen O (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) at the helm of the soundtrack for the actual movie.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in honor of the relationship between indie music and this movie I am creating a meetup to go see Where the Wild Things Are. There is a showing this Sunday at 3:20 at AMC Loews Boston Common 19. Tickets are available on fandango or can be bought at the theater. We will meet a little before (2:45) to meet and greet and ensure all popcorn is secured in time. Following the meetup we can discuss somewhere to maybe eat, enjoy some warm cider or such, and basically just gab about the movie. Hope to see you there! I will email contact information to all maybe and yes RSVPs by Saturday. Take care! &lt;br /&gt;Jenn&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will provide my cell phone number to all maybe and yes RSVPs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenn</member_name><member_id>10142965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256246690000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255551151000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Where the Wild Things Are </name><id>11627566</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255891500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/11627566/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/7/global_11227735.jpeg</photo_url></item>
