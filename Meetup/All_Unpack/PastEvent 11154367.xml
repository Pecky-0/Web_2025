<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;This is my final event and I know it will be a memorable one!  We are doing the best of Boston with a stop at Minibar, one of Boston's best new lounges, and then heading off to dance the night away at The Estate!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Come to lounge out at Minibar at 8pm, or join us later at the Estate around 10pm....  or be a champ and join us for both!!  This is a great event to meet new people and to get your groove on!  All members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8pm at Minibar (51 Huntington Ave, inside the Copley Square Hotel) and head over to The Estate around 10pm to beat the lines (1 Boylston Place in The Alley).  These venues do get busy as the night rolls on, so if you don't find the group, please give me a ring (646.541.0708).  Please meet us at Minibar if you can, and get there early as to have time to meet folks.  Cover:  None for Minibar, but there will be a cover for the Estate, which is around $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dress appropriately as these are upscale venues.  If traveling by T, Copley Square, Prudential and Back Bay Stations are the closest for Minibar.  For the Estate, Boylston is the closest T stop on the green line.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!
