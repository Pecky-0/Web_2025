I had to fly home to take care of my mother, who suddenly had become ill. No worries though, she is doing much better now and I am happy to be back in the States and getting together with you again on the 22nd. If only you have time :-). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comon down to RiRa's to catch up, to have a few beers and maybe some delicious dinner. I would love to see many of the old faces and certainly would love to welcome some of the many new members who have joined our group lately. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hope to see you in a couple of weeks! Take care and enjoy the spring and the beautiful weather until then. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the German flag!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272150302000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270779361000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April's Stammtisch!!</name><id>13131133</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271977200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/13131133/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
