<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Number of people: 6 (comfortably) to 8 (kind of packed)&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet up for a night of charity knitting for the troops. I have recently started putting together care packages for soldiers serving overseas who may not get much mail (see &lt;a href="http://www.anysoldier.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.anysoldier.com &lt;/a&gt;to see how the program works). Washcloths and other handmade goodies are on many of the wishlists...and knitters are good at washcloths and handmade goodies! We'll spend the evening knitting washcloths (or anything else you might want to contribute) and eating good food.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here's what I'll take care of...I'll make a vegetarian lasagna for dinner and will also have drinks on hand. My stash is overflowing with cotton, so don't feel like you have to bust into yours. Just come on over and pick a skein...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here's what you can bring...a pair of knitting needles (I think I usually use a size 6 for washcloths) and, if you want one, a favorite washcloth pattern. You're welcome to bring something potlucky to share...but it is absolutely not necessary! If you do want to bring something, just post it in your RSVP so that we don't double up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to keep in mind...if you can't make it but want to contribute, I will absolutely take donations for the care packages. If you come and can't finish a project that night, don't worry about it. I'll post the package toward the end of the month, so everyone will have plenty of time to finish things up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also...I have three cats that have free reign of the house. If you are allergic, I promise that you will have allergy problems here! Feel free to park in the driveway or on the grass along the side of the driveway...as long as you don't block anyone in (especially my neighbors). My apartment is the one with the porch.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253575123000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250033336000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charity Knit Night</name><id>11089915</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253309400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/11089915/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/b/global_10155035.jpeg</photo_url></item>
