A hub of transportation and recreation, the lower basin has experienced several cycles of dramatic change resulting from the construction of bridges and dams, the expansion of Boston, and the Big Dig project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This most awesome unique walking tour explores the evolution of the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Charles_River_Basin" target="_blank"&gt;Charles River Basin&lt;/a&gt; and the engineering of a city. If you like the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Boston_Underfoot" target="_blank"&gt;Boston Underfoot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Boats_Bridges_Locks" target="_blank"&gt;Boats, Bridges &amp;amp; Locks tours&lt;/a&gt; and are looking for more, this tour won't disappoint. Looking at the artifacts we'll see how the Charles River was changed from a tidal estuary to the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; we know today through a concerted effort to reshape Boston through land-making and the construction of a dam (and 10,000 wooden pilings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also see the impact of the many railway lines of the 19th century as well as the construction of the Northern &amp;amp; Southeast Expressways in the 20th century had on the lower basin. We'll see many types of bridges along the way including some vestiges of bridges long gone. Walking among the new, and in some areas incomplete projects, we'll examine the progress on the revitalization of the area including the development at North Point and the 3 new parks that provide a graceful transition from their Olmstedian predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't been through this area, we guarantee you some spectacular and unique views on Boston. We will see all the nooks and crannies people drive past, but never get out and explore. This tour is NOT a little stroll. For two hours we will WALK! Over bridges, under bridges, underneath expressways, over railroads, along prisons, over dirt &amp;amp; gravel, through grassy fields, and on top of movable locks. And it would be a Boston By Foot tour if we didn't find an excuse to toss in a touch of &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Beacon_Hill" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Bulfinch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Dark_Side" target="_blank"&gt;catastrophic fire&lt;/a&gt; along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are an explorer at heart, a fan of landscape architecture, a history buff, or an engineering &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/"&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt;, there's something on this tour for everyone. Dress very comfortably and bring along some water. They may call it the &amp;quot;lost half-mile,&amp;quot; but it's two miles around. Meet us behind the Science Park/West End Green Line Station in Nashua Street Park (across from the Suffolk County Jail) before the start of the tour. Tickets are $15 per person ($5 for Boston By Foot card holders).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Boston By Foot badges, bags, hats, etc.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Coppeto</member_name><member_id>7594176</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249757926000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246193741000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exploring The Charles River Basin: The Lost Half-Mile</name><id>10751830</id><headcount>65</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248631200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/10751830/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/a/2/global_9380466.jpeg</photo_url></item>
