This is a very good film that helps us understand from a scientific viewpoint how we all manage to link with spirit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have people come who are not members of Meetup, so please do not think that because it does not look like anyone else is coming that you will be the only one!  Please come ready for good food, good conversation, and a great time with like minded folks!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light of spirit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259878090000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255866306000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>What the Bleep!</name><id>kzlnympbcc</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258844400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/11652546/</event_url></item>
