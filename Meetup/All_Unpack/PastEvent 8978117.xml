This is a youth program dedicated to promoting human development through the use of an innovative performance-based model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the All Stars is that it meets young people where they are, on the streets, and invites them to do what they love to do, &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;span style="color: violet"&gt;perform&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; And then together, we create the opportunity for learning and growth. I love being able to be a part of the lives of young people from poor neighborhoods. Especially, when being a part means being a partner in their development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you'll join me in supporting the Boston All Stars by coming out to an evening of FUN with performances put on by our youth!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of Tri-Chair's of this fundraiser for the Boston All Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boston All Stars Perform!: On the streets where we live&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's a benefit with a silent auction.
