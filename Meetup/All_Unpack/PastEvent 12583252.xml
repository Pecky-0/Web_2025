Screenplay by Julian Fellowes. Director of photography: Hagen Bogdanski. Cast: Emily Blunt, Rupert Friend, Miranda Richardson, Jim Broadbent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever comes into your mind when you think of the Victorian Age, from workhouses to prudery to Empire, has little to do with the sheltered-but-feisty 18-year-old girl who became Queen of England, ready or not, in 1837. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wore Prada) is completely appealing as an isolated princess whose only companions in a cold and drafty palace are scheming politicians and a faithful spaniel, until the moment she meets Alfred, her scandalously handsome Saxon cousin. “A transcendent Emily Blunt stars in a rich pastiche of first love, teen empowerment, fabulous fashion and fate!” - Betsey Sharkey, L.
