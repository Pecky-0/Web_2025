<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Based, in part, on the responses to the poll about event locations, I have decided to host a holiday themed event in my home.&amp;nbsp; Part book club, and part social gathering, I want this to be an occasion for members to get to know each other, as well as discuss a book; which for this event will be: &lt;strong&gt;Holidays on Ice&lt;/strong&gt;, by David Sedaris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/7/6/event_71946262.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holidays on Ice is a collection of three previously published stories matched with three newer ones, all, of course, on a Christmas theme. David Sedaris's darkly playful humor is another common thread through the book, worming its way through "Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!" a chipper suburban Christmas letter that spirals dizzily out of control, and "Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol," a vicious theatrical review of children's Christmas pageants. As always, Sedaris's best work is his sharply observed nonfiction, notably in "Dinah, the Christmas Whore," the tale of a memorable Christmas during which the young Sedaris learns to see his family in a new light. Worth the price of the book alone is the hilarious "SantaLand Diaries," Sedaris's chronicle of his time working as an elf at Macy's, covering everything from the preliminary group lectures ("You are not a dancer. If you were a real dancer you wouldn't be here. You're an elf and you're going to wear panties like an elf.") to the perils of inter-elf flirtation. Along the way, he paints a funny and sad portrait of the way the countless parents who pass through SantaLand are too busy creating an Experience to really pay attention to their children. In a sly way, it carries a holiday message all its own. Read it aloud to the adults after the kids have gone to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have wine, cocktails and snacks on hand, but contributions of food and drink are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home is in Needham, but the exact address will be sent via email to all yes RSVPs the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a greyhound in residence (and possible also a cat, but that's another story), so if you are highly allergic or scared of large dogs, this may not be a good meetup event for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324670449000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>thatotherbookgroup</urlname><id>1149392</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>That Other Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321130275000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holidays on Ice</name><id>40931642</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324598400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/thatotherbookgroup/events/40931642/</event_url></item>
