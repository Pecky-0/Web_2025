Last time I went I went early and bought the tickets then had to wait in line to enter the trail. We could grab something to eat at mcdonalds if people would like to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link for the event if anyone wants to check this out before hand. I had an amazingly spooky time a few years ago, it was really well done and highly recommend going again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trailofterror.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trailofter...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will give out my cell phone number to those that are going</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310132585000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285119400000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trail of Terror in Wallingford</name><id>14852996</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287352800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/14852996/</event_url></item>
