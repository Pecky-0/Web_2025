Here's her pic, on the left of me, although she'll kill me ;) So, we'll be at the Derryfield in Manchester.&lt;br /&gt;Here is DJ S.O.B.'s website, if you want to check out their music. &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/djsob" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt; - you know me, I'll dance to anything.&lt;br /&gt;Karen's picking me up at 7:30, so I should be there by 8pm, but if anyone can get there early and try to round up some tables, or if you want to go earlier to eat feel free.  There's usually a cover around 8:30-9 of $5 I think?&lt;br /&gt;Get there by 8pm and I'll do the intros, up until the band starts, after that you're on your own, because I'll be on the dance floor.&lt;br /&gt;hope to boogie with you soon,&lt;br /&gt;susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs on table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291471604000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
