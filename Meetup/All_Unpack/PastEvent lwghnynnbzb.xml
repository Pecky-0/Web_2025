Those that come to dinner get to help pick the movie for the evening. The first to arrive will grab a table at Chili's (which is across the street from the Burlington Mall) around 6:30 PM. During dinner we will review what movies are playing and have a start time between 7:30 and 8:00 PM. Whatever the majority can agree on is what we'll see.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP Marie will respond with her cell phone number so if you're running late and can't make dinner, you can find out what movie we've decided to see and when it starts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don't come without RSVPing. Recently we ended up canceling dinner and eating in the theater instead because the movie we all wanted to see started too early to eat in the restaurant. I need to know who to contact if plans change.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Movie - $10.00 &lt;br /&gt;Dinner - $12.00 - $20.00 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Address for the Theater is:  &lt;br /&gt;AMC Theaters Burlington - Cinema 10  &lt;br /&gt;20 South Avenue &lt;br /&gt;Burlington, MA 01803 &lt;br /&gt;888-262-4386  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  &lt;br /&gt;Take Rt. 128/95 to the MIDDLESEX TPK/US-3 N exit, EXIT 32A-B, toward BURLINGTON/LOWELL. &lt;br /&gt;Take the MIDDLESEX TURNPIKE exit, EXIT 32B, toward BURLINGTON/ARLINGTON. &lt;br /&gt;Keep RIGHT at the fork to go on MIDDLESEX TURNPIKE. &lt;br /&gt;Chili's is in the strip mall next to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, directly across the street from the Burlington Mall.
