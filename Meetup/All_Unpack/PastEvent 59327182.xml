The structure of the meetup - two thirds of the time - sharing and discussion, and 1 third demonstration of experiential techniques for effortless healing using the newest techniques in quantum and energy psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have a discussion on narcissistic abusers and on consequences of those relationships. They appear charismatic and smooth-talking to their friends but are EXTREMELY abusive to their partners and cause DEEP, SEVERE abuse and trauma. They act like they are better than you and are always name-calling. They destroy your self-esteem and treat you like garbage. A talk on this would be helpful to build up our self-worth again. We invite all abuse survivors to participate in this discussion. Many professionals feel that all abusers are narcissistic. But... there is that special group of males and females who are "certifiable" narcissists. Either way, they cause pain with no regard to how their words and actions impact others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what participants say about our discussion group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"These meetups are always top notch. The coordinators are extremely knowledgeable,&lt;img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/clear.gif" width="0" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/em&gt; supportive and intuitive and I always come away with some great new ideas and perspectives. Regular attendees are also extremely warm and helpful. I'm giving only four stars because there's always room for improvement, but honestly I can't think what that would be at the moment ;) This group really is very put together and helpful. Recommend to any and all looking for fresh ideas and understanding people."&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a yellow road sign "Children" right next to the steps to the house.
