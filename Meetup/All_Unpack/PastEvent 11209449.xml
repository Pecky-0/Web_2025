We'll meet at 8AM at the ferry at Point Judith. The first ferry is at 9AM but it may be busy over the labor day weekend so we want to get there early. Bring your bikes, swim suits, and whatever else you want for a day at Block Island. We'll plan on biking around the island, then doing some swimming and hitting the bar for beers.  The ferry costs 18.25 plus 6.00 for a bike for round trip. Ferries run from the Island back to Point Judith up until 7PM so we can stay up until then and of course people are welcome to join us for only part of the day. Lets hope for good weather! Also, if you dont have a bike but want to come there are plenty of bike rental places on the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***You can buy your tickets ahead of time for the ferry at &lt;a href="http://ticketing.blockislandferry.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://ticketing.bloc...&lt;/a&gt;  ****&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>call my cell 508-414-8544 or just look for the group at the ferry</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252417445000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251322225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike and Beers on Block Island</name><id>11209449</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252152000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11209449/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/f/3/global_10426339.jpeg</photo_url></item>
