In particular, the EntreTech Forum?s panelists will help the audience understand the funding value-chain from the perspective of the funding sources themselves.  Panelists have been brought together from seed-level government grants and angel funding through venture capital sources all the way to mature investment banking and commercial banking applications.  This forum event will break new ground in bringing together representatives of each funding source all at once.  For all of those individuals interested in understanding the inputs, outputs, incentives, and issues from the standpoint of venture funding sources, this is a must-attend event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moderator&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mr. Andrew Fairbairn&lt;/u&gt;, Managing Principal, Fairbairn Ventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Managing Principal of Fairbairn Ventures, Andrew partners with driven entrepreneurs to rapidly prove out value propositions and to build solid growth companies around that value.
