&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got To Get The Chaos Out Of Your Life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Cowgill is currently an author, a national speaker, private lending consultant, and expert on real estate business management. He's been featured in three newspaper articles about purchasing real estate through private lenders. He's appeared in three National Infomercials and he's been published in two books titled "Walking with the Wise" where Donald Trump and other well known figures also contributed to these books. He spent 5 years early in his real estate career mastering the art of streamlining and automating his business and has it down to a science. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Turn your real estate business into a hands-free money machine that runs without you! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;If you're tired of being glued to your phone, trapped in your car, chained to your computer, or buried alive by endless bills and papers, Alan will show you how he developed systems that have saved him thousands of dollars. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Alan will show you things like: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;* How he wiped the chaos out of his business &lt;br /&gt;

* How he created foolproof check sheets and systems that can't be messed up &lt;br /&gt;

* The 3 forms he has all employees sign &lt;br /&gt;

* How he found and hired the right assistant &lt;br /&gt;

* How he created his office filing system &lt;br /&gt;

* How he put these tasks on "auto-pilot": negotiations, property acquisitions, flips, sales, lease options, contractor meetings, property management and long-term rentals &lt;br /&gt;

* How he manages tenants, contractors, private lenders, and collections &lt;br /&gt;

* How he handles all the steps and forms involved in selling a house &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;He will show his comprehensive systems that cover: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;* Everyday Administration &lt;br /&gt;

* Meeting and Office Reports &lt;br /&gt;

* Payables and Receivables &lt;br /&gt;

* Property Purchase &lt;br /&gt;

* Selling Property &lt;br /&gt;

* Collections&lt;/p&gt;
