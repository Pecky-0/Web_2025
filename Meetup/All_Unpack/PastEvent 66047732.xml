WHOO HOO!! And while many people are going out of town, there's MUCH fun to be had right here in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honors are my FAVORITE band in Boston. Come on down on Sunday night for some lovely libations and some awesome music.  The Honors are a rock cover band and always put their all into their shows.  "Lugsy" will be slinging drinks behind the bar all night.  Fun times with great music, great food/beer, and great company! No COVER.  The Honors take the stage at 9:30pm.  I should be there by 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Dragon is conveniently located in the Haymarket (Green and Orange Lines), near Government Center (Green and Blue Lines) and a short walk to Park Street (Red Line).  There is (very) limited street parking (meters are free on Sunday), and there are also several area parking garages.  Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE PAY AS YOU GO OR MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SEPARATE TAB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture, or just ask the bartender who I am.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338259516000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337804182000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LIVE MUSIC with The Honors</name><id>66047732</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338166800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/66047732/</event_url></item>
