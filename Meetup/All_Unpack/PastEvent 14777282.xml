<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Great River Ride in Westfield, MA has been recognized by 'Bicycling' Magazine as one of the top 10 in the country for scenic beauty, great support, and challenge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information including registration is &lt;a href="http://newhorizonsbikes.com/articles/great-river-ride-2010-pg161.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The route map as described from the cue sheet is &lt;a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-states/ma/westfield/926128447538165207" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And &lt;a href="http://beta.mapmyride.com/routes/detail/22989472/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the elevation profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the last century in MA this year it promises to be a great test of all the training we've put into ourselves over the season.  They actually &lt;i&gt;recommend&lt;/i&gt; triple cranks if you can believe that.  Riders also have the option of having their ride timed as an official RUSA populaire.  If anyone is interested in riding longer distances or perhaps breaking into a full brevet series next season, I think this should be a great introduction to that arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offered ride lengths are 10, 20, 35, 62 (Metric century), 85 or the full 110 miles.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan</member_name><member_id>11982073</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286797465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284551048000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Great River Ride - Westfield MA</name><id>14777282</id><headcount>300</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286708400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/14777282/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/7/global_17076615.jpeg</photo_url></item>
