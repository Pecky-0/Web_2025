(Thanks to Odette, it was her great idea.)  However, due to some unexpected circumstances, we have to change the location of the party.  The party will not be held Boston, but will be in Acton, MA which is about five miles west of Concord at the intersection of Rt 2 and I-495.  I will send out an e-mail with the detail of the location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a cook-out between 4:00-8:00 pm.  Bring a main dish, snack, side dish, or desert, and whatever you want to drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic.)  Please let us know a little bit about what you are bringing so that we don't have too much of the same thing.  There will also be a small grill, if anyone wants to bring something to grill.  If anyone has an extra grill that they can bring that would be helpful too.  This is going to be mainly an outside event, (I'll bring insect repellent) so if the weather is bad and its raining a lot, we'll probably have to cancel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are also adding a $2.00 fee for each guest to cover the cost of the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the cook out has ended, we can decide what we want to do about watching the fireworks.  The fireworks in Boston will be televised along with the Boston Pops, and I will have the concert on TV for anyone that wants to watch it.  The Boston Pops concert is from 8:30 to 10:30, and the fireworks are scheduled to begin at 10:30 pm.  There is also a fireworks display in Acton that begins at 9:00 pm.  The cook out is ending early enough so that anyone that wants to go into Boston to watch the fireworks will have time to get there, or we can watch fireworks locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have any plans, come and join us.  It should be a good time.  See you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215374933000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213576873000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fourth of July Cook-out</name><id>8149227</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215201600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/8149227/</event_url></item>
