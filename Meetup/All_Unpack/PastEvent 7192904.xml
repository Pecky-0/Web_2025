<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will continue with Locke's Essay, Book 2. More exactly the first part of Book 2 from chapter 1 through (including) chapter 21 (Of Power). This with the notes to chapter 21 is a bit longer than half of Book 2 and more than we usually choose to read, but this time is one of those times of the year when we have 3 weeks between meetings. (We meet the second and forth Thursdays of each month.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rendang is still closed so we will continue to meet at the Bombay Club.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please ask about us (philosophy group) from the staff.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203120595000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201267979000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Locke: An Essay Concerning Human Understanding II</name><id>7192904</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202947200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/7192904/</event_url></item>
