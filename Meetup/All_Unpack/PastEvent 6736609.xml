Sung Kim will speak to us about Cold Laser Therapy for Fibromyalgia Pain.  Don't miss this meeting.  Cold Laser has been found to be very beneficial for Fibromyalgia Pain as reported in the Fibromyalgia Network Newsletter earlier this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the November meeting Betsy gave a talk about Detoxification and Supplementation as it relates directly to Fibromyalgia sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been requesting members bring information about the healthcare providers that have helped them with this illness.  So far the list is too small to publish. Bring a list with the practitioner's name and phone number and any relevant information you have about them so we can add them to a master list in the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542600000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195002606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia December Meetup</name><id>6736609</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197417600000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/6736609/</event_url></item>
