 The wait is finally over! It's time for another Mega Game Nite! This is the event that everyone will be talking about. Join us for our eleventh Mega Game Nite in Boston on February 1st. MGN continues to be a great way to mix and mingle with old friends and meet new people! So grab your favorite board or cards game for an early night on the town. &lt;br /&gt;

 Like our event last year, MGN XI will actually be divided up into different sections, specializing in certain themes: &lt;br /&gt;

 ◦The Party Palace will have the main playing area for party games and for those who just want to socialize with other attendees. &lt;br /&gt;

 ◦The Card Room will be for those who rather play card games (Poker, Spades, Hearts, Bridge, Cribbage, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;

 ◦The Strategy Bunker is a separate area for those who want to play more serious strategy games (such as Settlers of Catan, Risk, Blokus, Ticket to Ride, etc.) We have a lot of people interested in these types of games, so we wanted to provide a special location for those to congregate. &lt;br /&gt;

 ◦??? (it's a secret) &lt;br /&gt;

 Never been to a MGN? Here's some pictures from previous Game Nites to give you a feel what to expect: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

What to bring? Well, any card and board games are welcome. Apples to Apples and Catch Phrase are always popular. Up for some strategy games? You'll see Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, and other board games being played. Unsure? We'll have a set of volunteers who will be supervising to assist you in finding a great crowd of people to play with. &lt;br /&gt;

 So come for dinner and some drinks, or just games and socializing! Since this is an open event, come early, come late, stay for a bit, stay for the whole event, anything goes! The event is held until 10pm. Afterwards, many attendees go out for drinks and food at Legal Sea Food and Cheesecake Factory after the event... &lt;br /&gt;

 The event is held in the rear of Food Court next to Pizzeria Regina. Look for the Meetup Game Nite sign. Are you game??? &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW TO GET THERE &lt;br /&gt;

 By car: Here are some driving directions to the event. Street parking on Boylston Street and the surrounding streets are available, but it is very limited, especially on a Friday night. Your best bet will be to park at the Prudential Center garage, $12 with validation at any store or food vendor. For more information about parking at Prudential Center, visit their parking rates page. A map showing the parking garage entrances is here. The cheapest and most convenient way to get here is to carpool with a couple of friends -- when you split the cost of parking, it can be cheaper than the parking and taking the subway... &lt;br /&gt;

 By subway: If you are coming in via the subway, you have a number of great options: &lt;br /&gt;

 ◦Green Line: For 'E' trains only, please use Prudential Station on Huntington Avenue. For all other Green Line trains, please use Copley on Boylston Street at Dartmouth Street (next to the Boston Public Library) or Hynes Convention Center on Massachusetts Avenue at Newbury Street. &lt;br /&gt;

 ◦Orange Line or Commuter Rail: There's a direct underground connection between Copley Mall and Back Bay Station on the Orange and Purple Lines. From Copley Center you can cross the Copley Bridge into Prudential Center. &lt;br /&gt;
