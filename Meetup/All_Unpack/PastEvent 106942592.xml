<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's get a group of us together to keep one another on track. We'll set goals and discuss how we can reach them on an individual basis. We can check in with each other each week and talk about our progress (and regression). I'll post some kind of checklist for healthy eating and exercise and everyone can comment on how it's going for them and give tips. This isn't necessarily to lose weight but more to get healthier and feel more fit. I'm not sure how to do this on the website but when I hear back from people interested I'll figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a date to go out and meet it's a beginning date for everyone's "get healthier lifestyle" so I was thinking of posting some things for people to check out or maybe do it via email when we get enough people in the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Not an actual meetup - just a group of us checking in with each other and maybe meeting at some points.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tobie</member_name><member_id>10498367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362454455000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362090156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get Healthy for Spring</name><id>106942592</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362416400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/106942592/</event_url></item>
