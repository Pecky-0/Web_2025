Tom will be joining us from his home in Belfast to guide us through a local Portland park (exact location TBD) in search of the ubiquitous edibles and medicinals.  We are likely to find more of the latter this time of year, so we are already planning another forage in late May 2009 to find more edibles in season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom is a Registered Maine Guide, Author, Journalist, and not least of all a Scottish Bagpiper!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:15 or 1:30 potluck picnic lunch (and maybe a musical serenade from Tom!) &lt;br /&gt;2:30 introductory discussion. &lt;br /&gt;2:45 or so begin the forage/walk&lt;br /&gt;Wrap up around 4:30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:  In order for this to be a meaningful event for attendees, we have to limit the group size and it is likely to fill up quickly.  If you would like to attend but there is no space, RSVP &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; with a comment that you want to be on the waiting list.  We may be able to run another one in September.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to bring: &lt;br /&gt;Sturdy walking clothes/shoes, raingear if applicable, sunscreen &amp;amp; bug repellent, a notebook and digital camera, a field guide if desired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the lunch: &lt;br /&gt;Bring a dish to share (in a cooler would be best) with serving spoon, a picnic blanket or folding chair, your potluck kit (dish/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend ordering a copy of Tom's book from your local independent bookseller: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foraging-New-England-Identifying-Connecticut/dp/0762709545/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1217524378&amp;amp;sr=1-3" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220572741000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218131442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Forage with Author Tom Seymour (Afternoon Version)</name><id>8497775</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220207400000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/8497775/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/1/c/global_4990380.jpeg</photo_url></item>
