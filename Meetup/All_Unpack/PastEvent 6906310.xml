Lobbying to pass animal welfare related bills, and to oppose animal unfriendly bills is a great way to do just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people think that lobbying is scary or hard to do....not so!  It can be easy, fun and very rewarding..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been thinking about getting involved for animals at this level, but don't know where to start, or if you just want to hone your skills, please join me for the Maine Humane Lobby Day on February 13th 2008!  We will be spending the day in Augusta, learning some tips and how-tos, then meeting with our legislators in the afternoon.  We'll have lunch together, network and make plans for the animals in Maine.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be a great, productive day and I hope you can all make it!   Please feel free to contact with with questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the animals,&lt;br /&gt;Katie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203087808000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197557316000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maine Humane Lobby Day- CANCELLED!!</name><id>6906310</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202914800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/6906310/</event_url></item>
