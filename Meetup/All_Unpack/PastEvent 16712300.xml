(Longer-time members are invited to attend, play and share what they know, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Start with some ATC basics, including tips for working in this particular format and for making cards that last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Make our own blank cards from various materials (watercolor paper, cardstock, chipboard, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Experiment with a variety of techniques for creating ATC backgrounds (usually the first step in making ATCs).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the workshop, you're welcome to stay at the Studio to play as long as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll go home with plenty of blank cards and backgrounds for future projects--and probably some finished cards as well. I'll also provide handouts covering what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some  tools (paper  cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave,  toaster oven,  kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people  are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST: &lt;/strong&gt;$15 to help defray the Studio rental costs. Includes all supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: &lt;/strong&gt;Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW  TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt; These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting  list.  Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function.  You may  RSVP for a guest as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests'  plans) change, PLEASE update your  RSVP accordingly. Please do this right  up to the start time of the  event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING: &lt;/strong&gt;Supplies will be provided (included in  your cost for attending). If you have favorite tools, you're welcome to bring them. But we have plenty of scissors, glue sticks, etc., available for your use. Even if you show up empty-handed, you'll be fine. I also suggest bringing water or something else to drink, and, if you like, a snack to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;In the  unlikely event that we need to cancel---or  even if we're just getting a  late start--we'll post a message on the  Web site and e-mail everyone  who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe  side, please check the Web site  and your inbox before departing for  ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;
