Since there isn't an RSVP limit OR deadline if unsure RSVP the day before the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make the hike join us at Finder's at about 12-12:30.&lt;br /&gt;Call Nancy if you're joining us late or for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;(508)612-5989&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Blue Pontiac Sunfire</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239041043000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237231606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike on The Mass Central Rail Trail</name><id>9967127</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238851800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/9967127/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/f/6/global_6017366.jpeg</photo_url></item>
