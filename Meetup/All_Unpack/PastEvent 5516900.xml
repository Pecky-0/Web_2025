This is an Austrian documentary about modern food production  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the world of industrial food production and high-tech farming! To the rhythm of conveyor belts and immense machines, the film looks without commenting into the places where food is produced in Europe: monumental spaces, surreal landscapes and bizarre sounds - a cool, industrial environment which leaves little space for individualism. People, animals, crops and machines play a supporting role in the logistic of this system which provides our society's standard of living. OUR DAILY BREAD is a wide-screen tableau of a feast which isn't always easy to digest - and in which we all take part. A pure, meticulous and high-end film experience that enables the audience to form their own ideas.&amp;quot;  from the IMDb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no narration, the impact of this film relies on the images alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary has been well received and here is one of the many favorable reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-wk-bread22feb22,0,6865416.story" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.calendarli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row. We may choose to go for a drink after this one and bypass the local restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173827081000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172538091000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Our Daily Bread"- A Feast for the Eyes at the HFA</name><id>5516900</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173654000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5516900/</event_url></item>
