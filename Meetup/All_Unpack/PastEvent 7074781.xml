It should be warm this week, though possibly rainy. No matter; the disc must go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Please, please wear a light-colored shirt! Playing under the stadium lights is awesome, but it makes it even harder to see people sometimes. Let's keep our games injury-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those taking public transportation, follow the map to walk to Russell Field via the path from Alewife T Station, OR take the 83 bus from either Porter or Central Square. If you are taking the T, be sure to go LEFT after you get off the train. That particular exit will say &amp;quot;Russell field&amp;quot; and should dump you on the path to Russell (A 5 min walk, tops!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those driving, park in the public parking lot alongside the playing field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/2062/russelfieldio5.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/2062/russelfieldio5.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://img246.imagesh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/3478/russelfieldpathqk8.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/3478/russelfieldpathqk8.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://img175.imagesh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll provide the glowsticks and frisbees. Feel free to email us with questions. Afterwards, we can try Bertucci's, or possibly get pizza at Jim O's house. See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be warming up on the football field behind the athletic center.
