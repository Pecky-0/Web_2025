It is showing in one of the upstairs theaters, so I will be in the area with all the tables, near the coffee concession stand.   I will try to snag a table, if not I will be nearby.....I will be wearing a badge, so any of the new members will be able to find me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martian Child&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Sophie Okonedo, Bobby Coleman, Joan Cusack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.martianchild.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.martianchi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: The romantic drama &amp;quot;Martian Child&amp;quot; stars John Cusack as a recently widowed science fiction writer who forms an unlikely family with a close friend (Amanda Peet) and a young boy he adopts that claims to be from Mars. The new couple ignores some sage parenting advice from the widower's sister (Joan Cusack) and gets more than they bargained for when a series of strange occurrences lead them to believe that the child's claim may be true. Based on an award-winning short story by sci-fi luminary David Gerrold, &amp;quot;Martian Child' is directed by Menno Meyjes and produced by David Kirschner, Corey Sienega and Ed Elbert. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add more details later when actual movie times become available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194305555000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191086421000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Martian Child</name><id>6451933</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194132600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/6451933/</event_url></item>
