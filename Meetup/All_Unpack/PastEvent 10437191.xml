We need to move the event to TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 2009.  Please update your RSVP's accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: Per Alex's request, the location has been changed to the Columbus Cafe... presumably to commemorate the spot of his very first meetup event.  Please update your RSVP's accordingly!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come July, our comrade Alex is bailing on Boston and moving to Texas to attend business school.  Join us at his favorite restaurant as we mark his send-off with vino, macaroni and lots of good cheer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leigh and Krisy </member_name><member_id>8616476</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245971289000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242660191000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arrivederci Alex! @ The Columbus Cafe, South End</name><id>10437191</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245798000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10437191/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/e/global_8690654.jpeg</photo_url></item>
