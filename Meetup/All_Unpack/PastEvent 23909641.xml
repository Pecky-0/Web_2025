They also allow other flotation devices, so even if you don't have a kayak, you can bring your tubes, floats or floating lounge chairs and linger on the lake! All are welcome to come back to my home in Ashford afterwards for a BBQ, some badminton or volleyball, and assorted board games. Admission to the park is $9 per car, so we could meet at my place first and car pool as much as possible. More details (my address, etc) will follow later...&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310935081000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Windham-Area-Games-Group</urlname><id>1514926</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>Windham Area Games Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309312563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayaking or swimming followed by BBQ and games</name><id>23909641</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310832000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Windham-Area-Games-Group/events/23909641/</event_url></item>
