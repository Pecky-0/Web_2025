It is supposed to be a sunny day, around 40 degrees, so this would be an excellent opportunity to get out and enjoy a great walk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have a GPS parking is at 140 Elm St Halifax, MA. There's a sign for Burrage Pond at the end of the road. It's just past a bike shop that has a white bike with Christmas lights out front. Here's a google map link to the parking lot: &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/2d6pmn6" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/2d...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to cancel if you are not going to make it. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>  If you have a GPS parking is at 140 Elm St Halifax, MA.
