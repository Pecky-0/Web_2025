The term comes from the French word glace, which used in reference to a sauce means icing or glaze. It is traditionally made by combining equal parts of veal stock and sauce espagnole, the latter being one of the four mother sauces of classical French cuisine, and the mixture is then simmered and reduced by half. Common variants of demi-glace use a 1:1 mixture of beef or chicken stock to sauce espagnole; these are referred to as &amp;quot;beef demi-glace&amp;quot; (demi-glace au boeuf) or &amp;quot;chicken demi-glace&amp;quot; (demi-glace au poulet). The term &amp;quot;demi-glace&amp;quot; by itself implies that it is made with the traditional veal stock.&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/shock.gif' border='0' alt='shock' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is that we are going to learn how to make demi-glace by gathering for the day at my place and getting down to simmering. There is a lot of simmering in the process of making demi-glace. Even if you have made demi-glace before join in the fun of just cooking and being with foodies! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the pot of sauce is done we'll divide it amongst the attendees and  take it to our various homes to astound and amaze our friends and families! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we are watching the pot simmer we are going to watch food movies, play food games, cook and eat other non-simmering non glacey things and enjoy each others company. If it is a good weather day we'll use the back yard, maybe do a bar-b-que. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gady will be our gentle guide in the process of the demi-glace. &lt;b&gt;There is a cost to this event!!&lt;/b&gt; He will purchase all the demi-glace ingredients and attendees will chip in to cover his costs. The amount will depend on how many people participate and how much things cost at the store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring drink, pot luck dish, food games, food DVDs, recipes for using a demi-glace a plastic container with good sealing top to hold your portion of the finished product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be both fun and educational! If you can't stay all day but you are a regular attendee of the cooking club feel free to just drop by! Please only RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; if you can spend a few hours of the afternoon and maybe early evening with us. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gady</member_name><member_id>8983958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271689514000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270075211000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Demi Moore Demi Lovato Demi Glace</name><id>13052515</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271516400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/13052515/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/4/global_14053140.jpeg</photo_url></item>
