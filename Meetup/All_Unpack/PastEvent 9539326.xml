A drumset fits up the stairs, an acoustic upright bass fits up the stairs, you all can fit too!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd be willing to host a regular jam every other week.  I'd also be open to other nights of the week to get more interest and people to come.  For instance, Thursdays one week and two weeks later on a Sunday.  Or we could alternate and try Cantab in Central Sq Cambridge on Wed or Sun night 9pm-midnight to see how their jams are -- I haven't been in a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please send me your feedback/ideas on tunes and what nights are preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your charts, ideas, beer if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.  Everyone's welcome, even just for listening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg&lt;br /&gt;Home # 781-316-8032&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring doorbell or come on in if you hear music.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>7685457</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233800240000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans/Musicians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>jazz-190</urlname><id>1202977</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Cambridge/Somerville/Boston Jazz Meetup/Jam</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232140117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Jazz Jam night</name><id>9539326</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232926200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/jazz-190/events/9539326/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/b/global_6953227.jpeg</photo_url></item>
