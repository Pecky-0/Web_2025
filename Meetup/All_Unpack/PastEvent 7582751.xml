Hope everyone had a great Easter &amp;amp; are getting ready for the spring (yeah!).  Our April meetup will be held outside (providing good weather), which I know the pups will love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are also hosting the National Pet Adoptathon on Saturday, May 3.  We have several local rescue groups coming with many asoptable cats &amp;amp; dogs.  The adoptathon will be held from 11am-3pm at the Best Friends location.  Please let all of your friends know too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held at Best Friends Pet Care off of Rt-97 less than a mile from I-95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208797657000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206209565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs April Meeting</name><id>7582751</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208624400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/7582751/</event_url></item>
