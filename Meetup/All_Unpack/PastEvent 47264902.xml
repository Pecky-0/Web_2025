&lt;p&gt;"Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great and the full menu will be available for purchase. Owners Lisa and Dan have offerred us a section of the first floor bar area to watch the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early&amp;nbsp;and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing as the Patriots play in the AFC Championship Game. We watched the Patriots beat the Broncos here last month.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people will stay for the NFC Championship game that begins at 6:30pm.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
