THINK AGAIN. A thought-provoking exploration into punk rock's evolution with questions you'll be debating long after this engaging rock doc has ended&amp;quot; -- The Washington Post&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punk's Not Dead takes you into the sweaty underground clubs, backyard parties, recording studios, and yes, shopping malls and stadium shows where punk rock music and culture continue to thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years after bands like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols infamously shocked the system with their hard, fast, status-quo-killing rock, the longest-running punk band in history is drawing bigger crowds than ever, ?pop-punk? bands have found success on MTV, and kids too young to drive are forming bands that carry the torch for punk's raw, immediate sound. Meanwhile, ?punk? has become a marketing concept to sell everything from cars to vodka, and dyed hair and piercings mark a rite of passage for thousands of kids. Can the true, nonconformist punk spirit still exist in today's corporatized culture?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring interviews, performances, and behind-the-scenes journeys with the bands, labels, fans, and press who keep punk alive, Punk's Not Dead dares to juxtapose pop-punk's music and lifestyle against the roots in&lt;br /&gt;the 70s and 80s, resulting in unexpected revelations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A DIY search for the soul of a subculture and a celebration of all things loud, fast, and spiked, Punk's Not Dead shows punk is stronger and more relevant today than it's ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater after the show. Then, we'll head off to a local thai place for food and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185752137000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183242841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Punk's Not Dead!</name><id>5957711</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185579000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5957711/</event_url></item>
