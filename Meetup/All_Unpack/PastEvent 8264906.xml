They serve innovative salads and pizzas, and have good beer, wine and desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the Details from last time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boycotted Za for a year after it opened, stupidly thinking it was just a pretentious pizza joint. Well they do serve pizza, but it's not a joint, and the food is unlike anything you've ever experienced. And it's good! Fare is simple: they have pizza, they have little mounds they call salads (which I particularly love) and they have beer/wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their web site is: www.zarestaurant.com &lt;br /&gt;Pizzas are perhaps $15 and Salads perhaps $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is easy in Arlington.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Meetup group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Harold</member_name><member_id>5109349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216159811000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-625</urlname><id>824450</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Food Snobs Unite (FSU) - Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215026900000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get Za'd</name><id>8264906</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215986400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-625/events/8264906/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/4/global_2985684.jpeg</photo_url></item>
