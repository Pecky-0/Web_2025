Most of the beach in the refuge will be closed April 1st for the spring and summer to provide undisturbed nesting and feeding habitat for the piping plover.  The seven day forecast for Saturday is sunny with temps in the mid 40's.   It will be low tide at 8:40am for easier walking.  We can meet at the Parker River headquarters parking lot so we can enter in vehicles that have season passes, unless you want to pay the $5.00 per vehicle fee.  After the hike some may find it interesting to check out the headquarters visiting center to learn more about the refuge's mission in protecting wild life.  Also, if anyone is interested we can go for lunch and/or drinks following the hike.  FYI - There are no dogs allowed inside the refuge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the Headquarters Parking lot in my green Toyota 4Runner</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>8103242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237648639000</updated><rating><average>4.82000017166</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236731268000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk The Beach At The Parker River Refuge (Plum Island)</name><id>9927403</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237039200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/9927403/</event_url></item>
