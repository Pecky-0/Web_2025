In particular will be a discussion of sticking points that have recurred from past shows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, the Ensemble will move into a repertoire of warm ups and drills that work to hone fundamental and advanced skills. This rehearsal will also serve as an opportunity to learn and practice a new set of games. Based on the outcome of this rehearsal, a new lineup will be devised for the Ensemble's upcoming show at Somerville Home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members who did not perform in a particular previous show are asked to review the show notes that correspond to this performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please communicate with Jason for more details about this rehearsal and to confirm your attendance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>22 Spalding Street Apt. 3, Jamaica Plain</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273190612000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ensemble A Rehearsal</name><id>13409076</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273420800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/13409076/</event_url></item>
