(If someone wants to write "Meetup" largely  on a piece of paper and arrive a few minutes early, that might help everyone to know where the group is gathering.) As there will be no official organizer present, everyone will be responsible for purchasing their own tickets.  After the movie ends, attendees can gather to determine where they would like to go for a bite to eat and those who wish to go may do so, to chat or to discuss the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
