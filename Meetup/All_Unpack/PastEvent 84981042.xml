&lt;p&gt;We wanted to give you advance notice of a special speaker for the December Meeting - Warren Tuttle, President of the United Inventors Association, will be speaking at our December 5th, 2012 meeting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren has worked behind the scenes on some very successful kitchenware products, such as the Smart Spin (8 million units sold) and the MISTO gourmet olive-oil sprayer (4 million units sold). As a marketing expert, he consults for large corporations, helping them become more innovative. He also speaks at national events, such as the International Home &amp;amp; Housewares Show - we are truly lucky to snag him for our meeting......please get the word out to your friends and associates! Remember, the public is now invited FREE to these open meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 This is a repeat -- the last time Warren was presenting, the wind-ripped-out trees all over the roads prevented most people from attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We record audio from our open meetings - and have a Podcast series, which you can find on itunes at the following link: &lt;br /&gt;
