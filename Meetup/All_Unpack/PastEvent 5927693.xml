Here is the description from the MFA calendar:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blame It on Fidel (La Faute รก Fidel) by Julie Gavras (France, 2006, 99 min.). Set in 1970, Blame It on Fidel is a wry and engaging look at how personal the political becomes in the life of one nine-year-old girl. Fernando (Stefano Accorsi) and Marie (Julie Depardieu) are left-leaning and very comfortably upper-middle class. A trip to Latin America convinces both to dedicate themselves full-time to the many causes they have only verbally supported. Soon they have moved out of their large house and into a small apartment, to the consternation of their daughter, Anna. Full of wonderful historical asides and period detail, Blame It on Fidel is about that moment when parents realize that their children are their own separate selves?and the moment when children discover the same thing about their parents. In the crucial role of Anna, Nina Kervel is a revelation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are surprisingly few reviews available for (even) French movies without a large distribution in the US . And while some critics found this movie a  bit  sentimental, most of the reviews were favorable. Here's a link to one: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/awards_festivals/fest_reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;amp;rid=8733" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hollywoodr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are no restaurants near the MFA that take  reservations, I'll be limiting the number of RSVP's to 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is the custom, Tom will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row before we head out to one of the small places to knosh and discuss along  Huntington Ave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185660521000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182644896000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blame it on Fidel- A 9 Year-Old Girl is not Impressed!</name><id>5927693</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185487200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5927693/</event_url></item>
