Sunday Matinees showcase a sampling of new and award-winning German films rarely shown outside Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket Price: All $5 (Can't beat that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Nacht vor Augen:&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five-year-old David (Hanno Koffler) returns to his home village in the Black Forest from a Bundeswehr (German Army) mission in Afghanistan. His girlfriend Kirsten (Petra Schmidt-Schaller) and his mother are overjoyed to see him safe and well and his shy eight-year-old brother is full of admiration for him. But David is close-mouthed, brusque, and not the same man he was before the mission. He is plagued by an inner turmoil; he canâ€™t get the war he has left behind out of his head and nobody wants to hear about it. Only his young brother who begs David to become his soccer coach, gets a glimpse of the horror when the sports training quickly turns violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her feature debut, Bertele succeeds in laying bare the psychic conditions and traumas of her protagonist and to show unconscious mechanisms of suppression. (2008, Germany) dir.
