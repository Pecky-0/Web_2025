<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event has been in the works for a little while, and I finally heard back from Ilene.  She is a consultant for the Traveling Vineyard.  The potluck starts at 7pm and the wine tasting and class begins at 7:30.  That way, we are not all getting up to get food while she is trying to teach us about wine.  When you RSVP, please indicate what you will be bringing for food.  That would be most helpful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the discription of what she will be doing and teaching:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bring the wine, glasses, and education. &lt;br /&gt;Experience a variety of wines, wine accessories and a tasting lesson, complete with tasting notes and food pairing suggestions, just like world-famous wineries and vineyards - It's easy, fun and informative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will bring 5 bottles of different wines for us to try and for her to teach about.  I personally know nothing about wine, so I'm excited to learn more and maybe finally develop a taste for it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is her website:  &lt;a href="http://www.myttv.com/ilene7626" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myttv.com/...&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to mingle, drink, and be educated all at the same time!  :0)  See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tammy (&amp;amp; Jay)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please ring the doorbell on the left.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tammy </member_name><member_id>7303013</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258330164000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256246254000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck and Wine Tasting/Class</name><id>11689030</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258156800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/11689030/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
