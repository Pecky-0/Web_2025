Have you ever experienced the awesome displays and packs of costumed children that descend on Beacon Hill on this special night?  Do you want to hear a bunch of stories about murder and mayhem on Beacon Hill?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to the first and last questions, this is the event for you.  If you answered &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to the second question, then this is a can't-miss experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk the dark side on All Hallows' Eve and there's no better place to do it than on a guided tour of Beacon Hill. Hear stories of ghosts, murders and mayhem that haunt this quiet neighborhood. Walk among elaborate ghostly decorations and the tons of people who come to Beacon Hill every year to celebrate.  This ninety-minute tour will highlight Beacon Hill's rich heritage of mystery and suspense. See the home of the murdered George Parkman and learn what happened to his dismembered body. You'll also find out about haunted courthouses, murdered lovers, hanged witches, stranglers, creative uses of human skin, and more death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fine print:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour starts promptly at 5:30pm and it's one of Boston By Foot's most popular tours.  There will be a ton of people, so please show up around 5pm in order to find the nerd pack, pay for your tickets, and get organized.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour starts from the front steps of the MA State House.  It's that big building with the gold dome overlooking the Common.  Park Street is the closest T stop.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there on the steps gathering the nerds.  I'll be wearing a Meetup button and handing out Meetup stickers.  I may or may not be wearing a giant purple hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets for the tour are $15 ($5 for card-carrying Boston By Foot members) and are purchased in cash, on site, before the tour.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costumes optional but you won't be nerdy if you wear one!  Unless you dress up as a nerd, but let's face it, then it's not a costume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour is only 90 minutes long, so you'll have plenty of time to see Beacon Hill and then go to a grown-up party!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257196264000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256137115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beacon Hill with a Boo! with Boston By Foot</name><id>11677839</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1257022800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11677839/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/c/global_5645308.jpeg</photo_url></item>
