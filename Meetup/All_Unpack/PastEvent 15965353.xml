You might want some sort of hiking pole(s) or maybe some sort of traction devices if we end up on some of the shorter hilly sections.  As there is supposed to be some fresh snow fall on Friday night and Saturday who knows how much the main trails will be snow packed from one day of people hiking there.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least with the fresh snow fall it will be hard to get lost if we blaze any new trails.  We can simply follow our tracks back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can wait under the power lines for people to show up so as not to bother other people.  If you get there late we will be starting the hike by 10:40 AM.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The parking area is at the end of Hickory Hill Drive which is a fairly short road.  The trail head and power lines is easily visible from the parking lot.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294616064000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294452305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Musquash Sunday</name><id>15965353</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294587000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/15965353/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/f/global_19083919.jpeg</photo_url></item>
