&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our last meet up our amico Ralph(lives in Cheshire)had extended to us an invitation to a grande meetup event at his home which will include 3 other meetup groups. Since there is a large number already going, the invitation is open to only 12 of us. I'm in! :) You will need to bring your own wine glass, since there will be a good bunch of people attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from Ralph. For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine or 1.75MLs please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvres or desert. One group is setting up a fondue station so you can bring stuff to dunk in the cheese. Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up. If you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more with your dish. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste. Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing. Reds - Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, shiraz pinot noir. Whites - sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a persons spot if you do not show up. If you must cancel, the earlier the better if there is a waiting list. *Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence. It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly. I will have water and coffee too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorenzo</member_name><member_id>4408109</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316357707000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Amici Italiani</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-452</urlname><id>535327</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313971717000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Serata con Vino in 4 Part Harmony! :)  Sat.
