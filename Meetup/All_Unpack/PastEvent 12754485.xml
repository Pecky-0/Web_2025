It does have a couple of short steep sections but all in all,  this is a great hike if you want to get a little more cardio than a walk in the woods....and the views are really spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan on at least 3 hours for the hike, bring a lunch and plenty of water for you and your dog.   If the temperature is in the 60's to 70's,   bring at least 32 ounces of water.   If it is warmer than this,   bring at least 48 ounces of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking poles will really help your knees on the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can either take 93 North (from the Manchester/Concord areas)  to Route 3 and Route 11 (directions from Google Maps when click on link for event location at top of this page)...or you can take  Route 28 (from Hooksett NH area)  to Alton bay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailhead is 4 miles north of the southern end of Lake Winnepesauke on Route 11. &lt;br /&gt;Big parking lot up slight hill just off route 11.  Can't miss the parking lot.....it's very visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be nice to have a pot-luck picnic at the summit.  So when you rsvp,  please be sure to answer the questions so we know who is bringing what.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights:  Cliffs, Scenic view of Lake Winnipesaukee &lt;br /&gt;Near: Alton Bay, NH  &lt;br /&gt;Distance: 3.8 miles round trip &lt;br /&gt;Elevation Gain: 1124 ft &lt;br /&gt;Hike Time: 2.5 to 3.0 hours  &lt;br /&gt;Difficulty: Moderate  (due to steep sections)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add more details for this event as we get closer and also start a list of who is bringing what so we can determine what else we need for our special picnic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/6/9/b/event_13418555.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Cute Beagle Screaming  Over Here......Over Here !!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judi-Judi-Judi</member_name><member_id>7477606</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272380814000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267515950000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Mount Major then Picnic Lunch with a view</name><id>12754485</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272207600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/12754485/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/b/global_13418587.jpeg</photo_url></item>
