NY Times  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay- it took a few extra months to get to Boston, we're in no hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;88% Rating on Rotten Tomatoes- please note their consensus concludes &lt;b&gt;The Sun is not for the impatient&lt;/b&gt;, Aleksandr Sokurov's &lt;b&gt;deliberately paced&lt;/b&gt; look at Hirohito in the waning days of World War II is both enlightening and admirable in its restraint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the summer of 1945 and the world is in upheaval. The Americans are preparing to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They have already launched a night raid on Tokyo that killed more than 100,000 people and destroyed much of the city. As Japan burns, Emperor Hirohito potters around, writing poetry and studying marine biology. The Imperial Palace may have been destroyed but there are still peacocks in the garden and his lab remains intact. A slight, moustached man whose official name is 'Showa' (Enlightened Peace), he has a child-like innocence. Edinburgh Sight and Sound&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Finely observed, exquisitely shot and immaculately performed, &lt;b&gt;The Sun&lt;/b&gt; portrays a tormented leader redeemed by his own adaptability.  Film 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue of Hirohito's complicity in war crimes is hardly even broached by Sokurov. &amp;quot;This is not a documentary and not a political film,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;We all know what happened to Japan: Japan was very aggressive, invaded other countries and had to pay the price. What I was interested in was the art, the life and the people.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Russian director spent ten years visiting Japan in preparation for the project. &amp;quot;Only gradually did I start to understand this character. I was attracted by this person as an individual and as a historical figure....What &lt;b&gt;The Sun&lt;/b&gt; does deliver is a closely focused character study. In dragging a figure still regarded with reverence by the Japanese so close to the public gaze, Sokurov risked controversy - after all, many Japanese committed suicide when Hirohito renounced his god-like status and called for surrender. But when &lt;b&gt;The Sun&lt;/b&gt; screened in Berlin in February the Japanese responded warmly.
