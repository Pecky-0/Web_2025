For this November event, the organizers hope to double that number by packaging 20,000 meals to distribute during Thanksgiving week through the Kids Care program. The event will include refreshments and facilitated dialogue on what motivates people of different faith and philosophical convictions to engage in service work. Since this is a public event, I am encouraging members of the Boston Atheists to attend and contribute to the good works.
