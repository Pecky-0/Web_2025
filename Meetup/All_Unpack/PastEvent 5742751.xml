Four on the Floor was the band we heard at our last event at the Princeton. Great music and we had alot of fun! Carpools can be set up for anyone not familiar with the location. Let's meet to eat and chat before the place gets too busy and the band plays. If the weather is nice there are also tables out on the front porch. Please rsvp your interest so we can make other plans if no one wants to go here. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179103127000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
