It is so sensitive, so powerful, so scientific so deep and yet so simple that even a person with no prior Yoga experience can easily practice it and derive benefit.Its subtle yogic warm ups with gentle stretching, breathing, and relaxation, result in a healthy body and mind. The other beautiful and more important aspect of Gentle Yoga is that  each and every part of the body including each organ, each joint and each muscle is taken into consideration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This session of Yoga will be followed by a guided meditation. The  meditation practice helps reduction of stress, tension, anxiety and frustration, as well as improved memory, concentration, inner peace and whole body well-being.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;No prior experience of Yoga practice is required to attend this session. It would be beneficial to the participants if they had a light meal 3-4 hours prior to the Yoga session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This would be a donation based meet-up  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jonas </member_name><member_id>6751445</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>prabhu</member_name><member_id>10149115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292702071000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-542</urlname><id>1021017</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Art of Living, New Haven</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289240795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gentle Yoga and Meditation</name><id>15380553</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289680200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-542/events/15380553/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/b/3/global_13060275.jpeg</photo_url></item>
