(chk chk chk) and the Field playing at the Paradise this Friday, October 12. This is going to be a very high energy show with a lot of dancing involved (if you want to dance that is). I want to meetup with some of you finally and actually make this group happen, which is why i'm inviting you over to my lovely garden apartment in Brighton on Friday before the show. My apartment is right off the B line close to the Warren stop, which is about a 15-20 minute walk to the club or a short T ride. The party will start at 6:30ish and will last until about 8:30 or until we decide to head to the show. It will be BYOB, but i'll have some free drinks and food to munch on before the show. Feel free to invite guests to the party and show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting your tickets before the event as it may sell out. They are available at ticketmaster.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/01003EF29FC08731?artistid=919340&amp;amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;amp;minorcatid=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ticketmast...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out some of !!! music on their myspace page&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/chkchkchk" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send out an e-mail to the people who RSVP of directions and address of my apartment as well as my cell phone number to call once you are close to my place. Looking forward to meeting you guys, if you have any questions of comments about the meetup, let me know. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194631890000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191862965000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>!!!
