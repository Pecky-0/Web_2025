As Captain America, he crosses paths with The Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), an evil scientist working to advance the Nazi agenda over the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this movie is good. It's about time Captain America had a good movie. The trailers look terrific. Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones are in it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain America opens on July 22. The movie starts at 7:00 PM. Let's meet in the lobby of Showcase Cinema in Worcester at 6:30. If you need to reach me, call my cell phone at 508-981-0455.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to stick around for a special closing scene at the end of the credits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my photo, but with a goatee</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1311435817000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Captain America is an awesome superhero.
