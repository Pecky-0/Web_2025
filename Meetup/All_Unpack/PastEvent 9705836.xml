This Meetup is now in session!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, hi, everybody. Please don't mind Mike's formality - he's just trying to get into the spirit for our upcoming &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; Meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, your peers have been polled, opinions opined, and a decision delivered! On Friday, February 20th at 6:00, we will be sequestering ourselves in &lt;a href="http://thejuryroom.us/" target="_blank"&gt;The Jury Room&lt;/a&gt; in Quincy Center!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A relatively recent addition to the Quincy dining scene, The Jury Room is located on the corner of Chestnut Street and Cottage Avenue. Its name and theme are inspired by the Quincy Courthouse that sits essentially across the street (Chestnut Street ends at this point for no obvious reason and becomes Dennis Ryan Parkway: The courthouse's address is 1 Dennis Ryan Parkway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This case has featured hearsay aplenty concerning an urbane, yet not-too-serious atmosphere and a sophisticated, yet still pub grub menu but, as always, our members demand hard evidence. Please join us in Quincy Center as we convene to get the tasty facts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jury Room&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;39 Cottage Ave., Quincy&lt;br /&gt;(617) 328-7234&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://thejuryroom.us/" target="_blank"&gt;http://thejuryroom.us...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, February 20th @ 6pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizers:&lt;/b&gt; Mike and Angela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maximum number of attendees: 12!&lt;/b&gt; What else?! Sorry, but seating at tables is limited here! If you want to attend but we already have 12 Yes RSVP's, please RSVP and use the Waiting List function - Alternate diners will be impaneled in the order in which they've responded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Sorry, &lt;b&gt;Members Only&lt;/b&gt; at this event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price Range:&lt;/b&gt; Dining Menu entrees range from $12 to $27. There is also a less expensive bar menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash Only Policy:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over two years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, February 19th @ 7:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; As noted above, The Jury Room is located at 39 Cottage Avenue, on the corner of Chestnut St and Cottage Ave. Some of you may remember this space from its former incarnation as Kelly's Restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jury Room is the last in a row of businesses whose rear entrances open onto the municipal parking lot whose entrance is located across from the Quincy Courthouse at 1 Dennis Ryan Parkway. If you are in the parking lot, facing the rear of the buildings, The Jury Room is the last building on the right.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Our reservation is under both 'Mike' and 'South Shore Meetup Group'.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Angela</member_name><member_id>341074</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike</member_name><member_id>3444655</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236466517000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234200401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Food Noir!</name><id>9705836</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235170800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/events/9705836/</event_url></item>
