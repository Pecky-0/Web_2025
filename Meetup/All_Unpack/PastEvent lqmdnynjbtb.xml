What opportunites are lost?  &lt;u&gt;What are you creating and not creating?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this month's meetup, we’ll be discussing the topic of &lt;b&gt;“This delicious moment: the power of being present and in the now”&lt;/b&gt;.  We’ll be addressing questions like:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• What does it mean to be present and how do you do it?  &lt;br /&gt;• What are the benefits of being mindful and present in the now? &lt;br /&gt;• How does it relate to law of attraction?  Will it make manifesting what I want easier?  &lt;br /&gt;• And any other questions you might have.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’ll also be guiding you through two powerful guided meditations to get you deeply present.  One of them is called “This delicious moment” and it involves real food! The other is a hand meditation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to join us in this experience and masterminding event:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. RSVP YES on our meetup site &lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Bring a food for yourself that you really enjoy and can use for the guided meditation. (Ideas: chocolate, fruit, a piece of pastry – something you can really get your senses into.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to RSVP, and after you do so,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; let us know if your plans change, so we won’t be waiting for you unnecessarily or wasting handouts and snacks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun.
