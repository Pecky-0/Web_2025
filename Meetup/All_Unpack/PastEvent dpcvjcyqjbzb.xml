&lt;p&gt;If you are a Captain, or consider being a captain, or you just want to know some Captains (with boats); you may want to consider joining the NECBA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet monthly (on the third Tuesday of the month) at Winthrop Yacht Club. New members welcome. $50 for Captains. $25 for Associate Members. Feel free to attend the first meeting and check us out. Join us at the Yacht Club bar and consider becoming a New England Charter Boat Association member.&lt;/p&gt;
