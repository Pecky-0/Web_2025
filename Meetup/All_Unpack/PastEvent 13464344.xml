And -- random trivia alert!-- does anyone remember Ann Guilbert from the old Dick Van Dyke Show?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the film:&lt;br /&gt;Please Give is writer/director Nicole Holofcener's (Friends with Money, Lovely &amp;amp; Amazing) perceptive—and devastatingly funny—take on modern life's contradictions, good intentions and shaky moral bearings. Kate (Catherine Keener), Alex (Oliver Platt) and their teenage daughter Abby (Sarah Steele) purchase the apartment next door in order to expand their two bedroom Manhattan apartment. Their only problem is Andra (Ann Guilbert), the cranky old lady living in it, and that they've got to wait for her to die. Andra is cared for by her sweet granddaughter Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) who has no life, and is blatantly rejected by her other granddaughter, the highly cynical Mary (Amanda Peet). Simply waiting for Andra to die becomes complicated when the two families' lives intersect, resulting in a dramatic comedy about love, death and liberal guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The movie doesn’t tell a story so much as observe from an affectionate distance as its characters dither and forgive, desperate for solace without looking like a sap. “Please Give’’ is a moral comedy that feels at times like one of the late Eric Rohmer’s deceptively breezy miniatures, or a mid-period Woody Allen movie minus the fussiness.&amp;quot; 31/2 stars - Ty Burr, Boston Globe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;With Keener's unique ability to portray characters who are simultaneously blunt (and even abrasive) but also soft and vulnerable, the actress has become the embodiment of a Holofcener woman. More than that, with their shared characteristics of sex, age, motherhood, and brunet hair, Keener has become Holofcener's artistic alter ego. In Please Give, the sharp-eyed filmmaker sends her vibrant representative out into the world to explore what it means for a woman to be lucky and still feel itchy. The report has the resonant ring of truth.&amp;quot; Grade: A-  -- Entertainment Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the film I'll be near the front of the theater holding a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273695588000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Please Give</name><id>13464344</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273954500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/13464344/</event_url></item>
