Located on the corner of School and Hancock Streets on Route 53 at the south end of Quincy Center, Finian's offers a wide variety of food sure to please everyone's palate.  Wednesday nights features a &amp;quot;Dinner for 2&amp;quot; for $14.95/duo featuring 20 different menu items.  This allows each person to choose their meal from 20 options, providing a delicious meal for only $7.50/person.  You can pair up with someone to take advantage of the &amp;quot;Dinner for 2&amp;quot; or you can go your own way and choose from many of the meals, appetizers, and salads offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great opportunity to meet and get to know each other, as well as talk about different foods, restaurants, and meals we enjoy.  This will also be a great time to plan our next Dining Out event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see our &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; page for full details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring cash.  You are responsible for your portion of the meal, including but not limited to, your drinks, food, tax, and tip and any shared items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Please Note: This event has been pushed back from Monday, September 18th.***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Angela</member_name><member_id>341074</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159920661000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157990342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group Kick-Off Meetup!</name><id>5124418</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158790500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/events/5124418/</event_url></item>
