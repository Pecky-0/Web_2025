Beginning Oct 23, the MFA and the Goethe-Institut will be presenting a retrospective of  8 of her films. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters in this German romantic comedy that follows a 30-year old single woman searching for love, have a distinctly Felliniesque quality to them. Fanny Fink desperately wants a man. Her closest male friend is Orfeo, a gay con-man who claims to be a self-taught African witch doctor. For a price, Orfeo agrees to conjure up Fanny's dream lover. All Movie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobody Loves Me&lt;/b&gt; is one of those rare comedies that works on many levels. It provokes a few genuine chuckles, but its humor is smarter than it is belly-laugh-inducing. Elements of the plot are thoroughly realistic, down-to-earth and surreal, spiritual. Nearly any adult can relate to Fanny Fink, a 29-year-old attractive woman who frisks airline passengers for a living, and yet the film allows you to marvel at the journey she undergoes because it exaggerates the poetry of everyday life. Although the film's sensibility is rooted in the present, its mix of absurdity and pathos recalls such 1970s cult classics such as Hal Ashby’s Harold and Maude in its mix of quirky farce and gentle social commentary.

She chronicles love, life and death with wit, humor and an unmistakable lightness. This comprehensive retrospective spans her work form her breakthrough hit comedy Men (1985), to the “relationship films” of the nineties (Am I Beautiful?, 1998, Nobody Loves Me, 1994), dealing with the realities humans inflict on one another. Reflecting Dörrie’s fascination with Buddhism, Zen and Japan are her latest films: Enlightenment Guaranteed (1999), How to Cook Your Life (2007), and Cherry Blossoms (2008). &lt;br /&gt;Doris Dörrie is a graduate of the Munich Academy of Film and Television where she teaches today, and also studied at the New School for Social Research in New York. She is also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and books for children.
