<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are having our second official meetup.  Sorry to anyone who came last month - there was a family emergency and we were unable to hold the meetup!  But now we are back on track and I hope that everyone will join us for an afternoon of fun.  We are meeting at Best Friends Pet Care in Boxford, MA.  Hopefully the weather will still be nice for us to play outside in the pool, but if it happens to be too cold or rainy, there is a large indoor play room that we can use also.  It will be great during the winter months coming up as well!  I hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542324000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191693738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs November Meetup</name><id>6501106</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194717600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/6501106/</event_url></item>
