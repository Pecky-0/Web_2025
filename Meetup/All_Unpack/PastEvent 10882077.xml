So why not take control of your website as well?  In this day and age, most new clients will find your business through the internet.  So you need to establish as prominent an online presence as possible.  This presentation covers how to get near the top of the search engine rankings for the relevant keywords in your area, how to track visitors to your site and to your blog, how to design a website that stands out from the competition, and how to efficiently advertise on the web. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paul Nguyen&lt;/b&gt; runs his own practice as a Certified Consulting Hypnotist in Maynard, MA.  He helps clients to take control of their lives and achieve goals such as stress reduction, overcoming anxieties, healthier living, increasing confidence, and habit removal.  And, yes, he designs and runs his own website, online store, podcast, blog, and web ads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetings begin with a potluck lunch and time to get to know everyone in the group a bit better.  Please let us know what you will bring to the potluck when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup fee: $10&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will welcome you at the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256248864000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247670803000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name><id>10882077</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255102200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/10882077/</event_url></item>
