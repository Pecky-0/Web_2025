Did it ever occur to you that Facebook is written in PHP? The secrets were &lt;a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?story=358&amp;amp;blog=1" target="_blank"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; recently from Facebook developers as HipHop for PHP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HipHop for PHP is a source code transformer. HipHop programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it. HipHop executes the source code in a semantically equivalent manner and sacrifices some rarely used features such as eval() in exchange for improved performance. HipHop includes a code transformer, a reimplementation of PHP's runtime system, and a rewrite of many common PHP Extensions to take advantage of these performance optimizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us on April 26th as Scott MacVicar from Facebook takes us through HipHop and how you might potentially use it for your high demand web applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Space is limited to 50 attendees, if you are planning to attend, you must RSVP now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a parking garage very close by on Washington street (&lt;a href="http://www.pialleygarage.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Pi Alley&lt;/a&gt;). Please plan ahead with enough ample time to be there and grab your seat. Doors sometimes close just after 7pm, so don't be stuck - get their early. There is a great bookstore accross the street that you can visit if you come before 6:30pm. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Murphy</member_name><member_id>4790321</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Bourque</member_name><member_id>5046031</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Drane</member_name><member_id>8266401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1277230867000</updated><rating><average>4.78999996185</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>50</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271632816000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>HipHop for PHP - How does Facebook do it!</name><id>13219000</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272322800000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/13219000/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/d/global_14468781.jpeg</photo_url></item>
