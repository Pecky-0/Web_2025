This event is sponsored by Holyoke Community College and they are offering an introduction before the film as well as an opportunity to stay for a discussion afterwards.  This is the only screening, so I suggest you purchase your ticket in advance.  The movie is at 7:30pm, let's meet in the lobby at 7:10 pm if you'd like to sit together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some info on the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of her 80th birthday, Agnès Varda, often referred to as “the godmother of the French New Wave,” &lt;br /&gt;decided to make the autobiographical The Beaches of Agnes.

Richly illustrating her &lt;br /&gt;documentary with clips from her (and Demy’s) films, Varda remains a constant, lively presence, remarking of &lt;br /&gt;her on-screen persona, “I’m playing the role of a little old lady, plump and talkative.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Romy</member_name><member_id>8392408</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316475900000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernmassfrenchclub</urlname><id>1101087</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Western Mass French Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284478672000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Soiree Cinema: Les Plages d'Agnes</name><id>14766306</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288134900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernmassfrenchclub/events/14766306/</event_url></item>
