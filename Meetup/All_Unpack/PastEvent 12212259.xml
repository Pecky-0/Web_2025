Meet new friends who share your interest in improving or maintaining language skills. This (mostly) Spanish conversation is a fiesta. Bring a SMALL amount of food to share. If you can, let us know in your RSVP what you'll bring. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the meetups will be potlucks with conversation and some will have a theme or event. We are seeking meetup ideas and presenters for the theme meetups. If you can present a program for one of our meetups, please contact Karen or Kurt. Perhaps you could lead a poetry reading, present a game night in Spanish, teach Latin Dancing, speak about a country where Spanish is spoken, etc. Contact Karen at kdwo543210@yahoo.com or Kurt at gringo50@peru.com. Use the Message Board to discuss ideas and brainstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Â¡Nos vemos!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kurt Weingartner</member_name><member_id>8679708</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265758379000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262574404000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fiesta</name><id>12212259</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263340800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/12212259/</event_url></item>
