We play a wide range of music, from our specialty, Hebrew and Israeli music, all the way to classic Sinatra, Broadway and great rock and roll. In short, we'll have lots of fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come out and support Hal in his only public performances of the year. See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RANDOLPH GAZEBO&lt;br /&gt;JULY 1, Tuesday Evening 7:00-8:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;Hart Park, North and Pleasant Sts, Randolph, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  RT 128 to Exit 5, RT28S, Randolph.
