Tonight we will be meeting at Canobie Lake Park in Salem, New Hampshire to enjoy a little bit of Halloween frights at their Spooky World set up.  The price of general admission is $22.99.  We will be meeting at 7:00 P.M. at the ticket office (if anybody knows of a better location such as a McDonalds, convience store, etc. nearby that would be more convenient and I will notify people).  I will be wearing a yellow baseball cap and a black down vest.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that costumes are not allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please visit the WEB Site for additonal information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This promises to be a most interesting night........  Be prepared to be scared!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>DIANNE AND I WILL BE IN A BLACK FOUR DOOR ECHO WITH MAINE PLATES</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224457729000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223035248000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SPOOKY WORLD AT CANOBIE LAKE PARK</name><id>8887451</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224284400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8887451/</event_url></item>
