This is more of a walk than a hike, although there is a decent view from Eagle Rock. If people are feeling more ambitious, there's always Ridge Trail. We'll be meeting at the &lt;b&gt;Vocational School&lt;/b&gt; parking lot - that's the Wakefield side. Email me if you need directions or get lost. This should be a great first meetup where people can take a leisurely walk and get to know each other. The more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting at the gate</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285720530000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220328075000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakheart Hike</name><id>8667904</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221087600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/8667904/</event_url></item>
