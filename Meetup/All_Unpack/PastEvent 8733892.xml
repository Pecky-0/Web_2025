So let's meet between 6:15 and 6:30, then head in to buy tickets ($8.50 for FMM members and their guests, not $10 -- YAY for discounts!) and food ($3 for small popcorn; $3 for small soda -- or credit toward larger) and grab seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's lots of us, so I'll be counting people a lot to make sure we're all here. If you can't make it last minute (and have RSVPed yes) OR if you've RSVPed maybe and can make it OR if you've not RSVPed, but want to come, CALL MY CELL AT 508-308-4897. If you'll be late or need direx to the theater, please call me, too. I'm here for ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all tomorrow night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;Movie Fan John just informed me that this is taking place on &amp;quot;Talk like a Pirate Day.&amp;quot; You know what that means... Feel free to dress up (or wear an eye patch!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get together for a comedy. A Coen Brothers comedy, nonetheless, so it's pretty much guaranteed to keep you entertained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome. Just include them in the RSVP so I know how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: The usual -- Framingham 16.&lt;br /&gt;Time: Around 7 (I'll update that week with an exact time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to RSVP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on the 19th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell (for last-minute RSVPs or &amp;quot;I'm lost!&amp;quot; calls): 508/308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222295225000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221097432000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Burn After Reading</name><id>8733892</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221865200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/8733892/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
