We will have the private room at the Lansdowne Pub to ourselves. I will bring games, but feel free to bring your favorite board or card games with you. This will be a great night, so be sure to join us! Each guest is reponsible for the cost of their own food/drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no Sox home game on this night, so parking should be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a joint event with Boston Cards &amp;amp; Conversation Meet Up group. Important Note: It is important that we have an accurate headcount, so if your plans change, be sure to update your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo)  inside the private room on the left.
