I started this long strange wasabi trip back in at the end of 2007 and the start of 2008.....So I figured why not come full circle....go back to the root of all this craziness.....Akasaka......They were always good to me there.....of course after this last debacle at Shangra-crap....I will check to make sure Akasaka has the same owners and a liqour permit.....So come if you can.....come if you will...for our last sushi of 2008.......even if you can't make it..... I thank everyone for making this a great year.....My wife and I have really enjoyed getting to know everyone......HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You know me.......??!?</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231710857000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228272724000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Santa Claus Sushi</name><id>9269897</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229295600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ct/events/9269897/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/b/global_5433467.jpeg</photo_url></item>
