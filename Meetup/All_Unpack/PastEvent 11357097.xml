Is it somehow different from a Spirit? And can either manifest itself onto our earthly plane of existence? Join A. J. Kitt, founder and lead investigator of the Seacoast Paranormal Research Group, and Isabeau Esby, internationally known Psychic Medium, as they discuss the realities of hauntings and what possibilities may lurk in any home, business, or graveyard!  Paranormal evidence, both audio and visual will be presented during the lecture from a variety of ghost investigations performed in the New England area.  Are you ready to see a ghost?  Hear the dead?  If you are, join us for this informative, humorous and sometimes eerie event.&lt;br /&gt;AJ Kitt, professional artist, Mensan, and founder of the Seacoast Paranormal Research Group, has a University of New Hampshire Bachelors degree in Journalism. Isabeau Esby, internationally known Psychic Medium, has a University of Minnesota degree in Mathematics.  Together, Isabeau and Andy lecture on Spiritualism and Paranormal activity, and with a team of investigators they test the validity of claims of paranormal activity across New England.&lt;br /&gt;Location -  Eye of the Hawk, 5 Grove Rd, Rye, NH 03870&lt;br /&gt;Date - Saturday, October 31st, 2009 &lt;br /&gt;Time - 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;Cost - $15 per person in advance, $25 per person at the door&lt;br /&gt;For more information and to purchase a ticket to this popular Halloween event, contact Eye of the Hawk at 603-964-7874, jo.catalino@eyeofthehawk.org or visit &lt;a href="http://www.eyeofthehawk.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.eyeofthehawk.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabeau Esby</member_name><member_id>5847842</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257210561000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252796445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ghosts and Spirits</name><id>11357097</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1257037200000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/11357097/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/1/global_2599441.jpeg</photo_url></item>
