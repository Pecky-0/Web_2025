They are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobody Knows My Name&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;by James Baldwin&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;by Steven Pressfield&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Please pick one book and come prepared to discuss your choice with others who have read it. (If you have the time and would like to read both you are welcome to do so)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobody Knows my Name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first group of eight essays focuses on the political and social divides in the United States. The opening article reiterates the discovery he made in &amp;quot;Notes of a Native Son&amp;quot;: that by living in Europe he paradoxically discovered what it means to be an American. Others examine the despicable inhumanity of a Harlem public housing project (&amp;quot;cheerless as a prison&amp;quot;), the success of the student movement and the rise of Muslim power in black politics (&amp;quot;a very small echo of the black discontent now abroad in the world&amp;quot;), and the first efforts to integrate Southern public schools (&amp;quot;the entire nation has spent a hundred years avoiding the question of the place of the black man in it&amp;quot;). The two most memorable essays detail the daily bravery, trauma, and humiliations of a schoolboy who is the first black in an all-white school and respond to Faulkner's despicable remarks on race (which were made when Faulkner was seemingly drunk and which were later repudiated when he was atypically sober). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gates of Fire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.&lt;br /&gt;Thus reads an ancient stone at Thermopylae in northern Greece, the site of one of the world's greatest battles for freedom. Here, in 480 B.C., on a narrow mountain pass above the crystalline Aegean, 300 Spartan knights and their allies faced the massive forces of Xerxes, King of Persia. From the start, there was no question but that the Spartans would perish. In Gates of Fire, however, Steven Pressfield makes their courageous defense--and eventual extinction--unbearably suspenseful.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have Meetup tents on the table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meagan</member_name><member_id>6521348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244849802000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241018366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May's Book Club Discussion: Gates of Fire or Nobody Knows My Name </name><id>10294121</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242772200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/10294121/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/1/global_8407617.jpeg</photo_url></item>
