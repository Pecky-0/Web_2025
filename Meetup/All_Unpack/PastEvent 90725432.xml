It's our annual tradition to usher in the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This walking tour is inspired by Samuel Eliot Morison's childhood memoir: &lt;em&gt;One Boy's Bosto&lt;/em&gt;n. Discover Morison's neighborhood on this stroll through one of Boston's least known and most delightful areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flat of Beacon Hill is built on 19th century made land along the Charles River. The Flat is geologically part of Back Bay and culturally part of Beacon Hill, with the architecture of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intimate patch os real estate soon acquired carriage houses and horse stables. Today, many of these buildings have been converted to charming residences and seamlessly blend among the notable landmarks such as the Charles Street Meeting House, the Church of the Advent, and the Sunflower Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do Sam 'Mayday' Malone, a fox terrier named Igloo, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis have in common? They all know the Flat is where it's at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour is $15 per person ($5 for Boston By Foot card-carrying members). See &lt;a&gt;www.bostonbyfoot.org&lt;/a&gt; for information about joining Boston By Foot.&lt;/p&gt;
