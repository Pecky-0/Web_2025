<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>To continue the tradition of Joanna's walks getting rained out, the weather forecast for Saturday is torrential rain. Since I am fighting a cold and I really need to go to work next week, I will not be walking. We will still meet for lunch at 1:15 at Captain Marden's restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to cancel, please update your RSVP so that someone else can enjoy the meal. If you really want to walk in the rain, let me know and I will meet you in the parking lot with trail maps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;781-237-6719, 781-956-2099 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;joannaeld@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just won a free lunch for 8 people at Captain Marden's Restaurant in Wellesley, so I figured what better way to enjoy it then with a group of my Meetup Walking Friends. I will decide on an exact walk when it gets closer to the event. I would like to walk around Lake Waban, but will only do that if the snow level is okay. If the snow is too deep, then we'll find a sidewalk route to take. In any case, it will be a nice walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please only RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; if you can commit to lunch. I do not want to hold a space and then not use it. The free lunch does have one catch and that is that we'll have to listen to a 5 minute presentation on Ameriprise's financial planning services. After that, we each will get a free meal and beverage. NOTE: Captain Mardens does not have a liquor license, so if you want beer or wine, you are welcome to BYOB. &lt;a href="http://captainmardens.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://captainmardens...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to walk, but skip lunch, RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; but put &amp;quot;Joining for walk&amp;quot; in the comment section so that we will look for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heavy rain or snow cancels walk, but not lunch. Blizzard will cancel lunch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joanna</member_name><member_id>4442725</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205164467000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Beautiful walk with a free lunch!</why><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199467675000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>There is such a thing as a free lunch!</name><id>7030713</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204991100000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7030713/</event_url></item>
