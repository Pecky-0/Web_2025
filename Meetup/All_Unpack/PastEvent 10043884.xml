The first 250 children chose pumpkins to decorate which were donated by a local farm. Tables were set up with markers, glue, paint, and lots of fun things to attach to their pumpkin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silly Willy was there to add a new hat design or two and Halloween-related music was played to get everyone in the mood.  Free family pictures were also supplied compliments of the Revere Beach Partnership.  Even for October, it was a perfect day to be on the beach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, 2009, the Revere Beach Partnership will be holding the second annual festival.  More details will be available as the date gets closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, you can check out the 1st annual event at www.reverebeach.com/RevereBeach_news_articles.htm#4&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Pavilion across from Kelly's</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>5274985</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256250143000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238101787000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach Pumpkin Festival</name><id>10043884</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255791600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/10043884/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/1/e/global_7847406.jpeg</photo_url></item>
