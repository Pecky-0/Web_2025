The original cost is $110, but zozi has a deal for $66 or $56. If you sign up using this link you &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.zozi.com/z/get_credit/c3wf"&gt;http://www.zozi.com/z/get_credit/c3wf&lt;/a&gt; you will get $10 credit...so upon your first purchase it will deduct $10. (I signed up using a different email account to get the $10 discount since I already have a zozi account). after you have a zozi account buy this deal &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.zozi.com/local/boston/5418"&gt;http://www.zozi.com/local/boston/5418&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soar through tree-top canopies during a three-hour zip line adventure. Learn safety procedures from talented course guides, get geared up and then hit the foliage. A 4x4 off-road buggy (yep, you read that right) will drive you to the nearby peak, and then the lines are yours for the zipping. Cross sky bridges, check out the views out over the Deerfield River Valley and the northern Berkshires, and let this thrilling adventure give you the exhilarating experience of a lifetime. And the kicker? Take home a t-shirt to prove you were there. So long canopy beds, hello canopy tours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get your voucher&lt;/p&gt;
