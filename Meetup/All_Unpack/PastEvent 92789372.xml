&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of doing 3 loops around trhe park which is approximately 3 miles, and we`ll do it at the fastest pace of the slowest walker, which basically means that it will be at a brisk pace, but that no one gets left behind. The park has a couple of nice little hills and is basically good exercise, and maybe walking will give us a chance to continue to do something active even as the weather gets a little colder. I would like to follow this up again with going to the Atwood Grille, which is going to be [posted as a second meetup.I am also organizing this with active singles.I will add that if people want to go to both events, that they will need to sign up for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk is going to be around 60-75 minutes, and we will have limited space at the Atwood Grille because of reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
