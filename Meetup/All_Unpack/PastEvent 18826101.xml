It's immediately next door to another favorite The Abbey Pub (corner of Admiral St. and River Ave). The hookah lounge also features a small but scrumptious menu of Lebanese and Mediterranean style food. They opened at the beginning of the year and now have a beer/wine license. The front is more of a sports bar atmosphere with tall tables but the back is a quiet lounge with cushions transporting you to another place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday May 25 from 7-9 they are hosting an Open House for the neighborhood. The manager tells me that there will be hookah and appetizer sampling. The parking lot adjacent to them is 'safe' even though signs say not to park. Plus there's ample street parking surrounding the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope some of you can make it. I'll be there so look for me or just come and meet new people or people watch. Let's try to support this new local business and take it over before college students really discover it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306369392000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305727194000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Elmhurst Neighborhood Hookah Lounge/Lebanese Restaurant Open House</name><id>18826101</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306364400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/18826101/</event_url></item>
