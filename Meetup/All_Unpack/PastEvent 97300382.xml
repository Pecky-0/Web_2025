&lt;p&gt;***Fair warning to those unfamiliar with this movie:  It is very dark and extremely violent.  Just so the curious minded know what they're getting into ;)***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we're past the holidays and now we've got a long, cold winter to get through.  Since we'll most likely be spending most our evenings hibernating on the couch, why not do it together?  Yay movie night!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the ongoing series &lt;span&gt;"new release night at Dan's", where ideally I will schedule the Meetup for the actual home video release date, or as close to that as possible dependent on when I am free.  While I may not have the roomiest place, I do have a very nice 60" plasma HDTV with a very good 5.1 surround sound system.  It is my hope that this will be your next best option to seeing a movie at your local megaplex, or close to it anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Millbury - just off routes 146, 90, and 20 - and will disclose the address and my contact info in a private email to the members who sign up. Please plan on arriving about 7:00 to get settled and chat a bit, and the movie starts at 7:30 sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel free to bring munchies and/or adult beverages for yourself and/or others, but please do not feel obligated to do so.  The assumption should be that people will have eaten a proper meal before they come over, and if that's not the case then by all means bring whatever.  I will make it a point to always make fresh popcorn for these movie nights but otherwise I expect nothing in return besides a good time had by all.  I'll have unlimited Brita-filtered water, yay!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a reminder I do have a cat. He will be locked away in the bedroom but just wanted to give you fair warning in case you're allergic.  I also have a private patio which smokers can feel free to use for a smoke break if they wish.  Just don't expect me to pause the movie while you do that ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all 6 slots are taken up, I recommend jumping on the waiting list and marking your calendars, since we all know plans change for people and folks may back out last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. - for the geeks out there, no this is not the 3D version.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan</member_name><member_id>41397892</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358364545000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357053964000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Release movie night at Dan's: Dredd</name><id>97300382</id><headcount>3</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358294400000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/97300382/</event_url></item>
