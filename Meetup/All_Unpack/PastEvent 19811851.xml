We are planning to picnic the summer away the last Saturday of every month through September. The potuck is a celebration of locally grown, seasonal food. You are invited to bring a potluck dish using as many locally grown ingredients as possible from your garden, CSA, Farmers&amp;rsquo; Market, farmstand or  local food artisan. Label your dish so we know what&amp;rsquo;s in it and who to thank. Also bring your beverage of choice: if it&amp;rsquo;s local brew and in a pitcher to share, even better. We will provide pitchers of refreshing local water.  We are aiming for a zero-waste event, so please bring your own &amp;ldquo;mess kits&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; non-disposable plate, cup, utensils and cloth napkin. Leftover vegetable waste will be composted.  Come along, bring the family, your potluck dish, beverage of choice, &amp;ldquo;mess kit&amp;rdquo;, a blanket or chair for seating and musical instruments. We&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to a fun time for all.  This event is a sponsored by the First Parish Church of Newbury, Greater Newburyport CSA, New Eden Collaborative, Northshore Permaculture Meetup and Transition Newburyport.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elizabeth </member_name><member_id>389569</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306689806000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306419918000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Local Flavor Community Potluck Picnic</name><id>19811851</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306614600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/19811851/</event_url></item>
