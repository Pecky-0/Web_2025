<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;#9658;&lt;b&gt;Update: We're going to meet on the football field instead (on the maps where it says &amp;quot;Russel Field&amp;quot;) because the baseball diamond is covered in snow holes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to meet at Russel Field this time for our Friday evening games of illuminated Ultimate Frisbee madness. We'll be meeting at 7pm and playing for a couple hours. Most likely we'll head over to a bar or restaurant afterwards to have drinks or food (Bertucci's, anyone?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those taking public transportation, follow the map to walk to Russel Field via the path from Alewife T Station, OR, take the 83 bus from either Porter or Central Square. For those driving, park in the public parking lot alongside the playing field. For those walking, wear a hat and gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/2062/russelfieldio5.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/2062/russelfieldio5.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://img246.imagesh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/3478/russelfieldpathqk8.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/3478/russelfieldpathqk8.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://img175.imagesh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to dress warmly. I have a couple extra pairs of hats and gloves that I'll bring just in case anyone doesn't have any. Even though we'll bring a first aid kit, be sure to wear light colored clothes and cleats if you have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll provide the glowsticks and frisbees. Feel free to email us with questions. See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be chasing illuminated frisbees like giddy moths.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim O'Neill</member_name><member_id>4585507</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelli</member_name><member_id>4908325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214939046000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>We're awesome... read the Bostonist article on the front page of our Meetup.</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199326429000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Illuminated Frisbee on Russel Field</name><id>7017823</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199491200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7017823/</event_url></item>
