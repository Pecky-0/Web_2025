<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Lets kick the summer off right with a long weekend of hikes, BBQ and bonfires! Saturday and Sunday will each have 2 hiking options - Moderate and advanced with an additional moderate-plus hike on Monday. Moderate hikes will be in the 4 to 5 mile range and the advanced will be around 9 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a great intro-weekend to the Wedeln Ski &amp;amp; Outdoor Club. If you have never been to our house then this is an ideal weekend to make your first visit. The Wedeln Ski House is located on the Bartlet / N. Conway town line. The house is tucked away half way up Hurricane Mountain and has hiking and biking trails right out the back side of the house. Accommodations are only $25 per night, bring your own bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still working on the hike and entertainment schedule. Possible hikes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moat Mountains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Pierce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Carrigain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Stairs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt. Kearsarge North&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details to come. We are also planning a cookout for Saturday night and will be requesting an additional $20 to help buy food for the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not use GPS to find house, you will get lost. Directions will be sent to all attendees.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George Fraley</member_name><member_id>10925592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337995310000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336532379000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Memorial Day Hiking Weekend</name><id>64027152</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337983200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/64027152/</event_url></item>
