Pagan Pride Day is fast approaching, and once again the MoonPool Coven will be hosting the Family/ Children's area! 
&lt;span&gt;More details to come as we get closer to the event, but here is the announcement about EMPPD from the website...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Witches, Druids and other Pagans Reclaim the Magic in Nature at Eastern Massachusetts Pagan Pride Day!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;On September 18, 2011, magical traditions from all over New England will gather&amp;nbsp;together on the field at Bradley Palmer State Park to connect with the powers of Mother Nature. Participants of this family-friendly event will enjoy educational workshops (including our Keynote speakers, Raven and Stephanie Grimassi, among many others), entertainment (this year we will host Kelliana, Jenna Greene, Christopher Lafond, and Featherscale), children's activities, and the bewitching wares of many vendors and craftspeople.&amp;nbsp; Admission will be a donation of non-perishable food.
   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The Pagan Pride Project 
  &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;is a global non-profit organization dedicated to the elimination of prejudice and religious discrimination through education, activism, charity and community. Pagan Pride Project global event attendance has broken records every year, with nearly 50,000 people attending Pagan Pride events in six countries. Pagan Pride attendees have donated thousand pounds of food and goods to local food banks, women's shelters, animal shelters and other charities. In addition to the material collections, Pagan Pride events also raised thousands of dollars in cash donations for local and regional charitable causes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
