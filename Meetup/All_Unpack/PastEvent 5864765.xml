This will act as the summer extension to the Japanese Lunch Table that already takes place at MIT during the academic year.  Anyway, we meet every Wednesday from 12:30 to 2:00 pm to enjoy casual language exchange.  Of course, all ages are welcome and feel free to bring your friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until we have a more permanent location established, we will meet up at the 1st floor Stata Center dining area.  Stata Center can be easily reached from the Kendall/MIT T stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check out this web page for 4 photos of Stata Center (trust me, this building is very easy to find):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/events/news/stata.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.csail.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have edited a small MIT campus map that can be found here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mit.edu/~rschuman/directions_from_kendall_to_stata.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mit.edu/~r...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple directions:&lt;br /&gt;From the Kendall/MIT T Stop, follow along Main Street past The Coop, The Kendall, Legal Sea Foods, and Ames Street.  Stata Center will be on your left on the corner of Vassar and Main Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you then!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181925155000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181227599000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Lunch Table</name><id>5864765</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181752200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/5864765/</event_url></item>
