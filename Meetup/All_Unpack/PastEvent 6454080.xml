Highlights include exploding paint over a whole housing estate for Sony, and a piece of computer-generated trickery that places Elvis Presley on the same stage as The Sugababes, and Marvin Gaye, Sheryl Crow, and Stevie Wonder describe the daily output of a BBC radio station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater during the credits. After the film, we'll head off to a local Noodle joint for dinner and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193610141000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191116755000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WORLD'S BEST TV ADS: BRITISH ADVERTISING FILMS OF 2007</name><id>6454080</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193436900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6454080/</event_url></item>
