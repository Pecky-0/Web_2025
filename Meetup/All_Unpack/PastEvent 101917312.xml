&lt;p&gt;Our February breakfast will be set up differently than our regular single speaker format. WBOA will be hosting a roundtable event, featuring our resident experts, who will be offering several short and informative sessions on topics important to small business owners. This meeting format will allow us to move about the room and interact with the speakers - a refreshing change of pace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Achieve Your 2013 Goals with Time Blocking and Doable Actions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Certified business coach Becky Castro, who lost 60+ lbs over the past year, will show you how to reach any goal for 2013 by using the skills of time blocking and doable actions to manage your time effectively!! &lt;br /&gt;

 Her favorite comic this time of year is this: Hobbes asks Calvin: "Are you making any resolutions for the new year?" And Calvin replies, "Yeah, I'm resolving to just wing it and see what happens." Do not wing it or be like 87% of the U.S. population who give up on their 2013 resolutions at the beginning of February!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becky Castro, CPCC, PCC&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.KeepItOffOnceAndForAll.com"&gt;www.KeepItOffOnceAndForAll.com&lt;/a&gt; Keep It Off Once and For all, is based on the 5 Secrets to permanent weight loss (available for free on her website). Becky asks, "What would it be like if you could choose to eat the foods you love, that give you pleasure and satisfaction; lose weight at the same time; go from "have to" to "want to" with your exercise; and be immersed in an engaged, active, community that supports you to be at your peak?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Kick Computer Strain out of your Body Now!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Experience how to relieve the physical problems caused by sitting at a computer. Learn effortless and pleasant methods to eliminate back pain, shoulder tension, and neck aches. This is not postural correction but instead is an approach that feels natural, and brings more ease and integrity to your body. This same approach also brings more ease to your public speaking and personal presentation, because it helps you feel calm in high stress situations and deepens your ability to rest and recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donna Brooks, Original Body Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Self-promotion Should Be Easy and Fun&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Not only can it be easier for you, it works much better if you find the easy natural way for you. And it doesn’t have to involve social media unless you want it to. Come learn a simple way to find your unique natural self-promotion path. (P.S., The same principle also works for resolving other business challenges.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Val Nelson, Career &amp;amp; Business Coach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Marketing Should Be FUN, Not Painful&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 It isn’t enough to know that you NEED to market yourself, your products and your services — it's HOW you do it all and keep yourself SANE. Have you ever kicked yourself after missed an opportunity just because you didn’t have your marketing hat on straight? Good marketing starts with an organized plan that is well thought out, manageable and lets you BREATHE. Say “Hello” to your new best friend – your marketing calendar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Quick Pick-Me-Up (Without the Caffeine)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Vivian will share some quick, fun, easy ways to give you that second wind (or even that first wind!) when you need to be more alert and flexible. Consider it the "Get set" and "ready" before "Action!"&lt;/p&gt;
