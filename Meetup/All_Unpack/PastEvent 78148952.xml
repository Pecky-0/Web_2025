<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's celebrate the Labor Day weekend, the unofficial end of summer - with a get-together on the deck and in the pool at Gloria and Mike's home in Windsor. Definitely a family event, so bring the kids along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start around 2:00, throw some food on the grill around 5:00, and party on the deck at least until dark, when we can always move inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring something to share for food and if you have a particular libation you would like, bring that along too. Don't forget suits and towels!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you know the history of planning pool parties at Gloria's, so we'll try for Saturday with a rain date of Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a private home, directions will be sent to those who RSVP. Also, you should know this home has a dog (and maybe even two by then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can add a comment about what you might be bringing food-wise, that will help with the planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346614816000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345210983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last blast of summer - pool party</name><id>78148952</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346522400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/78148952/</event_url></item>
