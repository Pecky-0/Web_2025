<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;It's time to wind down the year and get into the Christmas spirit with great friends, new people that will be great friends and chase away the blues.&amp;nbsp; Whatever holidays you celebrate bring it with you to share with whoever is here.&amp;nbsp;Wherever did 2011 go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's celebrate the season and reflect on good things that have come our way in 2011 and get ready for (gulp) 2012.&amp;nbsp; I am inviting all to share this holiday at my house.&amp;nbsp; The situation is the same as past wine tasting events...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wine night at my house... on a &lt;span&gt;Sat December 3, 2011&lt;/span&gt;! in Cheshire CT &lt;span&gt;6pm - 10 pm&lt;/span&gt; +&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvres or desert.&amp;nbsp; Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; This invitation will go out to 5 groups of 15 people ea.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Please bring your own glass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; I have some, but not enough for all even though I now have some extra Benmarl wine glasses now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group,&amp;nbsp;to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reds Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, &lt;span&gt;shiraz&lt;/span&gt; pinot noir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whites - &lt;br /&gt;

sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a person&amp;rsquo;s spot if you do not show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already&amp;nbsp;to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence.&amp;nbsp; It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly.&amp;nbsp; I will have water and coffee too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy, responsibly!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Knock on the door... ring the bell</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ralph</member_name><member_id>8774347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323028485000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
