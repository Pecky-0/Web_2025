This does NOT replace the regular meetup (Aug 11), but is in addition to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of you may know Amy and Alan as regular attendees at the sushi meetups, but they have not had Internet access and therefore have not been participating via e-mail and the web. (That's how I'm getting away with announcing a surprise party!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests should be expected to arrive by 7:30pm, while Amy is expected to arrive with Alan around 8:00pm. The entire tatami room (floor space) has been reserved for this event, so plan on removing your shoes and dining traditional Japanese style.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zigamorph</member_name><member_id>2030415</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1127220027000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ri</urlname><id>197204</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1122912344000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special event: Sushi SURPRISE Birthday Party</name><id>4742662</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1124407800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ri/events/4742662/</event_url></item>
