We'll be combing the basement floor for thrifty finds at $1.50 a pound.  That's right, you sift through the clothing heaps and find your treasures - all at only $1.50 per pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After-shop review and socializing (perhaps a mini-fashion show?) across the street at the Cambridge Brewery at 8:00 (&lt;a href="http://www.cambrew.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.cambrew.com&lt;/a&gt;).  What could you possibly have to do that's better than scooping articles of clothing off a basement floor by the pound?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So look no further if you're seeking like-minded progressives to hang out with in Boston, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while finding great bargains, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in.  Bonus points if you're psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?
