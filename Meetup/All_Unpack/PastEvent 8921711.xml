(aka the &amp;quot;Permibus&amp;quot;).  You may have seen the Permibus folk at the Common Ground Fair and they've had a chance to take in Maine for a few weeks now.  &lt;b&gt;This weekend they will be in Portland and would like to share some of their skills and experience with us!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Saturday and Sunday will be 9:30am to 12:30pm followed by sharing some &lt;b&gt;potluck&lt;/b&gt; food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is going to be happening in West Falmouth at Aaron Parker's place (about 15-20 minutes from downtown Portland).  The Bike Barn (on Aaron's dad's property) is technically at 547 Blackstrap but the bus will be parked in Aaron's driveway (the driveway *before* his father's house.  Aaron's driveway has a small sign on it that says &amp;quot;scott dugas.&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Park along Blackstrap&lt;/b&gt; but don't block the mailboxes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost&lt;/b&gt;:  Sliding scale donation of $5-25 per session; pay what you can.  No one will be turned away for lack of funds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see our Meetup Event RSVP Guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://permaculture.meetup.com/58/messages/boards/thread/5233158#20208623"&gt;http://permaculture.m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you would like to get on the waiting list for an open spot, RSVP &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; with a comment that you'd like to get in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your own potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)!
