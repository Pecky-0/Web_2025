&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="color : #ff0000"&gt;12/15 UPDATE: There is NO cover charge!  So far all the word is 1 special is a lobster bake for $20.13 I am sure there will be more....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will have more details as they are available, so remember to be watching your emails and come back to the event page for all the info. With the time set as it is that will give us time to relax, chat, grab dinner and wait for the band!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a table reserved a table for all of us, and I am sure they will have some awesome specials' so remember to check back to see, what I will be updating is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--If this year they will have a cover charge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--What the special items on the menu will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--What drink special's they will have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the date gets closer remember to check back so we are all on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This event will fill up fast, don't be left out of the fun, get that RSVP in. I have set the settings at only 1 guest per person because there is a limit to the amount of ppl that I could put in for the RSVP.  You will see that there is no minimum for ppl to come dancing, so it would be best to have your additional guest come at/after 7:30pm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please bring plenty of cash and smaller bills (one's and five's) and some coins to pay for your bill,  We will NOT be able to get separate checks.  Remember one dollar bills are your friends, lol. Hopefully the new way to pay your bill worked at breakfast so we can use it again at this event and we will continue to use this system.  Work with me here this will be the 2nd time we will be using it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seats are limited if you have RSVP'd for any past events and you were a no show, you may not be able to get into this event.  This is going to be a popular event and I want everyone to come along!  I understand that things happen, I get tha,t so when you know that you WILL BE joining us then put in your YES RSVP, and send me an email and let me know: msdondon2003@yahoo.com please don't take up a spot that someone else could have had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will be scheduling this on my 2 Meetup sites, so there may be more people going to this event then you see.  IF you are on both sites (Our Circle of Friends and Connections &amp;amp; Friends) then please only RSVP on 1 site.  If you end up putting in your yes on both sites be looking for an email from me, explaining which group I took you off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute now and put the Meetup phone into your phone, that way if you are are running late, can’t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, you already have it in your phone:  978-304-2811, please note this phone does not accept text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time for you to pay your dues?  Please look at your profile page where it states “Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer” You can pay your dues at any event.  Thank you in advance for paying your dues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow may cancel this event please remember to check back to see if we are still going to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a courtesy to everyone in the group come back to the event page and change your RSVP if your plans change or call me/send a message through the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to enjoy an awesome meal with you at Michael's!&lt;/p&gt;
