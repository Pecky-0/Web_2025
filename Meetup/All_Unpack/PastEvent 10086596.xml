I will have a couple ropes to set up.  If you need harness/shoes please let me know so I can bring them for you.  This is an urban climbing experience so some trash is around :(  But the rock is great and it is usually dry this time of year!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park near the tennis courts and come up to the big cliff and look for us</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239749336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238588444000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring has Sprung  Rock Rimmon Climb</name><id>10086596</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238943600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/10086596/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/6/global_6938422.jpeg</photo_url></item>
