It's a great opportunity to meet other Boston-area avid readers and to swap books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know what a yankee swap is, here are some typical rules: &lt;a href="http://mullenclan.com/misc/YankeeSwapRules.htm" class="linkified"&gt;http://mullenclan.com/misc/YankeeSwapRules.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions: Bring a single book, new or gently used, that you want to share/give to others, and wrap it up for the yankee swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert Bookcrossers: Outside of the yankee swap game, we are allowed to bring a few extra books to give away bookcrossing-style, but not as many (as a typical meeting), as you'll be responsible for books that you bring and give away. If any of your books are unclaimed at the end of the evening, you'll need to bring them home, as there will be no place to leave them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of limited space at the venue, I'm capping rsvps at 8; please only rsvp if you are coming. If we have extended interest, I'll check with the organizers to see if they can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;
