All breeds welcome so long as your dog likes to play with other dogs in a social environment. We have an indoor and outdoor playroom made specially for dog playdates. We provide water, toys, and clean up....as well as refreshments for both dogs and humans too! And this time we have a special appearance being made by the Best Friends Treat Truck! The Treat Truck is an interactive mobile that visits our centers and dog parks through out the nation. It is filled with goodies like cookies, ice cream, and pet freebies. So come join us for a FUN doggie play date on Saturday afternoon, we'd love to meet your pet. Please be sure your dog is current on Rabies, Distemper, and Bordetella vaccines because they will be around other dogs off leash. Please don't hesitate to call us with any questions you might have: 860-721-8080. Or just stop by to see the truck, it is in CT for a limited time only!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check in at the front desk...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Pet Care</member_name><member_id>3611375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336853458000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>All Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DogLovers</urlname><id>448060</id><group_lat>41.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Rocky Hill "All Breed" Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335197643000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Treat Truck is Coming!</name><id>61766592</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336842000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DogLovers/events/61766592/</event_url></item>
