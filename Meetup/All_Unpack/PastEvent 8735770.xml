If you don't know Jim, he was very active in the NH Ron Paul campaign, and is now running for state rep. Please help Jim out of you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we will be doing some campaigning for Dave Mincin, who is also running for one of the 8 state reps slots in Strafford District 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Todd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liberty Lovers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we are past the primaries, I’d like to do the first lit drop for my campaign in Barrington this Saturday.  The plan is that I’d be at the dump (transfer station) all day meeting voters face to face.  Volunteers could come in the morning to meet me there to get lit, then drive around dropping the lit into newspaper  boxes.  I’d then buy them lunch at one of the local places.  If you can’t make the morning shift, you could come meet us for lunch, then do the lit drop.  We could even throw in a quick sign wave around lunch time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only a few months to go, and 6 towns to hit, I’d love to get enough volunteers to totally cover Barrington.  If you can help, please contact me at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jimforsythe@metrocast.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;603-822-2588&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will provide you the details.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Forsythe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.jimforsythe.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;This message was sent by Jim Forsythe (jimforsythe@metrocast.net) from Ron Paul for President - HQNH.&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about Jim Forsythe, visit his/her member profile&lt;br /&gt;To unsubscribe, click here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup Support: support@meetup.com&lt;br /&gt;632 Broadway, New York, NY 10012 USA&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Forsythe campaign signs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Todd Puterbaugh</member_name><member_id>4083337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221483898000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221131071000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Barrington Transfer Station Campaigning and Lit Drop for Jim Forsythe</name><id>8735770</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221310800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/8735770/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
