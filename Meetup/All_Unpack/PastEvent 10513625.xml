Unless we restrict our notions of God to actions or activities clearly stated in scriptural sources we invariably become beset with qualifications about what it is we are trying to prove or disprove. And if we cannot define that which is claimed to be existent or nonexistent, then we must settle for more general descriptions such as &amp;quot;God is spirit,&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;God is Mind,&amp;quot; or  &amp;quot;God is The Good or Goodness itself.&amp;quot;  Perhaps these general descriptions may lead to fruitful discussion even if not to actual agreement.  With the singular requirement that you be respectful to opposing viewpoints, the full gamut of views ranging from atheist to fundamentalist are all welcome here!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy in the picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252710173000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243522848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>What or who is God?
