Playing deep cuts from the 1960s heyday of the Stax/Motown era as well as original songs you&amp;rsquo;d swear were classics, this band will get you dancing and wont stop until you can&amp;rsquo;t dance any more. And there&amp;rsquo;s more! Santa Claus, yes THE Santa Claus will be in the house, holding court and taking photos all night long. You&amp;rsquo;ll have that special holiday photo just in time to impress the folks with how wholesome you are. What is Santa Claus without presents? He&amp;rsquo;s an overweight dude in a red suit, hanging out in a nightclub asking you to sit on his lap. That problem is SOLVED with a gift swap! Simply bring a awesome wrapped gift ($15 limit, no gag gifts please) that you would love to receive and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get a gift from Santa in return. Show your fellow soul music lover how you feel about them with something cool. To keep you in the spirits The Lucky Dog Music Hall will have plenty of unique drink specials just for this night. Let&amp;rsquo;s recap: Holiday Party with Beg, Scream &amp;amp; Shout! playing soul music all night, Santa Claus photo-booth, holiday drinks and a gift swap. Friday December 23, 2011 The Lucky Dog Music Hall 89 Green Street Worcester MA 01604 doors at 8PM, music at 9PM $12.00 in advance or at the door ***Tickets are on sale now!****&lt;a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/212420" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.brownpapertickets.com/&lt;/span&gt;event/212420&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott </member_name><member_id>8308375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324756147000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322187894000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beg, Scream &amp; Shout....A night of Soul </name><id>42311542</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324688400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/42311542/</event_url></item>
