They play all their own original music and are highly recommended. I agree! after listening to a few selections on their website. Very nice : ) &lt;br /&gt;Tom has agreed to help organize the evening. THANKYOU! He will provide his cellphone # to  'yes' RSVPs.  &lt;br /&gt;So, come out, relax and enjoy some great live music! Guaranteed a good time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME: 8:30pm - midnight &lt;br /&gt;        (music begins @ 9pm) &lt;br /&gt;COST: no cover &lt;br /&gt;          (donations are accepted) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band's website: www.johncate.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBA: This event is being co-organized by our fellow member Tom.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202918453000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Original music!
