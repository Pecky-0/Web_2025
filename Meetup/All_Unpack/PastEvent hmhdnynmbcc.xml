We will be meeting in the Crafts Room diagonally across from the Lounge where we usually meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having an open forum but I will be talking about EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) and touch on Hypnotherapy as alternative techniques to help with FMS pain. Come with your suggestions, concerns, questions and comments.  We will be here to support each other and to help everyone achieve a new level of health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E-mail me at btzee6@gmail.com if you want to present any findings or interesting information at the meeting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new schedule for now has me coming to Reading every five weeks.  I have tried to change the automatic meetup schedule 3 times now and the second Tuesday of each month still comes up.  I am trying to change this permanently but just remember my new schedule and call me if you are confused until this is fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember DONATIONS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED TO COVER MY MEETUP COSTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Betsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone needs to schedule an appointment with me the week of September 14-19th  call me at 623-251-7547 in AZ or 617-943-2282 on my cell phone.
