<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll help out Foodshare with the National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive by packing and loading the food collected by the carriers that day.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, we cannot work at our usual location at West Hartford Town Hall due to construction.  The event will take place at the post office on Shield Street in West Hartford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of people are needed to arrive around noon and more at 2:00.  Plan to work until about 6:00.  We usually go out for pizza or Chinese food afterwards.  This is a rain or shine event, so dress to work and for the weather.  When you RSVP, please let us know if you can come at noon or if you will be arriving later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember that Gloria won't be there that day (her brother picked that date for his wedding, how dare he?) so if someone has a pop-up shade tent or other canopy, please consider bringing it.  Along with snack food and drinks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541153000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174071768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Letter Carriers Food Drive</name><id>5576091</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178985600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/5576091/</event_url></item>
