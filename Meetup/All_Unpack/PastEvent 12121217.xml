It's a very pretty small state-owned forest and some of the locals even decorate for Christmas! If you would like to get out of the house for a bit of fresh air, come and join me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailhead I plan to use is on Tamarack Lane in Vernon, but it can be a bit tricky to find, so let's meet at 2:30 at the 7-11 on Route 30 in Vernon. If you know where the trailhead is, meet us there at 2:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will be an easy 2-3 miles over rolling terrain. If it has rained or snowed recently, it may be wet or icy, so boots are recommended. Be sure to dress in layers, so as you warm up, you can shed as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that I will have that very large and very active puppy of mine along, so if you are not a dog fan, this may not be the hike for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this event is weather-dependent, so check back that day if you are not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other meetup groups have scheduled a Chinese buffet dinner in Manchester, just a couple of exits away, so I'll probably head there after the hike, if others want to join me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
