&lt;p&gt;I'm so excited to be the new organizer of this meetup group. I've been a social entrepreneur for many years and have also consulted for several non-profits. I have a passion for finding ways to have a positive impact in the world. I'm so looking forward to meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to invite you into my home for a casual gathering to meet each other and share our goals and challenges. What are the current pressing issues for you, your non-profit and non-profits in general? How can we work together more effectively? Are there some specific ways we can be allies with each other? What type of events and resources would you like to see offered in this group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ill be offering snacks and beverages. Hope you can join us!!&lt;/p&gt;
