The band &amp;quot;Die Schlauberger&amp;quot; - Americas #1 German festival band is going to perform there on Saturday and Sunday and are sure to get you on your feet dancing and singing. We saw them at last year's Octoberfest and they really know how to cheer a crowd. We had a great time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets to get inside of the festival area are $15 dollars. I will be waiting outside of the main entrance waving my German flag! I will also keep my phone on, so those who may want to arrive later can get a hold of us and find us in the tents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see many of you there for a fun filled day! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will me waving  a German flag in front of the main entrance!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256249478000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254092312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eins, zwei, g’suffa! - International Octoberfest in Newport!!</name><id>11481396</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255194000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/11481396/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
