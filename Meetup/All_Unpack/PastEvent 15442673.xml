<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>On a weekly basis I would like to hook up with female friends of Single Mingle for a couple of hours while we knit and crochet.  I have some experience with knitting and crochet and would be willing to lend some of my expertise to the other women of the group.  I do not intend to be an instructor. I have basic knitting and crochet knowledge and plan to assist the women who attend in making shawls.  I have simple patterns that anyone can master with persistence.  Also if there are other women with experience please feel free to join and share what you know about knitting and crocheting with the group.  The primary purpose of &amp;quot;Girls Hook Up&amp;quot; is to bond and support with one another as women.  Ideas on other things we can do on &amp;quot;Girls Hook Up&amp;quot; night are welcome. We are also looking for places where we can meet that are comfy, cozy, and inspiring.  Goodies and pastries that compliment tea and coffee are always welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292799728000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289752837000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Girls Hook Up(Knitting and Crochet Group)</name><id>15442673</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291939200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/15442673/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
