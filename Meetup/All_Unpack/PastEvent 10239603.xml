Presumably the members of this group have some slight knowledge of the difference, but it's okay if you don't -- let's find out together!  Bring a bottle of either Merlot or Pinot Noir, priced under $20 and your own tasting glass. We'll taste them against each other, with a variety of cheeses, bread, and fruit, and share our impressions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this event will take place outdoors in the yard of a private home. Address and directions will be sent to those who R.S.V.P. &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot;  The weather forecast is for a warm and sunny day with no rain; if it changes, we will postpone until the following Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we don't have 5 yes R.S.V.Ps by Sunday afternoon at 3, this event will be rescheduled.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Private home in Medford -- directions will be sent to participants</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241881534000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240367836000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Evening Do-It-Yourself Wine Tasting</name><id>10239603</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240783200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/10239603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/f/1/global_8127057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
