The hall is absolutely beautiful, and the acoustics are amazing.  I will always try to sit in the left-middle balcony section, since it affords a good view of the orchestra, and any pianist's hands should there be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program will be performed by the NEC Philharmonia orchestra, and will  be guest conducted by Christopher Wilkins.   For more details about him and the concert, go to &lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/christopher-wilkins-conducts-nec-philharmonia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/christopher-wilkins-conducts-nec-philharmonia" target="_blank"&gt;http://necmusic.edu/c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but let's meet up at 7:30, so we have a chance to socialize before the concert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Jordan Hall:&lt;br /&gt;The hall is located at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=jordan+Hall,+Boston+MA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=59.467068,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.342781,-71.085577&amp;amp;spn=0.006883,0.020599&amp;amp;z=17" target="_blank"&gt;the corner of Huntington and Gainsborough streets&lt;/a&gt;, about a block south of the Symphony T stop on the Green Line.
