Roos, located at 249 State St., North Haven, CT, their phone: (203) 281-5411.  This will be our special day after Christmas hangover bash...you don't wanna miss this one!  The Christmas hangover is not necessarily alcohol induced (though it can be a factor)...it's usually caused by a combination of too much holiday music and rude crowds in the malls, annoying in-laws and obnoxious relatives, not to mention ungrateful gift recipients...yeah the holidays can be stressful at times, but know what, by Saturday night it will be over, you survived the madness...and it's your time to come out, party down, and shake a tail feather too some good 'ol school R&amp;amp;B dance music with The Bernadettes!!!  If you're lucky, you might have actually received a bonus from work...the credit card bills won't arrive for a couple weeks...more the reason to come out and celebrate!  Our J. Roos shows are always very popular amongst all of our friends and fans...always a party when we play here...they serve up some pretty tasty pizzas, along with hearty portions of pub grub, add a nice spacious dance floor...you got the ingredients for rockin' post holiday bash!  Showtime kicks off at 9:30...we usually pack the place so reservations or an early arrival recommended.  We wanna see ya'll there!  For more info, visit J.
