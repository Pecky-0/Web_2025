Have no fear! Here is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're planning to BIKE the Blackstone River bike path this Sunday, the 25th of October, at 10:00 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a race! It will not be a fast ride! It will be a fun ride at a comfortable pace. No need to be nervous if you are not a fast bicyclist. It's a social ride. If you want to just do a portion of the ride, feel free. We will probably take a break at the other end of the path. There is an ice cream shop there, so you may want to bring a few dollars with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is raining, I will reschedule for another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blackstone River Bikeway is 10 miles of paved bike path from Lincoln through Valley Falls Heritage Park in Cumberland and ends in Woonsocket at the Water Treatment Plant on Manville Hill Road. We often stop at the end of the path for ice cream, before turning around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at The Blackstone River State Park, Front Street, Lincoln. To find us: pull into the address listed above, go down the road for maybe a mile and we'll be at the first parking lot on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to take my cell phone number: 508-414-8544 in case you can't find us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255792292000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254971231000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biking the Blackstone River Bike Path (Slow Pace)</name><id>11577790</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255269600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11577790/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/e/global_11114014.jpeg</photo_url></item>
