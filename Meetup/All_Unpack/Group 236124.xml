&lt;p&gt;We began as a group focused on Artist Trading Cards (ATCs), which are small (3.5- x 2.5-inch) works of original art. We're now an "ATCs+" group, meaning that our activities are open to people working on other art and craft projects, such as altered books, art journals, greeting cards, etc. (See "About Us" for much more detail.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group is open to adult artists and craftspeople at all experience levels. Our current members range from professional artists to near-newbies. We offer a variety of demos at our monthly Meetups in Natick and workshops and crafting space at ArtStudio 360 in Holliston. Everyone's welcome at either venue--we just ask that you RSVP to let us know you're attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group, which began in mid-2007, has quickly evolved into a lively, highly creative community. As one member puts it: "You feel like you're 'in the flow' from the moment you walk in the door." And yet it's not all about self-expression: Without exception, members have been extraordinarily generous about sharing ideas, techniques and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signing up for events in either Natick or Holliston is easy. Just&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;join this Meetup group (membership is free). Then RSVP "yes" for the events that interest you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: We take art seriously, but we have a LOT of fun. And we welcome newcomers. Join us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.92</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1146102874000</created><lat>42.2900009155</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1502</id><urlkey>art</urlkey><name>Art</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1524</id><urlkey>collage</urlkey><name>Collage</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1531</id><urlkey>artisttradingcards</urlkey><name>Artist Trading Cards</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1573</id><urlkey>rubberstamp</urlkey><name>Rubber Stamps</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2047</id><urlkey>alteredbooks</urlkey><name>Altered Books</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10228</id><urlkey>groupart</urlkey><name>Group Art</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17320</id><urlkey>paper-crafts</urlkey><name>Paper Crafts</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17760</id><urlkey>art-journaling</urlkey><name>Art Journaling</name></topics_item></topics><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name><id>236124</id><members>165</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>2718718</member_id><name>Anne</name></organizer><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/7/2/600_228147762.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/7/2/highres_228147762.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>228147762</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/7/2/thumb_228147762.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Natick</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/</link><lon>-71.3499984741</lon></item>
