<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the new Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate that will alternate in exposing our children to the Mandarin and Cantonese Languages.  It is co-hosted (experimentally for now) by MJ who is a native and fluent speaker in both Mandarin and Cantonese.  And I help provide the informal educational components in the form of a short group activity appropriate for all ages to promote the learning and use of the languages.  We strive to make Mandarin and Cantonese accessible to all levels!  So don't be shy!  We can all learn together with our kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week, we will have story-time in Cantonese.&lt;/strong&gt; And Lisa is our guest co-host!  We will start story-time and learn a song to sing  around 10:45am.  The activity this week will be &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yum Cha Dim Sum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; After hearing a story about Dim Sum, the kids will crafts some paper dim sum foods (super easy to cut and color).  Then they can play dim sum when we put the play food on a wagon.  I'll set up little &amp;amp; big tables on the living room for their dining pleasure!  Maybe a few stuffed animals and dolls might attend this meal. We will feature some Cantonese culture with some Cantonese music for ambience! &lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/48961800108910343402/img/smileys/laughing.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids can always free-play as desired.  If you have DVDs to share or information on links to videos in Chinese that are appropriate for babies and young toddlers to view, please bring them to share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breastfeeding-friendly environment!  Bring your baby's bottle/fomula or your tots lunch if you want to stay for lunch together. (And your own lunch too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also have some REAL dim sum foods from a restaurant in Quincy (Lisa will bring a few things that will travel well). And I will see if more dim sum food can be delivered from Ten-Ichi in Natick.  If you have a toy teapot and cups, feel free to bring them.  I only have one teapot and a few cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please just RSVP for yourself and your child.  Add "+1" etc if you are bringing more than one child.  I need a head-count of children so we have enough materials for all of them... even the babies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/files/"&gt;Please download and print the parking permit under 'FILES'&lt;/a&gt;.  You may park in my driveway until there's no space.  Then use the street as needed.  This should fill a regular 8.5 x 11 paper in landscape.  Place on dash.  Only works on my street! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Elsie's cell:  508-202-0097 (okay to txt me)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elsie Smits</member_name><member_id>17363801</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351288731000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350696151000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate</name><id>qnhkmcyqnbpc</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>14400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351261800000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/87763502/</event_url></item>
