We will want to head in for seats before 6:15.  Movie time is 6:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go out and have a few laughs by watching several funny comics cavorting about.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, since we see movies opening weekend, it is a very good idea to buy tickets ahead of time...especially if it is a big name movie.   I have run a few meetups this summer where some people came, but could not get into the show.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup badge.  Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me.   I generally get there about a half hour before the show and the group heads in for seats about 15 minutes before hand.  If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studio: Paramount Pictures &lt;br /&gt;Director: Jay Roach &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: David Guion, Michael Handelman, Francis Veber &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Jemaine Clement, Jeff Dunham, Bruce Greenwood, Ron Livingston, Stephanie Szostak, Lucy Davenport, Kristen Schaal &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Comedy &lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for sequences of crude and sexual content, some partial nudity and language) &lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dinnerforschmucks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dinnerfors...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: &amp;quot;Dinner for Schmucks&amp;quot; tells the story of Tim (Paul Rudd), a guy on the verge of having it all.
