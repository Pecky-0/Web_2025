Doing one weekly got to be too much for me alone to deal with and honestly only 4 or 5 people ever posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's give it another try! Starting today I will organize a monthly photo challenge. Each month on the last day of the month I will post the challenge in the calendar. I will create a folder in our photo gallery and we will use the message board for comments. The photo must be taken within that calendar month (what's the point if you are dipping into old pics!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This months challenge, 'SIGNS OF FALL' will be due on or before September 30. Please RSVP i fyou plan to participate. This will give me a good idea if people really are interested in a monthly photo challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone would like to volunteer to manage the monthly challenge I am happy to hand of responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, Eileen&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223717324000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221519995000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NEPN Photography Challenge: September: Signs of Fall</name><id>8764134</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222815600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8764134/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/3/global_5528595.jpeg</photo_url></item>
