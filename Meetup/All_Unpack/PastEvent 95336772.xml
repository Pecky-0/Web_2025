Here's our chance to do something about it! We'll start from the cafe, run around the common, down Riverwalk park along the river to prospect st., and back. Its a 2 mile run and we'll accommodate any paces, including tempo walkers, though we might spread out a bit. Coffee, ice cream, pastries, and good times await us at the cafe when we're done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a short distance but we'll increase it when the group is ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alexandra Sieving</member_name><member_id>50951822</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355767649000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Waltham-Trail-Runners</urlname><id>1479223</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Trail Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355493909000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Teen/youth run from Cafe on the Common 2 miles</name><id>95336772</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355583600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Waltham-Trail-Runners/events/95336772/</event_url></item>
