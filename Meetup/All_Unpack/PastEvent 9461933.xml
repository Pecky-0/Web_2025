Since it's just about halfway between Harvard Square and Central Square, the most&lt;br /&gt;convenient transportation is the #1 bus on Mass Ave. Or take the Red&lt;br /&gt;Line to either Harvard or Central and walk about 10 minutes. Parking is free on Sundays in both metered spaces and residential parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's topic: &lt;br /&gt;Have you ever heard people say things like &amp;quot;I won't eat cloned meat, it's too science-fictiony.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;This isn't like science fiction. It could really happen.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn't that just burn your biscuits? But you know, they're right. A lot of science fiction is scary and/or impossible. Why is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenge:&lt;br /&gt;Consider an example of a science fiction future you would or would not like to live in? Why? Does that affect how you enjoy the story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. What do you plan to write next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: Are we too science fictiony?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open discussion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237062156000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231281728000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers February Meetup</name><id>9461933</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234126800000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/9461933/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/e/global_146222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
