Enjoy the weekend in beautiful Franconia Notch while the wild flowers are in bloom.  Friday night through Sunday morning we will be camping at Lafayette Place.  Alex and I will arrive early to set up tents and equipment especially for those people who might be arriving late.   &lt;br /&gt;Saturday morning we will hike up to Mt. Liberty and then take the Franconia Ridge Trail to Mt. Flume.  These are both over 4000ft and require above tree line gear.  Bag two 4000+ ft.  summits in one day.  This is a level four hike for experienced hikers only due to elevation and mileage (8+ miles).  Plan to be on the trail a full day.  Sunday will be a more relaxing hike, leaders choice. &lt;br /&gt;So if you're up for a challenge and some smores, this is the weekend for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this hike is $25.00 per person to cover the campsite fees for both nights.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at campsite 9 in Lafayette Place Campground</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>alex</member_name><member_id>9062140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244758971000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243808093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Camp and Hike Mt.
