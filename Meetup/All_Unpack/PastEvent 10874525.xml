<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I know this is kinda last minute, but I heard this sunday is going to be a perfect day for a hike. So I couldn't resist. I've been dying to check out the Fells for awhile, so why not? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Middlesex Fells is only a short drive away from Boston, but it is full of beautiful landscape of rocky hills, meadows, wetlands, oak and hickory forests, quiet ponds, vernal pools, panoramic vistas.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Spot Pond offers sailing, kayak, canoe and rowboat rentals. So we can check that out too if people want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm pretty new at hiking, (but my boyfriend, Lucas is an experienced hiker) so I'd like to take it easy with this hiking, but more advance hikers are welcome too!&lt;br /&gt;I think for now we can shoot for 2~3 mile loop trail, but we can decide the trail when we meet up at the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring water, bug spray, snacks and nice sturdy shoes (hiking boots prefered, no flats ladies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fells.org/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fells.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/fells.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Sun or call (will send out my number to the RSVPs)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248479219000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247591845000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy hike at the Middlesex Fells</name><id>10874525</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248022800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/10874525/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/0/global_9668960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
