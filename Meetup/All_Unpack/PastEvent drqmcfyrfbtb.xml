&lt;p&gt;Join us at our regular place at a new time, 5:30pm.  We will share some wine and cheese and have access to one of the area's premier gurus on networking and relationship marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting noticed and winning business in today's noisy and crowded marketplace is more challenging than ever before, and thanks to a giant megaphone we call "social media", word of mouth is more powerful than ever before. "Leaky bucket" marketing, the never ending pursuit of new customers is not only tragically inefficient but it is also without joy. Instead, let's contemplate "relationship based marketing". Let's focus on leveraging existing relationships with people who already know us, like us and trust us. Retention over acquisition. And by creating a superior customer experience we will harness the awesome power of positive word of mouth. &lt;br /&gt;

 Jim Kohn started working in restaurants as a teenager, had a successful career turning around failing restaurants, and by the time he was 40 he no longer had to go to work. Always the entrepreneur, for almost 20 years now Jim has focused on helping other business people meet their goals and compete successfully in an increasingly crowded and noisy marketplace. Jim's approach to success emphasizes creating a superior customer experience through extraordinary customer service and stronger, more genuine relationships. Jim rejects traditional "leaky bucket" marketing, instead advocating customer retention over new customer acquisition as a more efficient and fulfilling business strategy. A good day for Jim is when the sharing of his wisdom changes someone's life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa </member_name><member_id>9510638</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cheryl Roby</member_name><member_id>10682494</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne Garland</member_name><member_id>11311382</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patti Urban</member_name><member_id>12821348</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carin Roaldset</member_name><member_id>14028876</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363343397000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Association-of-Women-Business-leaders</urlname><id>1543671</id><group_lat>41.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>AWBL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357308487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>After work Networking and Jim Kohn on Relationship Based Marketing</name><id>drqmcfyrfbtb</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363296600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Association-of-Women-Business-leaders/events/101411622/</event_url></item>
