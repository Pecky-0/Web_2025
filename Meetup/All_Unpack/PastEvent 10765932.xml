Those of your who love to climb rocks, this is your day.  The rocks are an amazing three story jumble of climbing fun.   This hike will be a 4 mile thru hike.  Time on the trail should be no more than 3 hours.  This means we will meet at the end point and a couple of folks will drive everyone to the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a technical hike.  It is an easier event than my usual.  There is a good view and cool rocks.  The trail is doable for many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin on Pine Mountain Rd.  This dirt road off of Rt. 179 goes into Tunxis State Forest and we will walk it for about 1.5 miles.  We will then head south on the blue blaze Tunxis Trail.  This will take us over Pine Mountain at a blistering 1391' elevation (from sea level).  The trail is rugged but interesting.  Our goal is the council caves from here.  This is an area of huge glacier boulders with cave-like pockets.  Many native american artifacts have been found here but it is not known if the area was used for council meetings.  From there we will successfully stumble out of the woods onto Rt. 179 and the cars.  Hopefully those of us who drove can get rides back to the start :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting at the parking area across from Legeyt Rd. on Rt. 179.  Parking at this spot is limited.  Make sure you have water and snacks and bug spray.  Since we are shuttling people please be on time.  We will leave the parking area by 11:15 to be on the trail for 11:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should be done by 2:30.  If folks want to linger with your left over 4th picnic food, we can do that.  Barkhamsted Dam is right down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Barkhamsted&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=1+Legeyt+Rd#a/maps/m::10:41.943677:-72.914118:0:::::/e" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
