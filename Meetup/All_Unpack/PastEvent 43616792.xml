This year, we will be gathering at The Brahmin in Boston's Back Bay, for cocktails, passed appetizers, a full menu available in the kitchen, and good company. For those of you with a gustatory imagination, we can confirm that the passed apps will include vegetable crudites; fresh cherry tomato; bacon-wrapped scallops; Italian meatballs; and three kinds of flatbread. Full bar service will of course be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to attend this event will be $25.00 collected at the door or via PayPal in advance to one of the event organizers, Julie Arnold or Zachary Bos. This price includes both a sparkling cider toast and a pouring of champagne, and a donation to Rosie's Place, a local women's shelter. Due to the nature of the event, please keep your RSVP updated so that we can get an accurate number of expected attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for an evening of friends, food, and celebration, and do feel free to bring whatever guests you wish. Ours is an inclusive community -- friends and family, of whatever epistemological persuasion, are welcome to join us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324326141000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323206889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2011 Winter Solstice Party</name><id>43616792</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324245600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/43616792/</event_url></item>
