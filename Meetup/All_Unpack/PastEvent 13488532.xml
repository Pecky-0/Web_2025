Many of you said that you liked the idea, and Margo Lynn has agreed to host the event!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seating is open, but you can buy tickets in advance on the website below.  Tickets are also available at the door.  Please note: ***&lt;b&gt;Margo Lynn will be saving a row of good seats, so reservations for this event will close at 12 P.M. on the day of the show May 22nd, so she will know how many to save.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;General admission is $18.00 ($16.00 for students and seniors). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margo Lynn knows this director's work and speaks highly of it.  Sounds fun!  (I wish I could go, but I have another commitment that night.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the information and website to get tix... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Man Who Came to Dinner&lt;/i&gt;, by George S.

Invited to your home for dinner, he slips on the icy stairway and is unable to leave as he rehabilitates for an excruciatingly long time.  He takes over your home, commandeers the telephone, all the while a host of crazy friends and staff come and go! Add an Egyptian sarcophagus, an octopus, some penguins and you have not the plot of the latest reality television show, but &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Came To Dinner&lt;/i&gt;.
