The Walk Against Hunger begins and ends at The Hartford Insurance Group on Asylum Avenue in Hartford, where there is plenty of free parking.  From The Hartford, walkers enjoy a three-mile loop through Hartford's historic west end, which returns the walkers right to the starting point.  Walk registration begins and 1:00 and the walk will step off promptly at 2:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fundraising walk, with a goal of raising $430,000!  Last year, 3,000 walkers raised just over $400,000.  Let's help them do even better this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit www.foodshare.org and click on the Walk Against Hunger logo to get all the details.  You can join our team -- Gloria's Glorious Gang -- or if you are unable to walk, you can make a donation to support Gloria or DJ or another member of the team.  If you are able to Walk, the web site will provide you with everything you need, including the ability to e-mail friends and family and ask for their support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541124000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173563042000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk Against Hunger</name><id>5556710</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178470800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/5556710/</event_url></item>
