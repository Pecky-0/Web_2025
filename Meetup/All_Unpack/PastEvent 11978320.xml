(and for continuing member this is your chance to review.) Continuing members come at 7:15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of you have suffered stress and anxiety to some degree at some point, so you know how it feels. Our previous meetup events were focused on learning how anxiety is a result of energetic misalignment along four energy gates and is caused by trauma.  So, as you already know, most of the unexplainable symptoms of stress and anxiety that you have are a result of some unhealed past events. I have offered a series of meetups where you've learned how to bring yourself back in the state of alignment and out of state of anxiety and fear.  In the next series of meetups you will learn how to actually heal your past wounding lastingly and with a sense of ease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holiday family gatherings present additional challenges and raise our levels of stress, as we deal with the pain and hurts of dysfunctional relationships both past and present. Held in our bodies it is like a poison that eats us from inside. In preparation for the holidays, many are urgently looking for ways to fix themselves up. This is the time when we can use all the help we can get. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been given plenty of well-meaning advice on how to deal with these challenges – &lt;br /&gt;“Be in charge of your happiness” &lt;br /&gt;“Make peace with your past and forgive everyone for everything”&lt;br /&gt;“Just do it!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great advice, one that is easier said than done, right?  I recently met a remarkable person – a Catholic priest who left the church because he felt the advice that they were giving to people on trauma and forgiveness was not really helping many of them heal.  He then dedicated his life to developing tools that truly worked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like him, over the last 25 years on my journey as a healer, I’ve been looking for tools that offer graceful and lasting healing so that we could live in our bodies with trust in the wisdom and support of the universe. The “Healing Without Effort” system is a result of this journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;If you are looking for a way to heal your pain, that anyone can easily master and benefit from …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want to find a simple way that would reduce your stress levels and make you feel happier and more like yourself again …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: tomato"&gt;Then, I want to invite you to join us for this pre-holiday meetup and give a gift to yourself!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn the most effective (but little known or understood) self-help technique to stop being consumed, drained and hurt by the painful past. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt; Simply identify a situation that you cannot forget or forgive (even if directed towards yourself) and join us on Wednesday, Dec. 9 to get your power back over your life. Do it for you, not for others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When healing is based on universal principles – it is virtually effortless.  The “Healing Without Effort” system is an amazing tool in everyday life, and it will work to heal small stresses, as well as cases of acute and chronic trauma.  Based on universal principles of energy ownership, it is a precious holiday gift from the universe to you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come, to heal with us and see what universe has in store for you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yuliya Cohen</member_name><member_id>6311859</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261897931000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259554495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>How to Beat Stress &amp; Anxiety and Heal Your Past </name><id>11978320</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260403200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma/events/11978320/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/e/b/global_11524075.jpeg</photo_url></item>
