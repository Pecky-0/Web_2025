The main attraction will be a talk by renowned author Daniel Dennett at Framingham State College, starting at 7 p.m. at the Dwight Performing Arts Center at the college.  Admission is $5, to be paid at the door.   We are not sure of the audience capacity, so you might want to arrive early.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All GWH and GBH members are welcome, and it's likely that we will find a place to have a drink and socialize afterwards.  This is an informal get-together, but might be a good chance to meet and get to know some other Bay State humanists.  If you're not doing anything else on the night of Darwin's bicentennial, please join us.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;GBH and GWH are both chapters of the American Humanist Association  www.americanhumanist.org.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266692629000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230906442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Join Boston and Worcester Humanists for Daniel Dennett lecture</name><id>9425235</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234483200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/9425235/</event_url></item>
