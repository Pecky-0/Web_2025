We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time. There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group).The hiking Meetup group,(Fellowship of the Tortoise)does easier,slower paced hikes than this group. Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals. This is a dog free hiking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trailhead: Take I93 north to exit 25, make right onto Holderness Rd (NH175A), make right onto Fieldhouse Rd. (Plymouth State University). We will meet here and drive the backroads to the trailhead together (Warren St., Texas Hill Rd., trailhead on Old Hebron Road right off the intersection of Texas Hill Road).&amp;nbsp; We will hike the Fauver and Sutherland Trails to the summit of Plymouth Mountain (2193').&amp;nbsp; Good views from rocky knobs and cliffs. 4.8 miles round trip, 1,400' feet elevation gain, AMC booktime 3.5 hours, 5 hours estimated time for our group. ---Steve ----&lt;/p&gt;
