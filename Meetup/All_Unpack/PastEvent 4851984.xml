One central task we think is worth looking into is putting together some kind of standard presentation that we can &amp;quot;take on the road&amp;quot;. Also, Dave is interested in trying to arrange a showing of some educational DVD, perhaps The End of Suburbia, on a big screen at USM. We set April 14 (our usual Meetup night) as the target date for that viewing. In the March meeting, then, we will see where we are on at on that, probably make plans for its publicity, and begin fleshing out ideas for a &amp;quot;standard presentation&amp;quot; on Peak Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also set ourselves a goal to try to do at least one thing about Peak Oil this month, and report on it in March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start the discussion at 6:30 in the O'Natural's meeting room, and go until 8:30 (or they throw us out). Anyone who wishes to eat there first, let's meet at 6 in the dining area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Advocates for Oil Awareness</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-169</urlname><id>113465</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1139618264000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness March Meetup</name><id>4851984</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1142033400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-169/events/4851984/</event_url></item>
