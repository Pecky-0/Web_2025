&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This hike is on the Memorial Day Weekend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The parking fee per car is $3 payable at a kiosk in the parking  lot near the trailhead.  You can pay with cash as the payment goes into an envelope that goes into a metal locked container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the one relatively steep bare rock slab going up Welch and the elevation gain this hike is not for a beginning hiker who doesn't get some sort of regular exercise, therefore the question I added when you RSVP. &lt;strong&gt;This hike is not for you if you have been a total couch potato lately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting There&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From I-93, take Exit 28 and head east toward Waterville Valley on NH 49 (for 93N take a right at end of ramp). In 5.6 miles turn left onto Upper Mad River Road. In 0.6 mile turn right onto Orris Road, following the hiking sign for the Welch-Dickey Loop Trail. In another 0.6 mile turn right onto a gravel road to the parking area for the Welch-Dickey Loop Trail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a loop hike across the summits of Welch and Dickey Mountains, providing many views along the way as the trail winds its away across open ledges. "&lt;span&gt;Good views for a relatively low amount of effort."  &lt;strong&gt;Still this is not a hike for just any beginner hiker if they don't get some sort of regular exercise (this hike is not for couch potatoes).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevation gain 1650 feet (cumulative) another site said the elevation gain was 1800 feet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These mountains are not high: Welch tops out at 2,605 feet and Dickey is slightly higher at 2,734 feet, still the total elevation gain for the first 2.5 miles of the hike is 1,650 feet..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The single-most “suggested” family hike in the White Mountains. Welch and Dickey summits command excellent views. The hike is substantial enough to give you a feeling of accomplishment, yet manageable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some places where there are drop offs and cliffs where you might want to keep you dog close to you if they are not cliff smart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitely bring some water for both you and your dog(s) and snacks/food (lunch?) for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have posted some photos as a preview of the hike in a previous hike's photo album which also now has some photos of the hike as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the chance of rain is to high during the day and time of the hike it will be cancelled and rescheduled as to much bare wet rock would be dangerous in terms of potential falls and injury.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
