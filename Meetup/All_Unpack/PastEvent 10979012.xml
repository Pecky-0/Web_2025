We will beat the heat by getting out early, and spending not more than 2 hours in the woods, walking and talking with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Chatfield Hollow, which is a state park located in Killingworth, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN: We will follow the Lookout trail, for under 2 miles of hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the outer parking area at 8:55 and begin hiking at 9:05. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: One or two bottles of &lt;b&gt;water&lt;/b&gt;!, and a snack if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  appropriate hot-weather clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: From I-95: take Exit 63, and follow Route 81 north to Route 80 west. Drive about 1.2 miles west on Route 80 and look for park entrance on your right (it comes up quick). &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;client=dell-usuk&amp;amp;channel=us&amp;amp;tab=wl&amp;amp;q=" target="_blank"&gt;Google map / Directions to park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: The DEP charges a fee to drive in to the park, but if we get there early enough, we should all be able to park in the outer parking area (visible from the road), and walk in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325182" target="_blank"&gt;Chatfield Hollow State Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRAIL MAPS should be available at the entrance, or you can print one out from the park website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the outer parking lot (free parking)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252258218000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248811677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Early-bird Hiking Chatfield Hollow Meetup</name><id>10979012</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250341200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/10979012/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/3/global_9954515.jpeg</photo_url></item>
