&lt;p&gt;The next book we will be reading is "Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Shrinking of the World Economy” by Joseph Stiglitz We will meet on Saturday, January 19, 3 p.m. until 5 p.m. at USNH, 700 Hartford Turnpike in Hamden. Lots of copies are available in Connecticut public libraries as well as in book stores and online. An unabridged audio book is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have some understanding of our country’s economic problems and issues, I think this is the book to read. Joe Stiglitz writes clearly and explains things in a way that requires no economics background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a Nobel Prize winner, member of the cabinet under former President Bill Clinton and chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Joseph E. Stiglitz has some practical ideas on how to ease the pain of the Great Recession and maybe help prevent the next one.” (Carl Hartman - Associated Press )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freefall is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the roots of the financial crisis. Stiglitz brilliantly analyzes the economic reasons behind the banking collapse, but he goes much further, digging down to the wrongheaded national faith in the power of free markets to regulate themselves and provide wealth for all.” (Chuck Leddy - Boston Globe )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Stiglitz uses his experience teaching to give the lay reader a lucid account of how overleveraged banks, a shoddy mortgage industry, predatory lending and unregulated trading contributed to the meltdown, and how, in his opinion, ill-conceived rescue efforts may have halted the freefall but have failed to grapple with more fundamental problems…. His prescience lends credibility to his trenchant analysis of the causes of the fiscal meltdown.” (Michiko Kakutani - The New York Times )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[W]hat brings this book to life is his formidable grasp of economic policy and strong sense of conviction about the blunders that have been made, especially with respect to the bank bailouts.” (Jim Zarroli, NPR business reporter - NPR )&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sholem</member_name><member_id>445389</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358633434000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356382221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book Discussion: "Freefall" by Joseph Stiglitz</name><id>96435622</id><duration>7200000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358625600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/96435622/</event_url></item>
