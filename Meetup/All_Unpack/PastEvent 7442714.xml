Below is Chris' original event description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;I'll be at Richter's at College and Chapel Streets at 10:15-10:30 for some pre-movie drinks; perhaps a half-yard.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright now I get to do what I love best.  Put up some quotes from this comic gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: But he was your second husband. Your first husband also disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;Mrs. White: But that was his job. He was an illusionist. &lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: But he never reappeared. &lt;br /&gt;Mrs. White: He wasn't a very good illusionist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: Professor Plum, you were once a professor of psychiatry specializing in helping paranoid and homicidal lunatics suffering from delusions of grandeur. &lt;br /&gt;Professor Plum: Yes, but now I work for the United Nations. &lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: So your work has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Plum: What are you afraid of, a fate worse than death? &lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Peacock: No, just death, isn't that enough? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Green: So it was you. I was going to expose you. &lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: I know. So I choose to expose myself. &lt;br /&gt;Colonel Mustard: Please, there are ladies present! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: At the start of the evening, I was in the hall. I know because I was there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: Three murders? &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Green: Six altogether. &lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: This is getting serious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Peacock: Uh, is there a little girl's room in the hall? &lt;br /&gt;Yvette: Oui oui, Madame. &lt;br /&gt;[points] &lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Peacock: No, I just have to powder my nose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husbands should be like Klenex--soft, strong, and disposable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: &lt;br /&gt;Don't deny it.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. White: &lt;br /&gt;What do you mean, &amp;quot;don't deny it&amp;quot;? I'm not denying anything.&lt;br /&gt;Wadsworth: &lt;br /&gt;Another denial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;Eric's contact number is: 860-214-9361. We'll be taking our seats at about 11:20p, so if you're late, just come on in!
