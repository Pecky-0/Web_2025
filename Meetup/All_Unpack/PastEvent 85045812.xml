<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Each year at Rotary UN Day, more than 1300 Rotarians including many Rotaractors and guests come together at UN Headquarters in New York. The program is designed to inspire and educate all participants as well as provide insight into the relationship between Rotary and the United Nations. &lt;br /&gt;

In the past, Boston Rotaract has been participating and the day has been very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will organize transport and accommodations when closer to the date. Fee is $25 for Rotaractors (includes full day events+ lunch) and sales end October 19th. It is highly recommended to register asap as tickets number is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
