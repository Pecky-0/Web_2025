Pranayama is a sanskrit word that means control (yama) of the life force (prana). It is also commonly describes various yogic breathing exercises that help give the practitioner control of the life force, or pranayama. After clearing our minds and relaxing our bodies we will introduce ourselves and decide on upcoming meeting topics and decide on a final meeting time if Friday evenings is not convenient. Future meeting topics can include exploring specific postures to emphasize a specific body part (for example the wrists or spine), breathing, a mood (like Candlelight yoga), piano yoga (yoga to live piano), etc. EVERYONE is encouraged to contribute. We hope to see you there. Our first few meetings will be at Farmington Valley Physical Therapy until the weather gets nicer, then we can move outside. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174922990000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173825228000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Central CT Yoga Meetup</name><id>5566614</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174687200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/5566614/</event_url></item>
