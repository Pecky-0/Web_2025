It is a lovely cafe with great food, beer, wine, coffee and desserts.  In addition, the Funky Monkey has wonderful live music.  I am very excited and proud to announce that on October 2, my step-brother is going to be the headline performer!  &lt;b&gt;Bob Raymond&lt;/b&gt; is a local singer/songwriter who has been performing in CT for many years, but this is his Funky Monkey DEBUT!  Bob is also vey generous and has donated his time at both of the fundraisers I helped to organize in support of a Haitian orphanage.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you will have a great evening.  Come spend some time relaxing with friends and sampling some tasty treats while you listen to the wonderful music of Bob Raymond.  If you have been to the Funky Monkey before, I am sure you don't need much persuasion to come again...and if you haven't, then you are about to make a great discovery! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a $5.00 cover charge at the door.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefunkymonkeycafe.com/The_Funky_Monkey_Cafe_%26_Gallery/Welcome.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thefunkymo...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelly S</member_name><member_id>2538500</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286116585000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Arts  lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Arts-Cultural-Events</urlname><id>1343414</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Arts &amp; Creative Cultural Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284782341000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cure your Funky Monkey Withdrawal with a fix of Bob Raymond!</name><id>14810347</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286060400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Arts-Cultural-Events/events/14810347/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/9/global_18024873.jpeg</photo_url></item>
