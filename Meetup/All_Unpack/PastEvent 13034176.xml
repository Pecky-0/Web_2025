<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Cathy suggested the trail next to the Manchester ice arena, and a bunch of other folks support it, so I'm  going to move my walk to that locale for the 7th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at 7pm at the ice arena at parks and rec on Electric st. Manchester. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably start on leash for a bit and see how the dogs are doing, then maybe take 'em off on the way back if they're good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you then!&lt;br /&gt;-Al&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Directions.&lt;br /&gt;Take exit 6, bearing to the right (if from the North) or left(if from the South) once you exit the highway. This will take you to a rotary. Stay on the rotary passing through one set of lights. After this set of lights, stay in the middle of the rotary and continue until a second set of lights. At this set of lights, you will continue straight through them which will bring you off the rotary. Take a left onto Montgomery street, then a right onto Bremer St. Take Bremer @ 1 mile then a left onto Electric Street. Ice Arena will be right ahead of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=electric+st+manchester+nh&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Electric+St,+Manchester,+NH+03102&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ei=mz26S9bbJcH38Aazs6zfBw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;amp;ct=image&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ8gEwAA" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271813277000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269925847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Ice arena bike trail walk.</name><id>13034176</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270681200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/13034176/</event_url></item>
