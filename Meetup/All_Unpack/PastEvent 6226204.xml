Bollywood comes from Bombay+Hollywood. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood" target="_blank"&gt;More here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is &amp;quot;Chak De! India&amp;quot; and the show-time is 3pm on Sunday, August 26 at the Capitol Theater in Arlington. I don't think we've had a meetup at the Capitol theater either (Tom, please correct me if I'm wrong), so that's another first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is about a disgraced coach who leads the Indian women's field hockey team to glory, and is based on a true story. It has got both good reviews and word-of-mouth (in the US and India) and has done well in India. It is not a typical candy-floss movie, though those who expect a Kurosawa movie will probably be disappointed. It also features Bollywood's biggest heart-throb and popular actor &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahrukh_Khan" target="_blank"&gt;Shahrukh Khan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one reviewer:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Chak De! India is the basic, every-single-sports-movie story of a disgraced player, here called Kabir Khan, pulling together a team of misfits to do the impossible -- here winning the World Championship. This is also a return to glory for Shah Rukh Khan, the superstar doing excellently as he tackles a cast with (almost) entirely deplorable acting chops and makes you believe. Director Shimit Amin shoves a hockey stick into the actor's hand, and -- fitter than he's looked in years -- Khan flies across cinematic AstroTurf, and shines.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/aug/10chak.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Rest of the review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA. &lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/movies/11chak.html" target="_blank"&gt;Another review&lt;/a&gt; from NYT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes.&lt;br /&gt;1. The company website that organizes Bollywood movies has the movie scheduled for Sunday, but when I called Capitol Theater to confirm, they didn't have that information in their system and wouldn't know for sure till tomorrow. So, I will confirm (or cancel) the meetup event here latest by Friday. *****CONFIRMED! The movie meetup is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Since this is the first time I'm watching a movie at Capitol theater, please call the theater at 781-648-6022 or check &lt;a href="http://feitheatres.com/capitol/theatre/directions.php" target="_blank"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; for parking information and how to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Based on past experience, there's a good possibility that for this particular movie, the theater will accept CASH ONLY for tickets. Please come prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. If you know of any decent not-expensive restaurants near the theater (that can seat ~15-20 people) and if you can recommend a few, please drop me a note as I'm unfamiliar with what's in the Arlington area near the Capitol theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amit will be holding a meetup sign near the hall exit (NOT outside the building) after the movie is over and we'll proceed to a nearby restaurant for food, conversation and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188328064000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187813517000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>And now for something completely different</name><id>6226204</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188154800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6226204/</event_url></item>
