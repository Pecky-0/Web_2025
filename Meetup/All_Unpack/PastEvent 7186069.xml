For over a century diners throughout the city of Boston have been welcomed into Amrheins to enjoy quality meals amongst friends and neighbors.  Today that tradition continues in our updated facility. Despite the renovations in 2005, Amrheins is still full of history. Amrheins is the proud home of the oldest hand carved bar in America and still has the first Draft Beer pump in Boston on display.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brunch buffet offers a carving station, omelet station, traditional breakfast items, dessert table and coffee/tea. It is one price at $15.95. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is located at Broadway and A Street in South Boston, steps from the Broadway stop on the Red Line or there is ample parking.
