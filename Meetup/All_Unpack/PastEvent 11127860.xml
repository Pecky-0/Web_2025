Accordingly, five different groups will be meeting in five restaurants for five discussions. Hopefully, this will counter the problem we often encounter -- that our enormous groups split up into several exclusive conversations, leading to a feeling of exclusion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proposed topic of conversation: &amp;quot;Atheism and Planetary Stewardship&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live limited lives on a planet of limited resources. Do Atheists, as person who strive to be rational and informed, have any special prerogative or advantage in dealing with questions of population control, ecology and conservation, life extension, and other issues that pertain to our use of the resources in our environment? Atheism doesn't imply any particular political or ethical position, but it does mean we are free from the influence of such external doctrines as Christian dominionism (&amp;quot;God gave us the world to use as we choose, as masters of the land&amp;quot;). So, what data is relevant? Is it ethical to have lots of babies, or fewer? Should we conserve resources, or extract and use them up willy-nilly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to member Jennifer M. for suggesting this topic.
