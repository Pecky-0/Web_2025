It's true what they say....just like many people who live in New York have never been to the Statue of Liberty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll meet at 10am&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the Minuteman Statue located at the Lexington Green.  We'll bike to Concord, maybe visit an old historic cemetery along the way, bike along the route the British marched to Concord (Battle Road - good for Hybrid Bikes) etc etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have a nice lunch in Concord Center...maybe grab some ice cream, visit the old North Bridge if people are into it....or just ride around on some beautiful roads in Concord before we make our trip back to Lexington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a bike in good working order (I definitely recommend a tune up if in question), bring plenty of water and energy food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ride length will probably be in the 30 mile range and the speed will average 12 mph.&lt;br /&gt;Helmets required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please change your RSVP to Yes or No by Saturday 12 noon so I know how many are coming...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Fox, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My cell on the day of the ride 617-894-8454</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rob Fox</member_name><member_id>4368625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219759992000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219359421000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Historic Bike Ride in Lexington Sunday</name><id>8594328</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219586400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/8594328/</event_url></item>
