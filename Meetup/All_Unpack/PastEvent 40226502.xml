Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group,&amp;nbsp;to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste. &amp;nbsp; Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing... Reds Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, &lt;span&gt;shiraz&lt;/span&gt; pinot noir, whites -  &lt;br /&gt;

sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc &amp;nbsp; Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a person&amp;rsquo;s spot if you do not show up. &amp;nbsp; *Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already&amp;nbsp;to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence.&amp;nbsp; It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly.&amp;nbsp; I will have water and coffee too. &amp;nbsp; Enjoy, responsibly! &amp;nbsp;</description><how_to_find_us>Will send out address a few days before :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise Brown</member_name><member_id>10321540</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323041520000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Winos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup</urlname><id>593834</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven  Wine and Dining  Meetup Group,</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320639368000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas Wine tasting at Ralph's house</name><id>40226502</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322953200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup/events/40226502/</event_url></item>
