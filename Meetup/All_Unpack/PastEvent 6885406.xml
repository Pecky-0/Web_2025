There are about 25 signed up so far (not all are registered with Meetup)..  I am extending this invitation to Meetup groups that speak German, French and Spanish.  My hope is that we will speak our languages simultaneously, but without English! If you know language speakers outside the Meetup groups, please invite them. This would be a multi-language, multi-cultural celebration with food, music and everyone trying their best not to speak Englisch!&lt;br /&gt;It will be in a private home in West Hartford not far from Panera Bread on Sunday Dec. 30 from 4-7PM.&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so that I can figure out how many people from the different groups are coming.&lt;br /&gt;Offerings for the table are welcome, but please keep them vegetarian (no meat or fish). Thanks und bis dann.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199221533000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Deutsch speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-425</urlname><id>438488</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197248848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Languages party &amp; pre-Silvester celebration</name><id>6885406</id><headcount>43</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199048400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-425/events/6885406/</event_url></item>
