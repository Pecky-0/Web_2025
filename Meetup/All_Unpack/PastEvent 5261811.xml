Looks like the Meetup Auto-Scheduler had us meeting on Thanksgiving Day.  That's not going to work, so we're rescheduling for Thursday, December 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had an excellent meeting last month, and are all looking forward to continuing the momentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the discussion at our first meeting, we'll be focusing on sharing NLP techniques with each other, coaching each other on ways to most effectively apply NLP, and actually using NLP with each other to generate change. Both newcomers and experts are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, we've done Core Tranformation and Visual Swish with people during the Meetups; it will be interesting to see just how effective those techniques were when we get back together.  If you have an issue you'd like worked on, or have a technique you'd like to try out, bring it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that we'll be having dinner at Union Street Restaurant (if you'd like), and that Meetup.com charges us a small fee for using their services, which will average out to about $4 per person per meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing _you_ there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540719000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163346543000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greater Boston NLP meetup - November/December</name><id>5261811</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165536000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/5261811/</event_url></item>
