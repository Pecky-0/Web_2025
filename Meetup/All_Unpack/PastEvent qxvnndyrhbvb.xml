&lt;strong&gt;Brown Bag Bingo Slideshow&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

This month we'll see what you creative types came up with for your Brown Bag Bingo challenge. If you're participating, be sure you &lt;span style="color : #ffcc00"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upload ALL of your images by noon on Wednesday May 15th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Monthly Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Our challenge for this month's meeting is &lt;strong&gt;Your Best&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Your Favorite&lt;/strong&gt;. Between now and the meeting, upload your favorite photo (that you took yourself) and what you consider to be your best photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be shy, we have a very encouraging group of critics and we'll all learn something from the experience. Most of all, &lt;strong&gt;have fun shooting&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Location: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the recent fire in the building, we've been asked to meet elsewhere as crews update the electricity and repair walls and ceilings. If you're entering Pease from the Spaulding Turnpike or the malls, continue on Pease Blvd. straight though the first light at International Drive. You'll see two white buildings with blue/green trim, our building is the second one. Turn left into the parking lot just before the intersection with New Hampshire Avenue. If you miss the driveway, make a left onto NH Avenue and enter the first driveway on your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the building from the Pease Blvd. side, take the elevators on your left to the third floor, and go straight across the hall on exiting the elevators to the NH Room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Other: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt; Bring other photos if you'd like feedback or critique, and be prepared to [helpfully] critique others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything photography- or photographer-related is fair game.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The gallery is in historic downtown Exeter.
