<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Would you like to visit Brazil with me next February? Will be summer and carnival there. I promised you more information and you shall have it. But mark your calendars for either the last week in February or the first week in March.Or come for both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sneak peak: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could you use a week devoted to YOUR WELL-BEING? Could you spend a week in a beautiful environment where you could rest, relax, have some fun, learn and experience new wellness trends, see a few historical sites and eat amazing food? Did I mention soaking in hot thermal water? OMG......just wait! &lt;br /&gt;

   Then come with me next february to Florianopolis, a beautiful island in south Brazil that is full of hot thermal water, beautiful beaches and amazing food. I've been going there for twenty years and would love to share one of my favorite places with you.  &lt;br /&gt;

 Come see a slide show of the fabulous places we'll be visiting at a get together to learn more about the trip. Date and time will be announced to interested parties&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bella Zadore</member_name><member_id>33517782</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361251264000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Winos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup</urlname><id>593834</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven  Wine and Dining  Meetup Group,</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350751734000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Carnival in a brazilian island!</name><id>87818982</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361232000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup/events/87818982/</event_url></item>
