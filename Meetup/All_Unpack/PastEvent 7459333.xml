Please respond yes I will come for dinner at 7:30 or just Yes I will be there later for dancing only. Princeton Station does not take reservations in the lounge. If you plan to come for dinner we need to gather up enough tables so please be sure to let us know you are coming. The music starts around 9, it is always fun to join in the dinner group to chat and get to know each other before the place gets loud and everyone is up dancing. We always have fun dancing with this band...well I do anyway! hee hee. :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll try to remember the nice signs that Brian made...or you can just look for the biggest group in the place, we are usually spread out at the tables along the back wall, next to the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207597375000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>30</count></rating><why>Great band, great people, great dancing...just to have a good time!</why><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
