Anyone think they have what it takes to win first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you a sponge for useless knowledge? Do you read classical literature for fun? Do you know what the all time highest grossing movie was?  Do you know how to assemble your own robot? Do you know in which womens' Olympic sport Ireland won it's first gold medal?  Or do you just enjoy exercising your gray matter every now and then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If so, come out for a night of Stump team trivia at Watch City. The trivia starts at 8 PM, but we will meet a little bit earlier to socialize and get some food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while it may be a &amp;quot;school night&amp;quot;, the trivia generally only lasts about 2 hours, so you should be able to make it home at a reasonable hour, if you are so inclined.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271805903000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270221229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stump Team Trivia</name><id>13067954</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271632500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/13067954/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/8/e/global_13841774.jpeg</photo_url></item>
