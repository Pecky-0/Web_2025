 Cary Fowler PhD, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust; creative team of The Fruit Hunters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators: Representatives from Somerville Growing Center&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucked away beneath the snow of the Arctic Circle is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Sometimes called "the doomsday vault," it's nothing less than a backup of the planet's horticultural biodiversity. Inside the vault, Dr. Cary Fowler and his team work with seeds from hundreds of crops that have nurtured humanity since our ancestors began tilling the soil. Their goal: to ensure that the world's food supply can survive the dangers of disease, famine, climate change, and identical GMOs. Nearer the equator, documentary filmmaker Yung Chang shows us how intertwined we are with the fruits we eat in The Fruit Hunters. Guided by devoted exotic fruit lovers, he takes us on a cinematic odyssey through nature and commerce, changing not only the way we look at what we eat, but how we view our relationship to the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exotic fruits and cocktails will be served following the program, and there will be a cash bar featuring exotic Bellinis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while you're enjoying your exotic fruits, learn how to extract and save seeds, where to trade, exchange or swap, and make seed “bombs” for random acts of gardening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets: $15 &lt;br /&gt;
