<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is an opportunity to meet new members and test drive our thoughts on where we want to go with NEPN and add a few ideas yourself. One new idea we are working is a name change. Yup, there is way too much confusion with two groups with the same name out there. Granted this is the only group on MeetUp with the name, but then most of you know the story. So, donâ€™t be surprised if you log on soon and find we have changed names. But, if you have been around here for any length of time, sudden change is part of the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Java Room has coffee, food, and wine. I also understand they make a mean Martini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;john&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's a small place, we'll find you :-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1253977206000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251932727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lowell area "Meet &amp; Greet"</name><id>11273453</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253142000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/11273453/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/a/global_9477242.jpeg</photo_url></item>
