<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A hike to Lonesome Lake in Franconia Notch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of a series of hikes for those of us who want to start getting (back) into hiking and need to build up some stamina and endurance before attempting the rockier terrains and steeper inclines! Hikes will be taken at a slower pace, with gains of 1000 feet or less and most will be 3 - 4 miles and take about half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lonesome Lake, at just over 2740 foot elevation, delivers many rewards for the relatively small amount of effort expended to reach it. For starters, the view from the western shore towards Mount Lafayette and Mount Lincoln is about as good as it gets. If the lake is calm, you may even see the mountains reflected in the water.  Just above the lake is Lonesome Lake Hut. Day hikers are welcome to stop by anytime to fill up their water bottles or give a small donation to snack on leftovers.  There is also a trail around the lake itself (although it can be muddy) and swimming in the lake for more adventurous souls! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hikenh.netfirms.com/TDLoneLk.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://hikenh.netfirm...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Even though this hike is for those of us just starting out (or starting again) please be prepared for a walk which may feel strenuous at times! Bring proper clothing (no jeans, decent hiking boots, a jacket) and carry at least 2 quarts of water and some snacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: The trail to Lonesome Lake starts at Lafayette Campground right off Route 93 in Franconia Notch.  We will meet in the main parking lot of the campground!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a camping MeetUp this same weekend...but you don't have to be camping to come on the hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/calendar/14649380/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the main parking lot at 10:45.
