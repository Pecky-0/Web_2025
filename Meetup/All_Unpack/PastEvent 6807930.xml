The Nerds are a cover band that play a range of music from the 50s/60s to today. Their shows have always been a lot of fun!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check them out:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.the-nerds.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Nerds' Website&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 9 pm, but there are three opening bands so The Nerds will probably start playing around midnight. Tickets are $12 in advance, $15 at the door but you can usually find coupons for free admittance before 10/$5 after 10 around places in New Haven.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (Andrea) can be a contact, but it is tough to talk on cell phones once bands start playing at Toad's. I can be reached for info earlier but after I get to the bar (around 10 pm), it may be tougher to reach me by phone. I wanted to post this as an event so people can see who else is going and we can try to meet up in the bar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Info about Toad's Place:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.toadsplace.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Toad's Place website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196647621000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196124315000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday 11/30 - The Nerds at Toad's Place</name><id>6807930</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196474400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6807930/</event_url></item>
