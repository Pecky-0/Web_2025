We will also be discussing the assaults on our constitutional rights as free citizens in America.  There comes a time when the loss of your freedom becomes obvious.  The choice we have is to either do nothing or become active in order to defend our freedoms as well as our country. Our Founding Fathers knew full well that this day could come and this is exactly why they put to pen the Constitution with American's inalienable rights in mind.  We will be organizing and have an open discussion of our country and states current condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be having State Representative Dan Itse to discuss this issue along with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jerry DeLemus</member_name><member_id>9270878</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363141223000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rochester-912-project</urlname><id>1452537</id><group_lat>43.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>Rochester 912 Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362618481000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NH Militia and Where else has our Federal Government been assaulting our Rights.</name><id>108000492</id><headcount>80</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363041000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rochester-912-project/events/108000492/</event_url></item>
