<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For the past two winters we've said we'd do Mt. Race and Mt. Everett but we only wind up doing Mt. Race! What's up with that? Let's see what winter secrets Mt. Everett has been hiding from us! Oh... BTW, it seems Janice hasn't been 100% honest about the contiguous piece of AT she has hiked from NY through VT. It seems there is about 1/2 mile of AT she hasn't hiked between Mt. Race and Mt. Everett. So it's time to make an honest woman out of her and you can help! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hike a looping hike of about 6.4 miles in the southwestern corner of MA. This hike is moderate to hard and not for beginners. About 2 miles of this hike follows the AT northbound and can be scenic if the weather cooperates. There is a very good chance for a good amount of ice (heavy rains followed by hard freezes and some snow in the 6 days before). &lt;b&gt;Some experience and equipment for cold weather hiking as well as icy conditions is required.&lt;/b&gt; Any questions about your ability or equipment, talk to the hike organizer. I am anticipating tha paved roads leading to the start will be passable at the time of the start given 3 days of daytime above freezing teperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will take us from the Mt. Washington Town Hall (alt. about 1480 ft.), up an icy dirt road (Plantain Pond Rd.) for 1.6 mi. (to 1800 ft.), up a trail poorly blazed orange and more akin to a steep bushwack to the northern shoulder of Mt. Race (alt 2260 ft., about) where we intersect with the AT, down to 1900 ft., and then a steep ascent to Mt. Everett (alt. 2602 ft.). If the weather is clear, we should have a good view of the area (not as commanding as Mt. Race). Then we descend a bit to a dirt road that takes us to Guilder Pond (alt 2042 ft.) and the picnic areas (and Port-A-Potty) and further on to the paved road where we hike a short distance to the cars at the start (about 1480 ft.). That's about 1.8 miles of road walking at the end though much of that is unplowed/untraveled and makes a good sledding opportunity... wink... wink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Those who wish to go MUST have:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;* Backpack - To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food, water, gear.  &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed warm hiking boots or comfortable winter boots (no sneakers!) - There will likely be ice/snow or it could be wet/muddy!  &lt;br /&gt;* &lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;MICROspikes&lt;/span&gt; (or crampons or other traction device) -MUST have! There WILL be ice! &lt;br /&gt;* Hiking poles (or snowshoe poles)&lt;br /&gt;* Gators (or snowpants) -To keep snow out of boots.&lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks - To keep those feet warm even if wet.  &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing - Avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too.  &lt;br /&gt;* Gloves - MUST have and warm ones too!  &lt;br /&gt;* Jacket - Warm outer layer. &lt;br /&gt;* Warm hat - You loose 20% of your heat through your head! Protect those ears too.  &lt;br /&gt;* 2 quarts of water - MUST bring!  &lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate food/lunch - (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advised/optional equipment depending on conditions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Headlamp - Just in case&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Snowshoes&lt;/span&gt; - Depends on how much snow we get&lt;br /&gt;* Fanny sled - for those prone to fun on a whim &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jacket shouldn't be too heavy as other layers of clothing should add to your insulation to keep warm and layers would be added or removed as needed. While hiking you WILL be hot but if you stop you WILL get very cold after about 15 minutes and thus need more dry layers added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 9 AM at the parking area at the hike start/endpoint (see location/directions below). We will hike (with rest stops and sightseeing) about 5 hr. and get back at about 2 PM to the cars. Then the plan is to head out to eat back at Higby's at the intersection of Rt. 44 and Rt. 7 in CT or you can just head home on your own.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S can provide carpooling for up to 6 from the Wal-Mart in E. Windsor ***leaving*** at a 7 AM for those interested. The drive is about 1.75 hours to the meetup location. Return at about 5:30 PM at the latest after the dinner. You must call or e-mail Kevin (number in RSVP) so he knows you plan to carpool. If no one signs up for the carpool, the carpool will be canceled and he will not go to the Wal-Mart location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail map &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;(NOTE scale is currently wrong!
