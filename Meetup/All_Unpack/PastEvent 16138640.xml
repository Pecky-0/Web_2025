What better way to begin the week than with good beer, food and the coolest bunch of people to assemble round a table?  This week we will be at the English Cellar Ale House. A fairly new addition to the eastside, but already infamous for its faux British pub interior.   Come on down as we make another showing.  Saying you aren't any good at trivia is no excuse not to come out. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography?  Every little bit helps and great conversation is guaranteed.  Game starts close to 8:00 and runs for about 2 hours!  See you there.   **** Try to arrive a little before 8:00 so that we can get good tables.  Any winnings will be applied to a future event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>c</member_name><member_id>2264651</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1296675005000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295656578000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ English Cellar Ale House</name><id>16138640</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296434700000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/16138640/</event_url></item>
