Last year at our Pizza Crawl it was decided that the Best Pies belonged to Pepe’s for Mozzarella and Sally’s for their Roasted Rosemary Potato Pie. However, we heard flack from many of you (who did not do the crawl), and numerous requests came in for a Blind Taste Test---&lt;br /&gt;The perfect venue has arrived on the New Haven Green and it seems like fun!&lt;br /&gt;We will set up a blind taste test with pizza from:&lt;br /&gt;• Pepe’s &lt;br /&gt;• Sally’s &lt;br /&gt;• Modern&lt;br /&gt;• Bar&lt;br /&gt;and enjoy the music of The Blind Boys of Alabama!!! Their close three-part harmonies and gutsy improvisations on over 60 albums have received multiple Grammy Awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring you wine, your chairs, blankets and spend an evening under the stars enjoying the best of everything New Haven offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tasting/Testing Fee to be determined….probably around $5.00&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a few folks who can assist with picking up the pizza. Please email me if you can help to pick up the pizza&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Purple and Yellow Balloons</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacey</member_name><member_id>7637795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277123763000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>42</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273594418000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BLIND – Blind meets Blind – Music and Pizza for the Soul</name><id>13449873</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276984800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/13449873/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
