The week of the event we can determine where to meet people who do not carpool in together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Office of Alumni Relations is looking forward to the 3rd annual Northeastern Big Dog 5K, to be held on September 18, 2010. All Huskies are encouraged to take part in this spirited Fun Run along the Charles River – an event that drew over 700 runners and walkers last year!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re a runner at heart, a weekend warrior, or a fan of being outdoors, this event is for you!  There’s no better way to spend a day in New England than by enjoying the striking scenery of the Charles River and the peaceful landscape of the Esplanade in the company of Northeastern graduates, students, and friends of the university. The 3.1 mile flat loop course is contained entirely within the pathways of Boston’s beautiful Esplanade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The race begins at 11:00 a.m. On site activities begin at 9:30 a.m. on race morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a fellow classmate, a spouse, or a friend! &lt;br /&gt;The race is also open to the general public … runners of all abilities are welcome -- walkers too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:        &lt;br /&gt;DCR Charles River Esplanade  &lt;br /&gt;Lagoon Area &lt;br /&gt;Boston, Massachusetts   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Advanced Registration Fee:&lt;br /&gt;(must register by September 10)  &lt;br /&gt;$12 for alumni, faculty, staff, and friends&lt;br /&gt;$10 for students&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 of your registration fee will benefit The Northeastern Fund.
