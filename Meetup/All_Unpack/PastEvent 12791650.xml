Hope Street turns into East Ave when crossing into Pawtucket, so its just over the border of the East Side. For all you Rhode Islanders - this is where the East Ave. Cafe &amp;quot;used to be&amp;quot;. Sorry. I couldn't resist. ;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doherty's is a homey local pub located just over the Providence line in Pawtucket and a FAVORITE location of P-Collective members - you know who you are! Its also a perfect venue for the Monday Night Meetup before St. Patrick's Day! It has a HUGE selection of beer on tap and something for everyone. Monday night is Wing Nite, so be adventuresome and cross on over to Pawtucket, and let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a green scarf, but we're not hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
