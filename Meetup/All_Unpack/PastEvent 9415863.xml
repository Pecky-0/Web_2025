Come for an hour or two; come for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AGENDA:&lt;/b&gt; No scheduled activities. Arrive and leave when you want. Work on your own projects at your own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/b&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST:&lt;/b&gt; $5, regardless of how long you stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/b&gt; Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups who has already attended at least one regular Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/b&gt; Your own materials and projects to work on (just as you do for the regular Meetup). A few basic supplies--scissors, glue, tape, etc. -- are available for loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/b&gt; You must RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function so we know who's coming and how many to expect. If your plans change, switch your RSVP to &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; as soon as possible, right up to the morning of the event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/b&gt; If you need to cancel after the Open Studio has started,&lt;u&gt; please call the Open Studio host so she knows not to expect you&lt;/u&gt;.  You should receive the host's phone number (and the Studio address) a day or two in advance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we need to cancel for any reason, we'll post a message here AND e-mail anyone who's RSVP'd as far in advance as we can--at least a few hours before the event--or,  at all possible, the previous night. Be sure to check your e-mail or the Web for updates before leaving home.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you can't make it this time, don't fret -- we'll be offering MANY more of these.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231695788000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230760847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another post-holiday Open Studio: Saturday, 01/03/09</name><id>9415863</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231005600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/9415863/</event_url></item>
