Usually brides decide to have pictures taken on the beach, but possibilities are endless. City streets, rooftops, garbage dumps, fields, and abandoned buildings are only few examples of trash the dress session locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A model often wears a ball gown, prom dress or wedding dress, and may effectively ruin the dress in the process by getting it wet, dirty or in extreme circumstances tearing or destroying the garment.&lt;br /&gt;It may also be done as an additional shoot after the wedding, almost as a declaration that the wedding is done and the dress will not be used again. It is seen as an alternative to storing the dress away, never to be seen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is exactly what we are going to do... Gather models - both Male and Female- to come to Oakland Beach in RI and Trash some Dresses and other clothing- while us photographers create images of it all!&lt;br /&gt;I still need a volunteer for organizing three tents-(hopefully 10x10) two need to have sides so they can be used as changing rooms. The bathrooms at this beach are not great or large. So we need to come up our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be bringing my vagabond and a ultra quiet generator so if anyone wants to bring strobes or the like please feel free but bring your own extension cords. I would say you need at least 200'.&lt;br /&gt;I need another person to bring/organize coolers, chairs, tables, and blankets - to set gear out on. The Sand is not your friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are currently looking for Stylists - both hair and makeup as well as a clothing stylist.... the more we have the better the event will be!! So please send out your search parties and see what you can gather for this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a cost to participate in the event. It is $25.00 per person. It goes toward dresses we purchase, drinks for the day, paperwork that needs to be printed and the list goes on and on... Models and photographers will need to pay. We all benefit from these kinds of events and we see it as a portfolio building exercise for all involved... money must be given to me ASAP, or by September 1st. Methods of payment- Paypal, check mailed to me, or cash... or you will not be able to participate that day. This is only so I'm not stuck with 20 dresses that i bought if people don't show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have your own dress as a model or a photographer that would like to donate one then the vent fee is only $10 to basically cover food. please contact me if you plan on bringing a dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photographers- here is the DEAL! So that means you have to give each model you photograph a min of 3-5 images for their portfolios. Fully retouched and useable for their promotional uses. They are not allowed to resell the images to anyone - only for promo use. You have one month to get images to Patrick to share with them. That means by Oct 19th, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;One month - no exceptions!! I will hunt you down!!&lt;br /&gt;Any questions?&lt;br /&gt;Patrick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW- I am also going to work on getting us some press for this event. So if you have any contacts in the media please send them to me and I'll be sure they hear about the event... Again- good for all of us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick C.
