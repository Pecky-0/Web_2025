Practice speaking the German language, sample wine from Austria/Germany and listen to some cool jazz in Hartford's beautiful Bushnell Park. Please bring: your own picnic blanket or lawn chair, a little food to share,a wine glass, and a small bottle of German wine.&lt;br /&gt; Find us between  the  state Capitol building and the bandshell, to the left of the stage just before the hill. (If you imagine the face of a clock with the bandshell being 12:00, we would sit at postion 9:00).  Look for a small German /Austrian flag. The concert starts at 6PM and goes until about 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;This is a chance to hear some world-famous jazz musicians for FREE and practice your German too!&lt;br /&gt;Rain date would be the next Monday.&lt;br /&gt;Regular German meetup still takes place at Panera.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184796124000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Deutsch speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-425</urlname><id>438488</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183758277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>German Wine and Jazz</name><id>5984772</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184623200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-425/events/5984772/</event_url></item>
