Branford is closer than Milford, and  about equidistant from West Haven, so that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Branford, 7:20 show, meet in the lobby by the ticket counter between 7-7:15. Dinner/drinks before/after if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is by request. Yes, I take requests. So for once, the peanut gallery can heckle someone else's picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmePzcsegk4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synopsis: Decorated Iraq war hero Sgt. Brandon King makes a celebrated return to his small Texas hometown following his tour of duty. Brandon tries to resume the life he left behind with the help and support of his family and his best friend, Steve Shriver, who served with him in Iraq. Alongside their war-time buddies, Brandon and Steve try to make peace with civilian life. Then, against Brandon's will, the Army orders him back to duty in Iraq. This upends Brandon's entire world. The conflict into which he is thrown tests everything he believes in: the bond of family, the loyalty of friendship, the limits of love, and the value of honor.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207868799000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207020188000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night: Stop-Loss</name><id>7645549</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207695600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7645549/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
