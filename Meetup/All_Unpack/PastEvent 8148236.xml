We will not only learn about dowsing but we will have a chance to make and use our own dowsing rods.  This is limited to 15 people and there is a $10 fee to cover materials, handouts and mileage for our excellent speaker, Kiarna Boyd, from Portsmouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dowsing is the practice of discovering previously unknown information&lt;/b&gt; through the use of intuitive tools.  It is used to locate water, minerals, treasure, lost objects and people as well as the ideal placement of structures and plants in the landscape.  It can also be utilized to find and correct forms of Geopathic stress that may impact the health of plants, animals, and people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kiarna Boyd&lt;/b&gt; is a member of the American Society of Dowsers and believes everyone can learn how to dowse. She first learned how to do it as part of her family's interest in ancient civilizations' forms of Science. Kiarna lives in Portsmouth, NH and is fascinated with the many ways dowsing can be incorporated into a Permaculture toolkit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potluck Supper at 6:00 so that we have time for the presentation and practice!&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring your potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216637053000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>13</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213563211000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skill Builder:  Dowsing for Beginners</name><id>8148236</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216332000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/8148236/</event_url></item>
