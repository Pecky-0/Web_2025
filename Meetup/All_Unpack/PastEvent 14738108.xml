Well here is our answer, lets go out to Alfalfa Farm and check out their Fall Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Festival is free unless you participate in the Wine Tasting, other events for the day are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tours of the Farm&lt;br /&gt;Live Local Music &amp;amp; Dancing&lt;br /&gt;For the kids: Pumpkin Decorating, Face Painting &amp;amp; Grape Stomping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine Tasting ($10pp 21+), and take home a commemorative alfalfa farm wine glass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have never been to this winery so we are not sure of a good meeting place. If someone has been there and would like to offer some advice, please feel free. In the meantime I will set the meeting spot at the entrance to the store. If you arrive and can't find us please call the meetup phone at 978-304-2811.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that if the weather is inclement this event may get cancelled. Please check for updates prior to heading out for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you at the winery love struck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At the entrance to the store</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287408366000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284251724000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall Festival @ Alfalfa Farm</name><id>14738108</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287334800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/14738108/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/d/global_17870557.jpeg</photo_url></item>
