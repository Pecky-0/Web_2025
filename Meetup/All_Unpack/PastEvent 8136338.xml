At last nights fly out, we all loved this idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How's Block Island sound for breakfast, rent some scooters and drive around the island for a few hours. Bike week has nothing over us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have lunch, enjoy the island, then fly back home. This could be a day trip. I expect a return about 2:00 - 3:00. Or we can change it any way we want. But, it sure sounds like a better day than working and here's your chance to enjoy this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will we want to stop at ACK for dinner? Or MVY, CQX? Any takers? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These weekday trips have been great and this is our first daytime one. Take Friday off and come along.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215992088000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213368443000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Summer Friday day off at Block Island</name><id>8136338</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215781200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/8136338/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/9/global_4218377.jpeg</photo_url></item>
