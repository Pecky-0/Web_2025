&lt;p&gt;Can't make it to Wakefield to join Frank and the crew?&amp;nbsp; Want to stay in Boston? To add to the Super Bowl festivities, I'll be hosting a viewing party at the *NEWLY OPENED* Barney Fanning's in Boston's Financial District.&amp;nbsp; In the location that was formerly JJ Stats, Barney Fanning's just opened and is ready and rarin' to host a Super Bowl extravaganza!&amp;nbsp; View their menu here: &lt;a href="http://www.barneyfannings.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.barneyfannings.com/&lt;/a&gt; or find them on Facebook.&amp;nbsp; For those unaware, Barney Fanning's pays homage to the "Broad Street Riots".&amp;nbsp; A short article is here:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://bostonrestaurants.blogspot.com/2012/01/barney-fannings-to-open-in-former-j.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://bostonrestaurants.blogspot.com/2012/01/barney-fannings-to-open-in-former-j.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barney Fanning's is conveniently located in Boston's Financial District, within short walking distance from the T (Downtown Crossing, South Station, State Street, Aquarium) and street parking is available all around the side streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drinks. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO.&amp;nbsp; And please remember to tip your bartenders/servers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will buy a drink for the first person who comes sporting some ANTI-GIANTS gear. I look forward to seeing you! GO PATRIOTS!!&lt;/p&gt;
