Our group is called made of plastic and I promise that you'll get a very good laugh from it. I believe tickets are only $5. It would mean a lot if you guys could come out and support. So drink some green ale and come out for a laugh. we're performing in the cabaret space so seating is limited I would try and get there around 8 but we perform at 830, hope to see you there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it Easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm performing :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Seth Cardinal</member_name><member_id>6243482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237509611000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236925199000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Made of Plastic Featuring Seth starring at Improv Boston</name><id>9945485</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237336200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/9945485/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
