&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I recommend wearing orange vests when boarding the bus to make it easy in finding fellow members of the group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meetup is posted to get a group together to have fun in the snow. You as an individual can choose to ski,snowboard, or x-country ski. So please understand that there is no offical organizer and who ever shows up may split into their own group accordingly by disipline and their abilities. It will be up to the attendees as to where they want to meet for lunch on the mountain if they choose to. This is quite different than other meetups and frankly tough to keep track of all who attend - So to be clear there will be no organizer to take attendance of who shows and who does not. You will be making your own decisions for the day and it is your responsibility to perform at you own abilities and hang with whoever you may choose provided you have a FUN and SAFE day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1360517698000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355798570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Downhill and X-Country Snow Skiing, Boarding</name><id>95739812</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1360491300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/95739812/</event_url></item>
