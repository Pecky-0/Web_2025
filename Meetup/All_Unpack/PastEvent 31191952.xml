  &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;*Due to popular turnout, the location for this event has changed to Cambridge Innovation Center that is very near to Kendall/MIT T station. We will meet at the lobby first and then go upstairs. If you will be late, please call Ben at 4019548570 prior to the event so I can make sure you can pass security desk to find us.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese language is always changing. Every week, my Google Pinyin Tool would tell me about many new phrases that has been added to its repository. Many of these new phrases became popular overnight thanks to the ever more popular Internet. Many of them reflect the ongoing economic and cultural shift in China. Learning about these phrases is a great way to understand modern China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to prepare some material for everyone about the most popular new Chinese phrases in 2010. If you want to know more about some phrases you recently read somewhere, bring it up too. If there are more people attending, I will change the venue to a bigger place. It will most likely be somewhere convenient in Cambridge or downtown Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonchina"&gt;China Business Opportunities Network of Boston&lt;/a&gt; on meetup.com.&lt;/p&gt;
