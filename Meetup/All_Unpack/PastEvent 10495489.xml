I fell in love with his character in Hitch.  The inveterate good guy.  And the movie's been out forever so it can't be THAT bad. (Or it's so bad they can't get rid of it. haha) Anyway, it's got to be good for at least one laugh. I cancelled it the last time cause no one RSVP-ed, but a couple of other movie buddies are hankering to see it too so we're on!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt; Join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243726375000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243358098000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paul Blart: Mall Cop</name><id>10495489</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243553400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/10495489/</event_url></item>
