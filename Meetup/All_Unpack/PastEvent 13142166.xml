<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come for just a few hours or for the entire day.  There will be games and snacks starting at 1:00 and going until no one wants to play any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a game, snack, or just yourselves.  Some snacks and many games will be provided but feel free to bring your favorites (or that one you never got to play). We have plenty of time so you can even bring those longer games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have comfortable table space for 12-16, but only comfortable chairs for about 10. Feel free to call me about the chair status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subway: I live on the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; line between the Chiswick Road Station and the Sutherland Street Station (3-5 min walk from either). Easy 10-15 min walk from both the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; Cleveland Circle Station and the &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; Reservoir Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving: The closest parking is unfortunately resident only, but there is plenty only a 3-5 min walk away on Comm Ave. For backup try Wallingford. You can swing by my place to drop things off and pick me up to help you find a place if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you would like more specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben 617-997-3545&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272499594000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270908212000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A full day or more of games</name><id>13142166</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272128400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/13142166/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
