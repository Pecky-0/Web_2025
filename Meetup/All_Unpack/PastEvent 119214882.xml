&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We are surrounded by a wealth of yummy, nutritious and/or medicinal wild plants, otherwise known as weeds. They grow everywhere and are mostly ignored, no longer valued for their nutrients and medicine, or simply overlooked. Some of these marvelous plants are native to this country or this hemisphere; many came with European settlers and other immigrants and became garden escapees and then disappeared from popular consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this walk, Iris Weaver will introduce you to these wonderful plants that provide such bounty just for the picking. Iris will focus on the plants that grow in New England, that are often literally in our backyards. These are usually the plants that have the most to offer us here in this part of the world, and they are the plants that we can most easily access and use. Some of the “weeds” that we will see and discuss include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dandelion &lt;br /&gt;

 Burdock &lt;br /&gt;

 Chickweed &lt;br /&gt;

 Queen Anne’s Lace &lt;br /&gt;

 Milkweed &lt;br /&gt;

 Evening Primrose &lt;br /&gt;
