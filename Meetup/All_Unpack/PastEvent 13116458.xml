As those of you who have met us know, we love the Euro Gamage.  Thank you, Liv, Keiran and Josh, we have now purchased a copy of Dominion.  Oh, yes.  We almost made this just a Dominion night, which will be coming in the future, but there were some other games we liked too, so we at least thought we could keep it open a little.  Mayfair games also rock, so if you want to bring your fav or try one of ours that would be cool too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have drinks and snacks but if you are so inspired to bring something, we welcome it.   We thank you all for your generosity - we love you, we love your food.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have two cats that are mostly in the basement.  Please email or call me with any questions or concerns.  978-744-7644.  Thanks and can't wait to see you all!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leticia</member_name><member_id>10156175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271460957000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270669063000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Euro Game Night</name><id>13116458</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271287800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/13116458/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/3/b/global_13157947.jpeg</photo_url></item>
