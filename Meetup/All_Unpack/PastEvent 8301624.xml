There is a silent auction, food, kids' crafts table, and something for everyone! Exhibitors come from all over the country for this show, bringing their high-quality works of art, jewelry, furniture, glassware... and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information is available at www.guilfordartcenter.org/expo.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will get there early, and we can meet by the entrance. Cost is $7 general admission, and free for members. Paid and free parking is available around the green, on some side streets, and in marked lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested, we can grab a bite to eat afterwards at Chip's Pub or wherever you choose. Please call or email me with any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For new members and those that get there later, my cell is 860.227.7498 ~&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing tan shorts and a blue t-shirt with a tan zebra on it.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216667236000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215551360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Guilford Craft Expo </name><id>8301624</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216494000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/8301624/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/0/global_4722752.jpeg</photo_url></item>
