We may want to &lt;br /&gt;postpone the maze for a drier weekend.  I think the group can &lt;br /&gt;make that decision once we are at Barnes and Nobles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be easy to find me at Barnes and Nobles.  I will be &lt;br /&gt;sitting in the coffee and treats area, with a huge book I am &lt;br /&gt;reading, Birthdays.  So come over and let's see what we want to &lt;br /&gt;do for the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciao,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francesca&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. for those that are planning to come:&lt;br /&gt;it'll would be helpful for you to go to the Yankee Candle &lt;br /&gt;website, and get all the details that are important to you to &lt;br /&gt;decide if it is a good back up plan for you and your guests.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've decided to make this event --  a Community Event &lt;br /&gt;-- Intergenerational, bring your guests, their age and marital status is unimportant&lt;br /&gt;(bring the kids, grandchildren, friend, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday September 16 - 2 events in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:00: Starbucks/Hadley&lt;br /&gt;3:00: Mike's Maze/Sunderland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 2p.m. -- at Starbucks inside of the Barnes and Noble bookstore in Hadley&lt;br /&gt; for coffee and conversation - then carpool to the maze at 3pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions and information - Barnes &amp;amp; Noble/Starbucks, Hadley MA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://storelocator.barnesandnoble.com/storedetail.do;jsessionid=ABCC1EBCF0EE6ADB65A209228CCB084F.worker2?store=2088" target="_blank"&gt;http://storelocator.b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Maze is at the Warner Farm in Sunderland.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Year's Maze   &lt;br /&gt;What a Wonderful World!
