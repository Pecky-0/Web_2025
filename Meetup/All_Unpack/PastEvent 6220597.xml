Last month while I was out of town I called him to check in and say hello and he was out shooting pool with her. I've met her once before and she's very nice and has never been anything but sweet to me and I actually like her. However, I'm not comfortable with the fact that he was spending time alone with her out at a bar on a Friday night. He and I have been together for almost a year and he's never given me reason not to trust him, but this situation has me very uncomfortable. Should I say something to him? Should I be concerned that he's become friendly enough with her to be hanging out with her after work?  |Age: 35READ THE POST &amp;amp; COMMENT &lt;a href="http://moxieblog.typepad.com/moxieblog/2007/08/oh-f--kbuddies.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://moxieblog.type...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bachelorette, Birthday, Team Building &amp;amp; Girls Night Out Events, Too! &lt;a href="http://www.moxieinthecity.net/private.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.moxieinthe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ASK YOUR OWN DATING/SEX RELATED QUESTION - GET FEEDBACK FROM DOZENS OF PEOPEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY - FREE AND ANONYMOUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.moxieinthecity.net/ask-email.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.moxieinthe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541996000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialnetworking</urlname><id>251346</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187737120000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Girls Night Out! - Sexy Sex Ed Salon for Women Only</name><id>6220597</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189209600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialnetworking/events/6220597/</event_url></item>
