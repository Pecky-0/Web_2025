<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Humanist Association of Massachusetts and Greater Boston Humanists groups have invited Boston Atheists (and all our ilk!) to join them for a picnic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a salad, drink, or appetizer, if you can. There will be hamburgers, turkeyburgers, veggieburgers, regular and fat-free hot dogs and a fruit-and-sherbet dessert provided. Cold beer (with and without alcohol), wine and soft drinks will be available. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you intend to attend, please contact Tom Ferrick, Executive Director of the Greater Boston Humanists, at 617-547-1497 or thomasferrick@gmail.com. He'll be able to confirm that room is still available -- since this is taking place at a private home, it is a consideration -- and what kind of food will be best to bring. He'll also be able to provide directions to the home, in Weston Mass., of the Humanist host. In case of rain, the picnic will still take place on Sunday, August 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249689706000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248209954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Picnic hosted by Greater Boston Humanists/Humanist Association of Massachusetts</name><id>10926524</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249142400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/10926524/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
