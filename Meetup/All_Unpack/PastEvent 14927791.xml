With a title this broad, we hope that many of you will have spiritual experiences that you'd like to talk about.  We find that as we talk about our experiences, especially among listeners with open hearts and minds, that we can gain greater insight into those experiences, why they happened, and what they mean.  We'll also share a technique for gaining greater clarity about our experiences and for having more of them.  The discussion will last about one hour.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the community room which is to the left of the downstairs entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Morton</member_name><member_id>10808254</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jamie Fairley</member_name><member_id>12983085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287137094000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285701976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Past Lives, Dreams, and Soul Travel</name><id>14927791</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287010800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/14927791/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/2/global_11631042.jpeg</photo_url></item>
