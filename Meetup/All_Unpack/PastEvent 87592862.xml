Come on by and say hi!  The BSFC group will also be joining the RSN's for the Patriots/49ers game in mid-December. Please welcome them to the fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Star is conveniently located near North Station (Orange and Green Lines, Commuter Rail). Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
