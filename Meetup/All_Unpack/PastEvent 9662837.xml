Its going to be an awesome day this Saturday at Great Brook, the temps are going to be low enough until then to keep all this snow, and then that day we're expected to get a bump to 39 degrees so it will be very nice.  So get there in time to be ready to ski by 10:00 AM.  You can be back home and doing those weekend chores by 1:00 that afternoon, refreshed by all the sun and fresh air.  Or you can keep skiing into the afternoon, bring a picnic lunch!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Great Brook is CASH ONLY and its cheap, $12 for a pass and $13 to rent skis/boots/poles.  We'll split up into at least two or three groups, and there have been enough skiers the last few meetups to have a beginners, intermediate and advanced group.  If we have enough people I'll skate with whoever wants to skate, or do some backcountry loops.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the Santa hat....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234192220000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233678303000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Brook Touring Center, 10 AM Saturday</name><id>9662837</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/9662837/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
