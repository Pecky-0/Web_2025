It took a while for me to find a book that was a neutral biography of her, but I discovered such a book in &amp;quot;Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right&amp;quot;, by Jennifer Burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goddess-Market-Rand-American-Right/dp/0195324870" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayn Rand is critical to understanding libertarian atheism, and quite possibly the last half century of dominant US economics. Not trying to understand Ayn Rand and her influence is as if you wanted to talk about socialism and communism but refused to read or understand the social theories of Karl Marx. I have read this book already and it is a neutral account of her life, her influence on our markets, and the (pseudo) philosophy of objectivism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this will both educate and stir up lively conversation... if it does that then it would make a good book for BA book and brew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Boston Atheists Table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>4427039</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292948656000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281524445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book &amp; Brew (Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right)</name><id>bmjmnynqbxb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292887800000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/14388254/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
