You will learn a healing approach to your emotional trauma by attending this Meetup in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have our first presentation by Fred Craver, PhD.  Fred will share with us what led him to write his book &amp;quot;Courageous Healing.&amp;quot;  Fred had been living with emotional trauma for many years and discovered a healing technique that has cured his emotional trauma and many others.  Fred will then take us through one healing session, if people feel comfortable with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $20 fee for this Meetup includes the cost of Fred's presentation and one copy of his book.  While many people with emotional trauma have been healed with Fred's approach, some have been so moved by his book that they've asked him to autograph it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will first order some food and drinks and introduce ourselves since we are using Uno's function room, plus they may be inclined to sponsor our Meetup group.  People may share their emotional trauma if they feel comfortable and offer each other support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly encourage you to attend this Meetup if you are suffering from emotional trauma or know someone who is.  You will receive a copy of Fred Craver's book on healing from emotional trauma and get to meet others and offer support.  You are not alone.  You will be hard pressed to find a Meetup that provides a presentation, an optional group exercise and book for $20.  I'm sure you will find this Meetup to be well worth the $20 fee and hope you invite others to join you.  You don't want to miss this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep track of what you order as the $20 Meetup fee does not include food.  Please bring $20 in cash and a pen and paper.  The Parking garage entrance is on Bacon St, around the corner.  Parking is free with validation.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Function Room so people will feel comfortable attending our Meetup.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242593997000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234306977000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Join us for a presentation on healing from emotional trauma with Fred Craver,PhD</name><id>9715933</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235088000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma/events/9715933/</event_url></item>
