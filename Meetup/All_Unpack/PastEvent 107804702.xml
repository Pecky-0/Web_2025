 April Topic: getting ready for spring planting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As spring approaches, many of us are thinking about starting our gardens. Some of us are beginners with a lot of questions. Some of us have a lot of experience to share. A lot of us would love the opportunity to talk to other gardeners about our common interest. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Jules Kobek of DIO Skillshare will be facilitating a monthly get-together of kitchen gardeners to discuss informally our practices, problems, and successes as vegetable gardeners. Each monthly meeting will have a specific topic for general discussion, but there will also be time set aside for individual questions. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Topics can include: deciding what vegetables to grow for your specific situation and needs; soil fertility; insects, good and bad; plant diseases; and succession planting. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Topics will be limited to kitchen gardening: growing food for yourself, family, and friends.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Participants will be sharing from their own experience.  There will be no formal presentations. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; covered: commercial growing, fruit and nut trees, beekeeping, chickens, or other animals.  These are all specialized areas that requires a different set of skills and knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This will be a pilot project of three months.  If there is sufficient interest, we'll continue year-round. &lt;br /&gt;
