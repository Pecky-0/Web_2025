<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Guys and Gals,&lt;br /&gt;It's time to schedule my final two meetups as organizer of the group and the group's fate will be decided by Roshi and I who are the original two founders of the group on saturday at our going away party. I apologize for this being last minute since things have been hectic. &lt;br /&gt;According to what everyone voted on, we are having our last regular meetup Friday November 6 at 9p.m. One of our members Stephanie suggested a place outside Hartford and that's what everyone voted on so that's where we will be going. It's at Butterfly Restaurant on Farmington Avenue in West Hartford so hopefully everyone can come and have a great time! Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butterfly Restaurant / Koi Lounge..831 Farmington Ave, West Hartford, Ct&lt;br /&gt;I've heard this place has a great karaoke lounge for Friday and Saturday nights!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the tall guy with red hair or just call me at 860-919-9782</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310132394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257448032000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karaoke</name><id>11804493</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257559200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/11804493/</event_url></item>
