The summit elevations is approx 3350 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike is via a combination of logging road, unmarked path and the Grafton Loop Trail. The distacne is 3 miles the vertical climb is 2150 feet. The trailbed is steep, but in good condition. In spots its similar to the Trail up Mt Liberty In NH. The hike is expected to be 4 to 5 hours round trip. Due to the large amount of vertical in a short distance, this is an intermediate hike. You should have recent experience hiking 4000 footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace will be slow but steady, hopefully so that we dont have to stop frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit of Sunday River Whitecap had no trail up until a few years ago, due to little traffic the summit has retained a fragile alpine zone. Those attending must agree to keep within the marked trail. Due to this large fragile open summit, this is a no dog hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All hikers need to have the 10 essentials in their pack and have switched their gear over to fall appropriate gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group will car pool to the start of the hike from Gorham NH. If you are coming from Maine, please PM me for a meeting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting another small group at the trailhead. The total group size will be 10 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a fall foliage hike, a forecast for winds and rain the nightbefore cancels the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dennis P</member_name><member_id>8579894</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348440032000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347649600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climb Sunday River Whitecap Me</name><id>82417652</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348405200000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/82417652/</event_url></item>
