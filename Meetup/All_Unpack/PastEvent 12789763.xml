Join the SSFMG for a walk along Wollaston Beach.  Since Wollaston is so well lit, we will be fine walking in the dark. Plan on walking 1-1.5 hours. The parking to the end and back is 4 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we have confirmed that the parking lot is open until 9pm, so no worries about the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to dress in layers as it can be windy and cool along the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this event, please contact me. THANKS! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wollaston Beach Walk &lt;br /&gt;Monday, March 8th  6pm &lt;br /&gt;Caddy Memorial Park &lt;br /&gt;Quincy Shore Drive &lt;br /&gt;Quincy, MA &lt;br /&gt;(the park by the traffic light ACROSS the street from the beach) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer(s): Julie (let me know if anyone wants to co-organize) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: At least 3 Yes RSVPs by 4pm on Monday, March 8th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attendance is unlimited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by 4pm on Monday, March 8th &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: &lt;br /&gt;We will walk if it is overcast or there is a slight drizzle.

Look for the organizers there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268262146000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267762821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evening walk at the Beach</name><id>12789763</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268089200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/12789763/</event_url></item>
