<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join me this Saturday at 8:00 AM at Panera Bread at Arsenal on the Charles for a 15 mile run. This is going to be a leisurely run. I hope to maintain a 9 1/2 minute mile pace, but I cannot guarantee that there won't be some stopping and walking (and possibly crying). Since we're looking at a minimum of two hours out there, I strongly suggest that those who choose to run with me arrive fully hydrated, covered in sunscreen, and armed with &amp;quot;gu&amp;quot; packs (word of warning: steer clear of vanilla; chocolate is tolerable). I hope to see you there. If I haven't received any &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; replies by Friday evening, I will cancel the meetup, and run my 15 miles closer to home.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heidi</member_name><member_id>8485896</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249946847000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249505053000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning 15 Mile Run Along the Charles</name><id>11044311</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249732800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/11044311/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
