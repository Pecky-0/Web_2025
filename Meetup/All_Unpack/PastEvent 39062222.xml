&lt;p&gt;Lots of parking in municipal lot near the restaurant. Review: This sequence of five long stories by the author of the audacious Red Earth and Pouring Rain (LJ 4/1/95) expands imaginatively from the modest bar of the Fisherman's Rest, where the aging, wise Subramaniam regales his listeners with tales of the deeply human in a troubled, vibrant city. Both sophisticated and squalid, Bombay provides an appropriately colorful setting for provocative stories of jealousy, loss, secrets, and love. Quietly reeling from the disintegration of his marriage, a detective becomes more than routinely involved in a murder mystery. A social climber takes on the most prominent family in town, with surprising results. In the most enigmatic and affecting of the stories, a young computer programmer discovers the low-tech bug in a client's system and a few strange secrets of a disappeared lover during one intense, uncontrolled week.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Books on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tara</member_name><member_id>6571667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329068981000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indian Bookwalas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-1439</urlname><id>1261834</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Indian Food, Indian Fiction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319818559000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February 2012 -- Love and Longing in Bombay, by Vikram Chandra</name><id>39062222</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328979600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-1439/events/39062222/</event_url></item>
