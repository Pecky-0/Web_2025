If you've never been there before, you're in for a fun surprise!  FiRE + iCE offers diners an endless array of culinary possibilities waiting to be fired up to your taste on an over-sized round open grill.  With a colorful and quirky atmosphere, FiRE + iCE entices guests to have a fun and exciting time while enjoying great food and drinks. In an age when diners have grown accustomed to asking for meals to be specially prepared to suit individual tastes, FiRE + iCE allows guests full control in the opportunity to personally select ingredients and sauces to create the perfect meal. Guests present their favorite selections to the chefs behind the grill and are invited to supervise as their food is prepared.  It's such a blast to keep returning to the grill with different combinations to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to get there by T.  It is located just around the corner from the Harvard stop on the Red Line.  After dinner we can walk around Harvard Square.  Beyond Harvard Yard, Harvard Square's historic red brick walkways lead visitors to hundreds of top notch retailers, museums, entertainment venues, bookstores, architectural landmarks, and an ever-changing outdoor arena of street performances.  I personally go just to see the street performers!  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;debbie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187649302000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186832960000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at FiRE + iCE in Cambridge (Harvard Square)</name><id>6161741</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187476200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6161741/</event_url></item>
