The Dyke Night staff is also putting together a performance, which means partygoers can see the famously behind-the-scenes, introverted Porter take the stage for once. &amp;quot;We're working on some numbers,&amp;quot; Porter confesses. &amp;quot;That's what I've been talked into.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $8 before 10pm, $5 after 10pm. 21+.
