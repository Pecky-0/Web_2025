I used to do this weekly with a regular team, but my team was annihilated by moves-out-of-state and/or significant-other-acquisition.  So, I'll put this on here in case anyone wants to join me TOMORROW, Tuesday, for Stump! trivia at Clarke's.  Note the early start time. ;) Means we get DONE early. ;) Clarke's has a $3 beer special and a great pub menu.  NOTE: Trivia is in the BACK bar area.  Ask bartender for me, they all know me. Hope to see you there! If I can get a good team going, we can do this EVERY week. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>will be sitting at bar, ask bartender for me. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291162661000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291047348000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia Night at Clarke's Faneuil Hall</name><id>15583216</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291158000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/15583216/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/8/global_6854760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
