Amulet comes from the Latin amuletum and refers more narrowly to objects with an apotropaic or protective function. Talismans represent the logical extension of a spiritual world view and have been a part of Western culture for thousands of years. Even full-fledged witches do not agree on the exact difference between amulets and talismans. (So much of witchcraft is based on tradition that some rules are a bit blurry.) However, everyone versed in the occult agrees on one thing: Whether they are called amulets or talismans, these objects are basic necessities in the practice of the Craft.&lt;/p&gt;
