Would you like to talk with our members about the EICSL Ski League and the different ski clubs to join? Here is our first summer event. Come join the fun to party with the members of the EICSL Ski League and get more information about our summer events that include hiking, mountain biking, canoeing, and kayaking. We are skiers and riders that do fun things all year around.
 
The Eastern Inter-Club Ski League (EICSL) promotes recreational skiing and ski racing at the amateur and club level. We are an organization of separate clubs throughout the Mount Washington Valley area of New Hampshire. Many of our clubs offer year-round sporting and social activities individually and through the league in addition to skiing and winter outings. Go cruise around our web site at www.eicsl.org   and learn about all that EICSL has to offer including a great discounts program.  Then join us for the time of your life!


Where &amp; When:  Join us at Tia's On The Boston Waterfront, 200 Atlantic Avenue, Marriott Hotel, on Thursday, June 19th from 6-9pm++..
