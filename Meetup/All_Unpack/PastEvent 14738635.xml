<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Are you looking for a challenge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are looking for a small group of fast hikers to hike the entire Carter Moriah Range in a day. This includes 6 4K peaks (Wildcat, Wildcat D, Carter Dome, South Carter, Middle Carter and Moriah). A few other peaks - Mt. Hight and Shelburne-Moriah - are possible add-ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 6:30 am at the Dunkin Donuts in Gorham to plan our car spot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our route will start from the Glen Ellis Falls trailhead, up the Wildcat Ridge trail, over the Wildcats and down to Carter Notch, then the Carter Moriah Trail over the Carters, out to Moriah and down to our cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Distance = 19.1 miles&lt;br /&gt;Total Elevation Gain = 7,434 ft&lt;br /&gt;Book Time = 14.5 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an advanced-level hike due to distance, elevation and pace. We plan to hike significantly faster than book time with limited stops. To sign up for this hike, you should be an experienced hiker who has recently done trips of this length--15+ miles--and elevation gain and be able to maintain a 2.5 mph pace including ascents. Everyone will be waitlisted until screened for experience by a meetup host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily Singer</member_name><member_id>7452900</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285638582000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284256825000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wildcats/Carters/Moriah Traverse - ADVANCED</name><id>14738635</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285497000000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/14738635/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/d/f/global_17873855.jpeg</photo_url></item>
