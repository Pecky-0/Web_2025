A   shaman journeys to meet his or her own helping spirits and to ask them   for guidance, teachings, and healing. Journeying with others is always   more powerful because of the supportive group energy. The more one makes   a practice of journeying, the deeper the experience becomes. Join us  in  the practice of journeying together.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Beginners or experienced journeyers are welcome.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Mia  Corinha is a Master NLP Practitioner, Hypnotist and Shamanic   Practitioner with a lifelong love of learning and teaching empowering   spiritual practices.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have not journeyed before, please come at 7:00pm&lt;/strong&gt; so that Mia  can explain more about the journeying and answer your  questions. Also,  bring your drums and rattles! We'll do some drumming  as a group before  settling into our journeys.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;When: Wednesday, April 27, 7:30 - 9:00pm  &lt;br /&gt;Cost: $20 if paid online, $25 at the door  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Limited to 12 people, register early!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please check Directions page at www.eternal-balance.com if you have not been to the studio before.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Olga </member_name><member_id>10158912</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304001330000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>It is fun and you never know where your journey will take you!</why><group><who>members with unlimited potential</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Holistic-Lifestyle-Womens-Club</urlname><id>1467921</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Holistic Lifestyle  Women's Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303742916000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shamanic Journeying Group</name><id>17423699</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303945200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Holistic-Lifestyle-Womens-Club/events/17423699/</event_url></item>
