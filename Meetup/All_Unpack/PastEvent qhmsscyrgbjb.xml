&lt;p&gt;Fresh Pond is a reservoir and park in Cambridge. Its grounds were designed in 1897 by the renowned Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today Fresh Pond is a favorite place for many people who enjoy walking, running, bike riding, and roller-blading on the 2Â¼ mile perimeter road. Birders come to observe a wide variety of resident birds, as well as numerous migrating songbirds and waterfowl that pass through every year. Artists, naturalists and students also treasure this green oasis in its urban setting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
