The reservation will hold the table for dinner but WILL NOT hold a table for the NYE event.  We will be closing this RSVP on Thursday 12/23/10 so that we can put our reservation in on 12/24/10.  If you have a change of plans and can no longer make it, please change your RSVP, if you have decided to join us, please RSVP no later than 12/23, once the reservation is closed there will be no changes made.  Hope to see everyone at Capones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on down to Capone's for a nice authentic Italian Dinner with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether its Ziti n Meatballs, Lasagna or plain ole chicken cutlets, Capone's has it all and the pricing is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group plans are to have dinner at 8pm then stay on for the next event of listening and dancing to Wild Fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on staying for Wildfire, please RSVP on that event also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that although most people will not arrive until later in the night, Capone's is not taking reservations so be prepared for us to have a possible wait to be seated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that if you are running late, can’t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, the meetup phone number is: 978-304-2811.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that if you have not paid your dues for this year, be prepared to pay them at this event. If you need to find out if you owe money, please look at your profile page where it states “Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to change your RSVP to an event if your plans change. Also don’t forget after attending a meetup event to let your Organizers know if you had a good time by rating the meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you at Capone's&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; janet&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the meetup table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293942460000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292293706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DEADLINE TO RSVP APPROACHING:  Dinner at Capone's in Peabody</name><id>15726919</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293843600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/15726919/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/d/global_20250525.jpeg</photo_url></item>
