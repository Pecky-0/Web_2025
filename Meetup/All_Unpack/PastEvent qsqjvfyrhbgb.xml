&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public. We will divide our time between generative writing exercises provided by a facilitator, and workshop sessions for writers seeking revision suggestions. To participate, RSVP so we know how many people to expect (we will cap the group at 10), and, if receiving feedback, email work in advance to the group, using the googlegroup below.&lt;/p&gt;
