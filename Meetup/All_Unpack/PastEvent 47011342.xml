A few of us who met met through this meetup are having some Sat fun. We think it would be more fun if other people from here could join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are having dinner around 8pm near Boston Common, then head to Gypsy Bar on Boylston St. we haven't made a reservation for dinner yet, because we don't know how many people would join us and we are very flexible with restaurants. And there are plenty near Boston Common. My cell phone number is 970-402 9710, since we haven't set a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just show up! We look forward to seeing you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>12675323</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326045308000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325893677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday fun: dinner + dancing</name><id>47011342</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325984400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/47011342/</event_url></item>
