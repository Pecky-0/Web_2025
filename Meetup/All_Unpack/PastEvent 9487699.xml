<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I would like to begin by sharing some inspirational words that were recently presented to me. These were written by Rev. Dr. Howard Thurman:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;When the song of the angels is stilled, when the star in the sky is gone,&lt;br /&gt;when the kings and princes are home, when the shepherds are back with the flocks,&lt;br /&gt;then the work of Christmas begins:&lt;br /&gt;to find the lost, to heal those broken in spirit, to feed the hungry, to release the oppressed,&lt;br /&gt;to rebuild the nations, to bring peace among all peoples, to make a little music with the heart…”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your New Years Resolution was to pay more attention to your spiritual life, we invite you to check out the upcoming events at &lt;a href="http://www.MoonPool.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.MoonPool.o...&lt;/a&gt;. Our mission is almost identical to that of the UUH, “To assist each person with their spiritual development”. In addition to the events listed on our website we will also be serving the Community Meals on Sat, Feb 7th. Please keep that afternoon open if you wish to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPEN CIRCLE: Sunday, 10/19/08 - 7PM&lt;br /&gt;Join members and friends of the MoonPool Coven for our Bi-Monthly&lt;br /&gt;Celebration and Discussion group. This is a wonderfully enriching,&lt;br /&gt;educational and fun circle. Learn about different ways of celebrating&lt;br /&gt;the turns of the Wheel of the Year, meet new people and learn to share&lt;br /&gt;personal experiences, stories, laughter and joy in the spirit of the&lt;br /&gt;seasons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STUDY GROUP: Sunday, 10/19/08 - 6PM (prior to the Open Circle) – Beginner&lt;br /&gt;meditation class, designed to give a broad introduction to meditation,&lt;br /&gt;teachings, and practice. The class combines guided meditation with&lt;br /&gt;practical spiritual advice that you can immediately apply as a method&lt;br /&gt;for solving the stress and problems in your life. In these classes,&lt;br /&gt;you will learn how to meditate, how to establish a daily practice, how&lt;br /&gt;to concentrate, and how to overcome distractions. You will also learn&lt;br /&gt;different meditation techniques that help you cultivate positive&lt;br /&gt;states of mind, such as patience and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free-will donations and non-perishable food items for the Church are&lt;br /&gt;appreciated as are appropriate snacks to share with the group..&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Enter around back of church, upstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232919385000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231539295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle</name><id>9487699</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231714800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9487699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
