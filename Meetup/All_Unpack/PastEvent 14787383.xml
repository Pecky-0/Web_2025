Sunday Matinees showcase a sampling of new and award-winning German films rarely shown outside Europe. All films in German with English subtitles.  And tickets are $5 each - a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a flirt in a boutique, wanted impostor Frank is arrested and sent to jail. When he is released from prison, he tries to earn his living in an honest way. One day, he meets the woman from the boutique again. For her, he would do anything. It does not bother him that she works as a prostitute. But soon Frank cannot help but fall back into his old ways and more and more loses his sense of reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dir. Alexander Adolph, in German with English subtitles, 1h32m, 35mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the film I'll be near the exit with a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284603163000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I've Never Been Happier (So Gluecklich War Ich Noch Nie)</name><id>14787383</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284908400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/14787383/</event_url></item>
