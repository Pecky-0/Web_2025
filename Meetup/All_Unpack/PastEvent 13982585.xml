Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/rpga/downloads/LFR_CharGenGd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wizards.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week's adventure takes us to the legendary city of Baldur's Gate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BALD1-4&lt;br /&gt;A distraught father has gotten no satisfaction from the city authorities of Baldur’s Gate, so he turns to sellswords in hopes of finding his lost daughter. The truth of her disappearance may reveal dark secrets from the city’s past – secrets that those on both sides of the law would kill to protect. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Baldur’s Gate for characters levels 1-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>11344282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278554885000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278081276000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms:  "Silent Streets and Vanished Souls"</name><id>13982585</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278539100000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/13982585/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
