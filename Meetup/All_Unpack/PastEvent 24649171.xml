&lt;p&gt;*note the $1 meetup fee to help Angela pay for the dues for our group.&amp;nbsp; There is a small chance I may need to cancel this walk due to another possible commitment that may arise.&amp;nbsp; If that happens, I'll cancel by the morning of.&amp;nbsp; Walk will be cancelled for inclement weather or lack of interest&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Main lot- as you come off Asbury St bear right twice</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310344379000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309899055000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk at Bradley Palmer after work- take advantage of the great weather forecast!</name><id>24649171</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310075100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/24649171/</event_url></item>
