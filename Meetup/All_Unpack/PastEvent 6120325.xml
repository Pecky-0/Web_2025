We will meet in the Papergraphics Parking lot in Merrimack, NH at 6:00 PM to make 25 additional, 3 foot x 9 foot' &amp;quot;Ron Paul Revolution&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Goggle Ron Paul&amp;quot; banners. We will have stencils, and Tyvek but we need more spray paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best paint has been the .96 cents per can stuff we found at Wal-Mart. The Matt black seems to be working well, but I'm sure the glossy would be fine as well. Please bring 4 cans of black to every one can of red. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any paint you contribute will be most appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAIN DATE TBD.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186697059000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186157434000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Banner Making Night 2</name><id>6120325</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186524000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6120325/</event_url></item>
