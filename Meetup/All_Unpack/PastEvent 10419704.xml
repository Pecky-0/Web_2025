Sometimes our dreams contain characters who give us special messages and spiritual gifts. These characters in our dreams may be personal spirit guides, power animals, nature spirits, gods, goddesses, angels, fairies, people we know, people we don't know, or even our own higher power. In this workshop we will explore how to contact these beings, ask them questions, and figure out the meanings of the answers we receive. Sometimes the answers are quite literal. Other times the answers are more symbolic. We will be doing a guided meditation exercise to experience for ourselves the process of learning from our dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In preparation for this workshop, you may do the following exercise. Prior to sleep, write up a question, like &amp;quot;What is my next step in life?&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Who should be my life partner?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What should I do to earn a living?&amp;quot; Choose a question that is important to you in your life now. Write the question on a small slip of paper and put it under your pillow or inside your pillow case. Repeat the question to yourself, out loud or silently. Address your question to a particular spirit or let your dream choose the messenger to answer your question. Go to sleep. When you wake up, write down any dreams you remember, no matter how insignificant they may seem. Repeat this process every night until you get an answer (or for several nights).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup workshop is facilitated by Deerheart, who is a spiritual advisor and dream guide.

There is a free small parking lot on Kirkland Street side of chapel, up to 8 cars. Coming from either direction on Massachusetts Ave into Harvard Square, turn onto Cambridge Street, then onto Quincy Street and around the corner onto the parking lot on Kirkland Street. The chapel is right on the corner of Quincy Street and Kirkland Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions by T: The Cambridge Swedenborg Chapel is a lovely Gothic-revival stone chapel located at 50 Quincy Street in Cambridge, Mass. Please note that the official and historical name as may be found on maps and church directories is The Cambridge Society of the Church of the New Jerusalem (Swedenborgian). We are located at the corner of Quincy and Kirkland Streets, across from Harvard's monumental Memorial Hall/Sander's Theatre, which is behind Harvard Yard in Harvard Square. Access is an easy 5 minute walk from the Harvard Station MBTA stop on the Red Line and buses - just walk through Harvard Yard and ask anyone for Memorial Hall if you don't readily see its newly restored tower, then walk around the Hall to the chapel. (We're not part of Harvard in case you were wondering, but we're close neighbors in good standing, and we host field service from the students of the nearby Divinity School).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about the Cambridge Swedenborg Chapel, check out their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.swedenborgchapel.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.swedenborgchapel.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.swedenborg...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deerheart</member_name><member_id>7399016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247616431000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dreamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonDreamers</urlname><id>1339734</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Dreamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242409666000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Asking Dreams for Guidance</name><id>10419704</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244588400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonDreamers/events/10419704/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/6/global_8634758.jpeg</photo_url></item>
