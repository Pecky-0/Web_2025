Feel free to arrive earlier if you prefer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $12 General Public; $10 Seniors; $5 Students, and free for members.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition one can attend the Jazz at the Gardner: Mark Whitfield Jr. Quartet in the Tapestry Room at 7 PM Tickets for this event are Adults $23; Seniors $18; Members $15; College Students $10. Those who attend this event can rejoin the group afterward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://connect.gardnermuseum.org/site/Calendar/1436369663?view=Detail&amp;amp;id=105482" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce's cell: 857-221-2041&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people are interested afterward, we may grab the T and head back into the city and find a pub for some late night food, and the Bruins game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside not too far from main entrance area with Canadian flag and cocktail in hand!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce Turnbull</member_name><member_id>4018534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287767470000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285541371000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gardner After Hours</name><id>ltbdnynnbcc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287700200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/14903694/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/0/global_18263216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
