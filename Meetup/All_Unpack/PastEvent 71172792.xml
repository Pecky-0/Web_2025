 The Vietnam Veterans “Moving Wall” Memorial is the half sized replica of the Washington, DC Vietnam Veterans Memorial and has been touring the country for more than 20 years. The “Moving Wall” allows a greater number of Americans to experience the Memorial. Many family, friends and fellow veterans who are not able to travel to Washington to view the permanent Memorial now have an opportunity to visit and experience the power of the “Moving Wall” and perhaps see the name of a relative or friend. Anyone who has had the opportunity to visit the permanent exhibit in Washington, DC can attest to the emotional impact this exhibit has for everyone who visits it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342437087000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340916101000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Visit the Moving Wall.</name><id>71172792</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>345600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342090800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/71172792/</event_url></item>
