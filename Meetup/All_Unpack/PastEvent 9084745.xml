The group of talented actors will take suggestions throughout the night from the audience and incorporate them into their performance. It is a spontaneous night of laughter for an affordable cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the entertainment, we will be offering a free Italian buffet included with your ticket provided by Lucca. The buffet will begin at 7pm to give enough time to enjoy before the show that starts promptly at 8pm. The buffet will include pasta, one with meat sauce and the other with veggie sauce (while supplies last). Also, there is beer and wine offered at the bar before the show where you can purchase drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unpredictable show will keep you on your toes and is guaranteed not to disappoint. Donâ€™t forget to bring your creativity because you will be a part of the show!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>7970205</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227458279000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1382</urlname><id>1275022</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Things To Do: BOSTON</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225730350000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Comedy Night at the Improv Asylum</name><id>9084745</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227225600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1382/events/9084745/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/9/global_5450809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
