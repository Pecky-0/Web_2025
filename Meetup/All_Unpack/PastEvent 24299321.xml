There will be one neck twisting, white knuckle, iron butt time trials here. A mixture of highway and secondary roads there and back in true touring form where the journey is the objective, the destination is there so we don't fall in the ocean, but take in the sights and sounds. There won't be a lot of walking around, except to have lunch, but I for one intend to take a lot of photos. Though this is a touring event it's open to all members regardless of membership level.&lt;/p&gt;We will meet at the dunkin donuts on Rt 109 in Milford. It's on the right when you get off 495 south at exit 19. Ya can't miss it! But, if you do, call me 617-584-4797. I'd love to make this earlier, but I have an appointment from 8-9 and then will head straight there.</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309673350000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309574939000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newport Stroller</name><id>24299321</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309615200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/24299321/</event_url></item>
