<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We have a great line-up for the Aug 13th meetup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Riki Fine from EMC, will present EMC's cloud initiative named 'Atmos' (&lt;a href="http://www.emc.com/pr..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.emc.com/pr...&lt;/a&gt;. With most of the cloud/SaaS companies one hears about being start-ups, It'll be interesting to see how an established industry leading technology provider approaches this exciting domain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Craig Halliwell from TwinStrata (&lt;a href="http://www.twinstrata..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.twinstrata...&lt;/a&gt;) will add another perspective about EMC's cloud initiative, one of an ISV. TwinStrata are deployed on Atmos and I know for a fact they're very busy with client engagements...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've asked both presenters to talk about:&lt;br /&gt;- Requirements they had&lt;br /&gt;- What works well&lt;br /&gt;- What needs to be improved&lt;br /&gt;- Customer traction / experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, these sessions are interactive so questions will be welcomed. If you would like, feel free to send questions / topics you would like to have one of the presenters talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Tsahy.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tsahy Shapsa</member_name><member_id>8753907</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253743306000</updated><rating><average>4.09999990463</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-cloud-services</urlname><id>1460349</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>Boston Cloud Services - All things Cloud,  SaaS, PaaS, XaaS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>50</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246404841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Cloud Services- All things Cloud, SaaS, PaaS,XaaS etc August Meetup</name><id>10773432</id><headcount>52</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250202600000</time><rsvp_limit>60</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-cloud-services/events/10773432/</event_url></item>
