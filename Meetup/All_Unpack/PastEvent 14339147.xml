Other obligations, injuries, etc. &lt;b&gt;This is an EXPLORATORY POSTING ONLY ! !&lt;/b&gt; Looking to see if there are others who might be interested in re-scheduling later this month to do it. I also have run into an issue about possibly not making this trip right now and maybe doing it in a few weeks instead. So for those of you who had to cancel - if interested in a possible later date this month - please let me know AND comment. For others who were leary of it being too hard due to being both up and down, not enough experiance, etc. - it could also be done as a HALF TRIP ONLY. Do the hike up, ride the Cog Railway back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 21st?&lt;br /&gt;August 28th?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe even Labor day weekend but I don't know if that really starts getting into fall weather on top yet or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE SEE NEW ACTUAL EVENT POSTING UNDER SAME TITLE&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>10283481</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282587902000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281103638000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Washington - Round 2 (exploratory meetup posting) SEE NEW EVENT POSTING </name><id>14339147</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282431600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/14339147/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
