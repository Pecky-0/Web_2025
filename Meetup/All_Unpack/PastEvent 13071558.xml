Now that we are done drowning (and pumping for those of us who had water in our basements) let's plan to kick off the season with the first of many Saturday morning Tennis Meetups.  My apologies for the late notice.  The week got away from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you're planning on attending.  This will be an informal Meetup and is open to players of all skill levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd also like a volunteer to serve as host for Saturday's Meetup.  I am not able to attend early morning Meetups.     I will also schedule a Sunday afternoon Meetup for those of us who prefer afternoons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hitting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Kenger</member_name><member_id>4819069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270471346000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270244196000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning at Tufts</name><id>13071558</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270297800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/13071558/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/3/2/global_8966354.jpeg</photo_url></item>
