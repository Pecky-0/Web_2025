Crew (crew.ccs.neu.edu) will be speaking about the Digital Display System they have been working on for the past year. Crew's current language of choice is Python, with that our favorite web framework is Django, which we use as our backend for DDS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Django backend is one of three parts of our buzzword compliant system. In addition we have a Linux frontend using python-clutter (clutter-project.org) to display slides, dynamic content, and videos. The third piece is a WYSIWYG editor for creating slides written with Cappuccino (cappuccino.org) that outputs slides as ClutterScript (JSON). All of the communication between the backend and frontend is sent around via XMPP (aka Jabber), thereby filling out all the squares on your Buzzword Bingo board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will give a demo of all three parts and dive into code if need be or if things break.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brett Stilwell</member_name><member_id>2081142</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256249910000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Djangonauts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>djangoboston</urlname><id>1289145</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Django Boston Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253565874000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Django Cambridge October 2009 Meetup</name><id>11429667</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255042800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/11429667/</event_url></item>
