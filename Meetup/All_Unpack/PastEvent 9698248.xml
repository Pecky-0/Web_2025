When live Irish music isn't playing they have music over the sound system. The walls are brick and decorated with an assortment of signs including the many Irish imported brews that are served. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While most of the menu concentrates on Irish cuisine there is something for everyone.They have a full service liquour license. You can order wine by the glass or by the bottle. They have a wide variety of imported brews, mostly from Ireland. This is a casual dining experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhliving.com/peddlersdaughter/index.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhliving.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menu: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thepeddlersdaughter.com/finemeals.php?l=n" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thepeddler...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236725982000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234100430000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Peddler's Daughter </name><id>9698248</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236470400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/9698248/</event_url></item>
