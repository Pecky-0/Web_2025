We will specifically look at feelings, how the mind makes things out to be worse than they are and how to take the control back to get you feeling happy and light. This also helps stop exaggerating, taking responsibility,and empowers you for clear choices through intuition rather than your somewhat biased brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fun spin on this class is we are gogi nto take mediation and 68 seconds of constant vibration and put them together. We are going to cerate an extreme focus for you and tehn set you into a votex of accomplishment. We are always assiting with creation and success herer at the center and this process is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think,... what do you wnat most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation on it. Visualize it.&amp;nbsp; create a short and reasonable plan of some type. Now we will do a 68 seocnd rampage of apprecation on it and put energy toward it with you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>www.thehsccenter.com</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334944493000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332812827000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>68 Seconds of Meditiation- High level focus on what you what!</name><id>58001602</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334874600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/58001602/</event_url></item>
