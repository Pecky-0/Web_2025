I chose Tortilla Flats in Providence because of great reviews and the central location.  You can view info about Tortilla Flats and their menu at their website &lt;a href="http://www.tortillaflatsri.com/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the event will be held at 6PM- instead of our regular time, in order to make sure everyone gets home at a reasonable time to be fresh Monday morning- ugh? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have one bill for food, which will be divided equally among members then a second bill for beverages and alcohol. This way we can order appetizers as a table and everyone can enjoy with minimal confusion and the ones who choose not to indulge in &amp;quot;adult beverages&amp;quot; won't have to worry about paying extra when just enjoying non-alcoholic drinks. Please let me know if this is a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we fill up and you are still interested in attending, please enter a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; RSVP and put a note stating that you want to be wait-listed. If spots open up, I will contact you in order of RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has not attended previous events, please plan on bringing a dollar to help me defray the cost of posting on meetup. For everyone who has attended, I only ask that you contribute every other event. This would be such a big help to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please see my piccy.
