Robert E. Lee Pruitt (Montgomery Clift) reports for his new assignment as an infantryman. At his previous Post, Pruitt was a bugler and his unit's top boxer. After a man died in the ring however, Pruitt wants nothing to do with the sport. Trouble is, his new company commander, Captain Dana Holmes, has the championship boxing team and Pruitt's refusal to box results in most of the NCOs giving him a pretty hard time. Pruitt forms a close friendship with another GI, Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra), who makes the mistake of crossing Sgt. Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine), the man in charge of the stockade. When Judson effectively beats Maggio to death, Pruitt seeks his revenge. Meanwhile, Company First Sgt. Milt Warden (Burt Lancaster) pursues and has an affair with Capt. Holmes's beautiful wife, Karen (Deborah Kerr).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voted one of the best WWII movies of all time.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251415326000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249352440000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>From Here to Eternity</name><id>11028790</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251154800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/11028790/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
