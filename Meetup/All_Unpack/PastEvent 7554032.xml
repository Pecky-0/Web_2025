Suggestions for events are always welcomed and encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!!!!CHANGE OF LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to make this event more accessible to everyone, I am changing the location. I apologize for this last minute change but hopefully this should work out better for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is still to meet for dinner and then head out to the club for a fun evening of Salsa. If you are interested in attending only dinner and/or Salsa, please mention this when you RSVP so I can get a headcount for dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dinner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: 6:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mantra Restaurant &lt;br /&gt;52 Temple Place,&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click Link: &lt;a href="http://www.mantrarestaurant.com" target="_blank"&gt;The Mantra Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place is within walking distance to the club. Please plan to arrive by 6:30pm since we will be making reservations. Also, please plan to carry enough cash with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: 9:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Club location is changed to Mojitos Lounge at Downtown Crossing. This should be more easily accessible to everyone. The Park Street and Downtown Crossing T Stations are both nearby. For those driving into the city, you can park at the Lafayette Parking Garage and get your ticket validated at the club for reduced rates ($7-$9). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: 48 Winter St, Boston MA &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Club has a cover of $10.
