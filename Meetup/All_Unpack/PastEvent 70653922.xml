&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c"&gt;Mt. Monadnock is the most climbed mountain in the world (sorry, Mt. Fuji, you’re #2). Join Sitz as we climb this famous mountain not far from Boston. We will take the White Dot trail from the Visitor Center (1400′), take the Cascade Link to the Red Spot Trail and take it to the top (3,200′). Descent will be up to the group. On a clear day, you can just see the Boston skyline 70 miles away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c"&gt;THIS IS A STRENUOUS CLIMB, WE WILL BE GOING 1,800 UP AND 1,800 FEET DOWN AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR STRAGGLERS. Proper footwear and attire are a must (&lt;/span&gt;contact Larry “before” with any questions about difficulty, clothing or supplies, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c"&gt;Bring a lunch to eat at the top and snacks. Bring, at least 2 L water. After, we will head to Kimball\’s Ice cream for a well earned treat. Plan to meet at the A-Loft/Elements parking lot at Exit 30 West off Route 128/95 where we will carpool from. Carpool leaves at 8:00 sharp so we can start the hike by 10:00. Rain cancels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
