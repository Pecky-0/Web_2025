As an Air Force veteran, Ron Paul not only understands what it means to serve his country, but he also understands the costs of an adventurous foreign policy. Both the blood and treasure of a nation is exhausted in a time of war, and Ron Paul is the only one who has been consistent in his support of a non-interventionist foreign policy for decades. That is why on November 11, 2011, thousands of average Americans, as well as Veterans, all across the country, will donate to the &amp;quot;Veterans Day Money Bomb&amp;quot; to honor Ron Paul for his service to this nation, as well as his admirable principles that have earned him the title as the &amp;quot;Champion of the Constitution.&amp;quot; It's time to bring the troops home. This is your chance to make a difference. Please pledge to support the &amp;quot;Veterans Day Money Bomb&amp;quot; by signing up to the right, and donating on November 11, 2011 at RonPaul2012.com. Please invite your friends, and tell them that it is essential that Americans all across the country donate to Ron Paul at RonPaul2012.com on November 11, 2011.
