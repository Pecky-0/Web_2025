Please take a moment to check your calendar and make sure you can make it on the 31st.  If this change in date affects your plans, please revise your RSVP accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a more appropriate day to be shooting at the cemetery?  Hopefully the foliage will hold out until then.  In any case, there are some very interesting head stones at these cemeteries that will provide some great photo ops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour of three locations on Cape Ann:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCUST GROVE and SEA SIDE CEMETERIES&lt;br /&gt;OAK HILL CEMETERY&lt;br /&gt;MOUNT ADNAH CEMETERY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.cleanandsimpledesign.com/_DLWPHOTOGRAPHY/2008/2008_10_Cemetaries/mtadnah.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Halibut Point parking lot and carpool to the cemeteries due to limited parking at the sites.
