I especially enjoyed hearing about Barbara and Joe'M's experiences serving as foster parents to monkeys that are trained to help severely handicapped people. Barbara and Joe own three Maltese, Andy, Alex and &lt;br /&gt;Finian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Espec. for Pets again scheduled a microchip clinic for the first Sunday in June, we will move our meet to JUNE 11TH so that we can retain the 1-4pm meeting time.  Everyone seemed to prefer 1-4pm over last week's 3-5pm time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP again, even if you have already RSVP'd for the June 4th date, which is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Best Wishes to Barbara Smith, one of our members, and her lovely Maltese (Emmie, Minky, Tess, Austin, Bing and Trevor) and husband Paul in their move from Wilmington to the west coast of Florida.  They left last week.  I'll miss you Barb, but you sure picked one heck of a good time to go!  I think you missed all of the torrential rains and floods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540232000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1147025328000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Maltese June Meetup</name><id>4926767</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150045200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/4926767/</event_url></item>
