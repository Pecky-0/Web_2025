<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi, this meet up is coming 5 weeks after the last one, where 2 new members came, which was fantastic! as always anymore newbies are very welcomed, I'll have a few drinks but might think about bringing what you mot like to drink, and a snack perhaps.  I'm thinking I need to make us a crock pot of my chili, which I've been told is super good- plenty of garlic (keep our immune systems in great shape for the chilly weather), beans, lean beef with plenty of mexicali spices.  Yummmmmy.  If anyone does wan to bring something, especially that goes with chilli, then yippee! Just make note of it on the message board so we don't end up with too much of the same thing.  &lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of Halloween just having passed, please feel free to dress up if you'd like.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mindy</member_name><member_id>4498017</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289242090000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Euchre Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>euchre-262</urlname><id>1040200</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North of Boston Euchre Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286153867000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quasi-Halloween November Meet-up, gobble gobble</name><id>14988928</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1289084400000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euchre-262/events/14988928/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/global_3408104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
