Major via the main trail. This trail is 2.4 miles long one way and should take us approximately 1:30 to reach the summit. Upon reaching the summit we, we will double back and  take the Major/Straightback link over to Straightback mountain. This would add approximately an additional 3 miles round trip to the hike. Therefore total distance would be approximately 7.8 miles and should take approximately 6 hours to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Mt. Major offers some of the best views for a minimum smount of hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a relatively low elevation mountain, expect to encounter cold weather conditions. Dress appropriately!! Snowshoes are generally not required, since this is a often used trail. Foot traction devices are required.  When we did this trail earlier this month, we encountered quite a bit of ice and frozen snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this a medium hike due to it being done in December. This is a great hike for individuals that enjoy three season hiking and would get a cold weather hike in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead: Parking lot is on the left hand side or Route 11 just 4.2 miles north of the town of Alton Bay. There is a sign on route 11.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dianne and I will be in a black four door Toyota Echo with Maine License plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231180063000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230130076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MT.
