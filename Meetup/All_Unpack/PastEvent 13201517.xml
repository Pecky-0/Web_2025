Need to add another hour for car spotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 20 mile overnighter along the AT covering 5 of Maine's 4000'. We can drive up on Friday night and camp out or leave early Saturday morning. We'll spot a vehicle at the Fire Warden's Trail in Kingfield,  and another car at Carabou Valley Road, then drive up the valley and start hiking in Bigelow off of Rt 27/16. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one will be 7.3 miles and over Crocker Mt. and South Crocker Mt., camping at Crocker Cirque Campsite  (tent platform, fireplace, water and latrine). For those who don't want to camp you can hike the one extra mile out to car spotted at Carabou Valley Road, then meet us first thing in the morning to continue our thru hike. We'll lighten our load and leave tents, pans, stoves, sleeping bags etc in car spotted at Carabou Valley Road. Then with lighter packs we can hike out the approximate 13-14mile to Fire Warden's Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 will be an early start going over Sugarloaf (Maine's second highest and a ski resort), then south to Spaulding Mt. and finally over to Mt. Abraham before arriving at our vehicle at trail's end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many great views along this trip. The weather can be unpredictable. Expect cold nights. This area generally isn't as rocky as the Whites, therefore mileage can be covered a little easier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get away from the crowds and the noise on the 4th!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michele</member_name><member_id>9237839</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278153064000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271437733000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maine AT - Carrabassett Valley - 2 day backpack trip - 4th of July getaway</name><id>13201517</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278147600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/13201517/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/6/8/global_14405480.jpeg</photo_url></item>
