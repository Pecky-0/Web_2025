I am ready to put my coats in storage and pack away my scarves.  But, regardless of the weather outside, we'll have a good time inside this Saturday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a while since we had a potluck, and the ones that we have had have been so much fun with delicious food.  So, please bring a dish with you tonight to share (and any utensils that you would need to serve it...some of ours have walked off).  Then after dinner, let the games begin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring any favorite games that you might have.  Also, for those who are new to the group, we are a household with cats, who will both be put away for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209291744000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204950169000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Potluck in April</name><id>7488580</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208041200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7488580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/5/global_3420677.jpeg</photo_url></item>
