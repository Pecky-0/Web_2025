Our next meeting will be on Monday night which seems to be a better option for the majority of our participants. Please check the schedule for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Markley will be here to address change on the state and local level. Here is a little bit about him:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I served one term as State Senator for the 16th district (Waterbury, Wolcott, Southington) and chaired the legislature's Human Services committee, and the Welfare subcommittee of Appropriations.  I also served a term as chairman of the Southington Republican Town Committee.  In 1990, I ran Tom Scott's nearly successful 3rd district congressional campaign; the next year, Tom and I organized opposition to the proposed state income tax, culminating in a rally that drew 65,000 people to Hartford.  I also ran Tom's independent campaign for governor in 1994.  Outside of that, I've been an English teacher and writer on and off.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Patriotism,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257115068000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255621283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NCC Bi-Weekly Meetup - Speaker: Joe Markley </name><id>11633775</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256941800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/11633775/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
