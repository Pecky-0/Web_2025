We will go there after the show for a late lunch\early dinner.  If you plan on attending both events please sign up for both so I can make the reservations at the place for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the lobby of the theater.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judie</member_name><member_id>5431837</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130664000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237812282000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>We will all be "Knowing" after this Sunday afternoon at the movies!</name><id>10014754</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238950800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/10014754/</event_url></item>
