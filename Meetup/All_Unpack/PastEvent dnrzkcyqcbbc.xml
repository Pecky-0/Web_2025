<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The program will be divided into three (or more) groups or segments.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The first mental clarity training segment, focusing on the human body as the base of experience, will be held on three consecutive Fridays: January 20, January&amp;nbsp;27, and February 3 and has been scheduled to NOT conflict with the regular Dinner with Dharma event, which is not held in January and February (but will again be held in March).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This iteration has already been filled because 12 persons (our maximum) had reserved by 9 am Monday morning, 9 January; we are hoping to offer a second iteration sometime soon after that, perhaps in February. &amp;nbsp;Please let us know if you're interested in attending that offering of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body is the source of most of the modern world's stresses and psychological problems, though that is not often realized by those who suffer them the most. The "Mind and Body for Mental Clarity" program is an integrated workshop for participants to develop body/mind insight into how body, experience, emotions, energy levels, and decisionmaking are interwoven. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will learn to think knowledgeably about how bodily problems link to distresses and dysfunctions, and to use this deeper knowledge to seek remediation intelligently. &amp;nbsp;Integrated therapeutic methods will be used, and participants are&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;to recognize&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;great individual benefit from their involvement&lt;/span&gt;. We ask participants to have eaten beforehand, not during the fast-paced hour, since the smells and actions of other folks' eating can be distracting. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

There is no charge for this training. &amp;nbsp;It is offered by a physician with background in endocrinology, psychology, meditation, surgery, and mental health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask that you not eat during the session and that if you must eat beforehand, that you have eaten before you arrive on-site, and that you not wear ANY added scents and that you not eat onions or garlic or fragrant foods immediately before you arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
