The product of his mill was shipped all over the world. It was known for it's excellence in quality and finish. His paper was used for the printing of the world's fair catalogue in Paris in 1879 and he received a bronze medal in recognition. It is also known that Mark Twain used Adams Mill paper for the writing of his books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June of 1982 the transformation to a full service restaurant began. Since October of 1982 Adams Mill Restaurant has been creating wonderful dishes in this 1880 paper mill restored to its original charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of you are already familiar with this restaraunt, but some of you may not have had the opportunity to dine at this wonderful restaraunt. They serve delicious food at reasonable prices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner menu: &lt;a href="http://www.theadamsmill.com/dinner.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.theadamsmi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;a href="http://www.theadamsmill.com/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.theadamsmi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Lynne's table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261181786000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mixing-it-Up</urlname><id>768057</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>MIXING IT UP IN WEST HARTFORD AND BEYOND</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260114078000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Out:: Join us for dinner at the Adams Mill Restaraunt</name><id>12028914</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261008000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mixing-it-Up/events/12028914/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/4/global_12110148.jpeg</photo_url></item>
