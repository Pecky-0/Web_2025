I've heard great reviews from my colleagues so decided to finally give Toro a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is a bit nippy out...perhaps the fireplace will be lit to warm us up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="http://toro-restaurant.com/brunch_menu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Toro Brunch Menu&lt;/a&gt;.... it seems rather reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MBTA:&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to plan your public transportation route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRIVING DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;tab=wl" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to plan your route&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING:&lt;br /&gt;You should find ample free parking at meters along Washington Street &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These MEMBER GUIDELINES were developed so our events run smoothly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly so we can be seated together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVP's are on a first come, first served basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO.
