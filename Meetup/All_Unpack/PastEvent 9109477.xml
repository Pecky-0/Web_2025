I put Rumney down as a placeholder but anywhere we go will be dependent on weather and temp and Rumney may be to cold. I will post a more specific place later this weekend depending on what the weather looks like. Other areas I am looking at include Crow Hill, Ragged Mtn in CT, or even bouldering at Pawtuckaway. I am willing to drive far to pull on stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you RSVP yes, please answer the questions. Or Email me directly. This may help me figure out where to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It might be cold wherever we go. You will need to provide your own synthetic clothing, long underwear, down coat, etc to stay warm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This is not a good trip for new climbers. If you don't know how to lead belay or rappel, you probably shouldn't come. If anyone is unsure of their experience level, please let me know and I should be able to gauge where you are at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also be trying to set up a carpool to wherever we go.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pete</member_name><member_id>4925014</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273543852000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226012768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Veterans Day - Get outside before it snows meetup</name><id>9109477</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226404800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/9109477/</event_url></item>
