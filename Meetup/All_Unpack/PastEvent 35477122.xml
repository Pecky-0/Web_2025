This will be at the corner of Buckland St. and Buckland Hills Drive in Manchester. There is a grassy area in the south east corner of the intersection where we will be standing. People can park in the commuter parking lot across the street behind the Dunkin Donuts. Don't have a sign? Contact us and will hook you up. There will be lots of additional signs there for those of you who just drop in.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318795470000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317317275000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul Sign Bomb, Buckland Hills Mall October 10th</name><id>35477122</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318278600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/35477122/</event_url></item>
