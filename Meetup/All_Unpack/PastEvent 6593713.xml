This ultra-chill lounge has great music and atmosphere.  A fun place to meet new people and to get your groove on!  All members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8:30pm in the bar area at Les Zygomates (129 South St in the Leather District by South Station, it is a French restaurant)  We will head over to District around 10:00pm to beat the lines.  Please meet us before 10pm, as you may not find us later.  Expected cover: I do not believe there is a cover, but the key is to come early with the group.  Expect to pay $10, but it should be less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;District is an upscale venue, so please dress appropriately.  If traveling by T, District is closest to South Station on the red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no baseball game on Friday, so hope to see you there!
