&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is played just like the Hearts game on most computers, except with two decks and any two exact cards cancel out and the next highest collects the played cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We use "deal" all cards and last card is not played if everyone does not have a card.  &lt;br /&gt;They go in the dead pile with (no high card) rounds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep the game sociable people can come in and out of the game at the MEDIAN of points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only the third time we have played and are still tweaking our (HOME) rules to make the game as sociable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At DAMATAS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New players welcome, we will teach you how to play.  &lt;br /&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be discouraged enough not to sign up on the waiting list, if full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no charge for this meetup, however it is suggested that you get a drink or something else there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pizzas are &lt;strong&gt;$2.99&lt;/strong&gt; on Monday nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is now a modest membership fee of $2.00 quarterly. the fee is for the whole group not just Kitty Whist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see "How to pay: Pay online or by cash or check" and " Pay online " on the home page of the group.  &lt;br /&gt;If you are a Kitty Whist/Hearts player please mention that you are a Kitty Whist/Hearts player, when you pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the one with the decks of cards.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300198972000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299704913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Negation Hearts  at DAMATAS in Salem</name><id>16862457</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300141800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/16862457/</event_url></item>
