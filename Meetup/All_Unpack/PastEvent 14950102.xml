Steere and his son Henry J. Steere. Today, Jim Steere, grandson of the original owner, and his son John continue the tradition. It is one of the oldest and largest orchards in the state. All apples sold at the farm stand are grown at the orchard. The orchard also specializes in peaches, which are available until mid September every year.
