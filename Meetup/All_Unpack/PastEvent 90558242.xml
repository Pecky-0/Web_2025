&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We've got a great speaker this month, as Boston-area Rubyist Dan Pickett will be giving a talk on building happiness-inducing command-line applications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Command Line Interfaces With Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increasing popularity of internal tools and the desire to build utilities that save you time, it is often handy to be able to whip up Ruby command line applications to make you more productive and happy! In this talk, we'll explore libraries that can help you write command line interfaces and libraries that will help you test them. We'll focus on Thor and Aruba to get things done on the command line, while covering the aspects of unit testing vs. acceptance testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darren Torpey</member_name><member_id>11731047</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352990261000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Rubyists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>route9rubygroup</urlname><id>389347</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Route 9 Ruby Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352404747000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nov 2012 Route 9 Ruby: Dan Pickett on Building Command Line Interfaces with Ruby</name><id>90558242</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>9000000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352932200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/route9rubygroup/events/90558242/</event_url></item>
