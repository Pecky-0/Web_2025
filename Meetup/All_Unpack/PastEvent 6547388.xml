When you RSVP please put in comment box what you would like to bring to share....ex.. of snack, drink, etc.. I would like to see a good turn out for this event...   &lt;br /&gt;       My daughter in-law will be here with a Pampered Chef catalog and will be in the house for anyone interested in seeing what that is all about..  Please do not feel obligated to buy.. She just started and has to hold 3 meetings this month... so I told her she could set up here and it could count as one...  I hope no one feels this is tacky... just trying to help her while my son is in Iraq.  &lt;br /&gt;         If anyone has a digital camera.. please bring it and then we can share our photos on the web..... &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193842754000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192368522000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>HALLOWEEN PUG/COMPANION DOG PARTY </name><id>6547388</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193592600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/6547388/</event_url></item>
