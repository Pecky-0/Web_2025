Cambridge, MA 02142 This event requires registration: &lt;a href="http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=226543"&gt;http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=226543&lt;/a&gt; Come join your colleagues at the next BiotechTuesday, This month we will meet at KIKA, a brand new Spanish tapas restaurant in Kendall Square. KIKA has the same owners as Tapeo and Solea, and features a modern European interior design that makes you feel like you are in Barcelona. The restaurant is behind EVO pizza on Third Street in Kendall Square (walk down the sidewalk from Third Street). This month we will also be offering a dinner option from 5:30PM to 7PM in the dining area on the first floor. These dinners are a great way to build new connections by learning a lot about the members seated with you. The fixed price menu is $35 for four tapas (both hot and cold) or $45 for the tapas plus 2 drinks (House wine, beer or their tasty Sangrias). Please note: If you are not a member of BiotechTuesday, you need to purchase a ticket to the event in order to attend the Pre-Event dinner.</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326844250000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325984064000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biotech Tuesday</name><id>47133962</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326839400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/47133962/</event_url></item>
