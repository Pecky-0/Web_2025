&lt;p&gt;Oh my, the front (green) sections are already selling out at McCoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pawsox won their division last year, &amp;nbsp;hoping to see them repeat the effort this year. On opening day they will be playing the Buffalo Bisons. &amp;nbsp;The Bisons were at the other end of the division with a record almost exactly opposite the Pawsox. &amp;nbsp;And Channel 10 is doing the pre game ceremony. &amp;nbsp;(So be careful about singing along with the ceremony or at other points in the game, you might end up on TV like Jeff G. did a while back)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm planning to get tickets in Section 8 Red. We should be under cover there (you never know when you need it with New England spring weather), and have a good view down the first base line. &amp;nbsp;I'll probably purchase tickets within the week, so we can get seats in the reserved section. &amp;nbsp;I'll post more details when I've bought tickets (what section they are in, who's paid, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is scheduled to start at 7:05. &amp;nbsp;Tickets in the reserved sections are $11. &amp;nbsp;Contact me for payment options :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
