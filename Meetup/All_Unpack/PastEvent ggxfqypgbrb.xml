Feel free to suggest games  that you want to play, although we'll probably audible based on who  shows up at the door. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; On a related topic, I've pulled dozens of titles from my collection in  an effort to clear out space on the shelves and get the piles off the  floor. Lots of good games for sale, along with lots of middling ones and  a single copy of Smiley Face. I have general guidelines for pricing,  but I'm open to lowball offers as I primarily just want stuff out of my  house. No list yet for those who want to browse for bargains &amp;ndash; you need  to come by and check out the stacks!&lt;/p&gt;
