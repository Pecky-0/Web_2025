In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: &amp;quot;Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.&amp;quot; Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next. &lt;br /&gt;The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches--stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition--with explorations of how and why we read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. &lt;i&gt;If on a Winter's Night&lt;/i&gt; is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. &amp;quot;What makes loving and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1294720499000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292600403000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Calvino: If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</name><id>15758815</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294614000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/15758815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
