Kingston RI &lt;br /&gt;

 . &lt;br /&gt;

 Barry is running for U.S. Senate in Rhode Island with the goal of restoring our great nation&amp;rsquo;s security and ensuring a prosperous future for our children. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Barry Hinckley&amp;rsquo;s forebear, Col. James Barrett, commanded the Minutemen of Concord and is famed for having fired one of the first shots at the advancing British across the North Bridge. "The status quo today spells disaster for this nation. Fortunately, changing the status quo is a Hinckley family tradition." Said Hinckley. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Barry has witnessed rampant government regulation drive jobs and revenue out of his State, weakening its core industry. Every Rhode Island family has endured the fallout from these harmful policies in some way, and have a poignant story to tell.&amp;nbsp; "For too long, politicians have kicked the &amp;ldquo;entitlement reform&amp;rdquo; can down the road hoping someone else will fix the problem. Barry believes the federal government must stop looting the Social Security Trust Fund and treating it like its own personal petty cash drawer." (Feel free to come early to socialize and grab a quick bite to eat) &lt;br /&gt;
