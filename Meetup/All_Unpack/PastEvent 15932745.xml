This will be our first Meetup of 2011. It will run from 1:00 to 2:30pm. I hope to see some of our new members, some old familiar faces, and some of you who have been lurking in the background. Now's your chance to make a resolution to improve your health in the new year by practicing Qigong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Chinese tradition, the winter season corresponds to the element water and the kidneys, which rule yin, yang, and essence, the foundational energies and substances of the body. Since it's the cold of winter, we'll do some Qigong to strengthen the kidneys, and also warm up our internal fire, melt coldness in the meridians, and strengthen our immune systems. There will be an introduction first, the content of which will depend on who shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Best,&lt;br /&gt;Dee&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Lucia Mastrangelo Room is the glass-walled room on the second floor across from the reference desk.
