All forms of communication have been jammed by an enigmatic transmission that preys on fear and desire driving everyone in the city to murder and madness.  In a place once marked by conformity but now sent into complete anarchy, the rebellious Ben must save the woman he loves fro the bedlam in the streets as well as her crazed sadistic husband.  But the only way he can tell who to trust or who has given in to violence is by uncovering the true nature of The Signal.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in three parts from three unique perspectives by three visionary directors, THE SIGNAL was originally conceived as an experimental film project called Exquisite Corpse where one filmmaker would begin a story then hand it off to another filmmaker to continue and then to another and so on until the movie was complete.  The story eventually took shape and evolved into a sci-fi/horror/thriller that imagines a world where everyday anxieties became the catalyst for inhuman terror.  The Signal is a horrific journey towards discovering that the most brutal monster might actually be within all of us.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening in theaters: February 22, 2008&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[edit by JediFonger]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/225256/The%20Signal%20Kendall%20Pass.jpg"&gt;http://files.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^free moviepass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;show up@6PM and prior to get seats. 10x sarah!&lt;br /&gt;[end edit]&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chelsea</member_name><member_id>3861711</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207483054000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>A brief Q&amp;A session with The Signal's directors DAVID BRUCKNER, DAN BUSH and JACOB GENTRY will follow this special advanced screening.</why><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202929636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>** FREE ADVANCED SCREENING &amp; DIRECTOR Q&amp;A - THE SIGNAL **</name><id>7325276</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203033600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/7325276/</event_url></item>
