With bellies full of wine* and spirits high, it is time to play a little frisbee. No, we did not play on Christmas day. That doesn't make us quitters, though. Just Jesus-conscious. You kind folks have spoken, you have shouted from the mountaintops: &amp;quot;WE WANT FRISBEE!&amp;quot; And like God with his fancy light tricks, I respond: &amp;quot;LET THERE BE FRISBEE!&amp;quot; And there was frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO! This Friday, seven o'clock, Cambridge Common. The Usual. After a long day in a cubicle at the office, staring at the gray walls, wondering whether there is more to life, you will show up to frisbee and your question will be answered. YES, there is more to life! The answer is frisbee! Glorious, glorious frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, I know: frisbee on Friday night? Uncool, right? WRONG! Frisbee is the coolest thing on such a night. What is better than pure, unadulterated exercise? Nothing, I say, nothing! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO! I hope to see you all there. The field has seen better days, but so have we all. We will play regardless of the conditions. Afterwards, we will dine, wine, and enjoy each others company. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your holiday cookie,&lt;br /&gt;Chris&lt;br /&gt;781 301 1791 (call for directions, phone hugs, and general nonsense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Here's Jim's cell, just in case I'm way too cool to answer your call: 617-335-4191&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,&lt;br /&gt;But she doesn't have a lot to say.&lt;br /&gt;Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,&lt;br /&gt;But she changes from day to day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to tell her that I love her a lot,&lt;br /&gt;But I gotta get a bellyful of wine.&lt;br /&gt;Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,&lt;br /&gt;Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Someday I'm going to make her mine.&lt;/i&gt; (- Beatles.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the glowing-frisbees and bright smiles.
