Carlos tells the story of Ilich Ramirez Sanchez (Edgar Ramirez, Che), who for two decades was the most wanted terrorist on the planet. A myth in his own lifetime, Carlos is a central figure in the history of international terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, from pro-Palestinian activism to the Japanese Red Army. He was a figure of the extreme left and an opportunistic mercenary in the pay of powerful Middle Eastern secret services. &amp;quot;An astonishing film.... it takes on biography, international politics, terrorism, history, religion, sex, and much more and handles all the issues with staggering dexterity, intelligence and skill. It's terrific,” Todd McCarthy, indieWIRE. In French, English, Spanish, German, and Arabic with English subtitles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for the last minute posting.  I just discovered this on Tuesday morning.  If Friday doesn't work for you, it is also playing Saturday when I'll be working.  I bought my ticket on line, but I have no idea if that is necessary.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll go to a nearby restaurant for food and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the first row on the right side of the theatre after the film with my MEETUP sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>3369401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288098897000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Carlos</name><id>15232447</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288384200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/15232447/</event_url></item>
