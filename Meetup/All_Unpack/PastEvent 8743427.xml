For this first meeting we chose the text up to and including Section II: Time of Part I (Transcendental Aesthetic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will not be a problem that we switched from meeting the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of the month to the 1st and the 3rd. This semester the Goethe Institute philosophy group meets on the last Thursday of the month, we avoid conflict by switching. This is the reason why our next meeting is the 1st Thursday of October, 3 weeks away from our last meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the philosophy group from the staff.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224200269000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221225302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kant: Critique of Pure Reason</name><id>8743427</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222988400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/8743427/</event_url></item>
