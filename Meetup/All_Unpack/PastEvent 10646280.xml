Please look at the following link it takes you to a trail map and below the map are descriptions and length of each trail and rates them for ease-difficulty of hiking.  Come to the hike with an idea of which ones you would like to go on or avoid.  Starting at the end of Brook Road can give us the most options I think although we could also start at the parking lot off of Chestnut Hill as well.  In any case you could always place preferences ahead of time in the comments section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I put down the address of Peabody Mill Environmental Center as it is at the north end of Brook Road and is located inside of Joe English Reservation.  We would most likely meet in the parking lot just before getting to the Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clicking on the cameras in the next link will show you a picture of the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://Joe English Reservation" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.svlt.org/Trails/TractMap.asp?TownName=Amherst&amp;amp;TractName=Joe+English+Reservation#Timber" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.svlt.org/T...&lt;/a&gt; Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next link also sends you to a website about Joe English Reservation which also besides a description of the Reservation gives you another link to a trail map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://Joe English" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amherstnh.gov/acc/consjoeenglish.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amherstnh....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a group of dogs and white suzuki grand vitara - License plate- DOGPARK</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246216691000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244937350000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Joe English Reservation</name><id>10646280</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245510000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10646280/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/5/5/global_9239205.jpeg</photo_url></item>
