The plan will guide future preservation and stewardship efforts in the state forest, and will ensure consistency between recreational uses and protection of natural resources. &lt;br /&gt;As a first step in the process, DCR has scheduled the public meeting for Thursday, October 28, 2010, from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., in the Carver High School Auditorium, 60 South Meadow Road, Carver.&lt;br /&gt;“Myles Standish State Forest is a beautiful park, offering innumerable recreational opportunities,” said DCR Commissioner Richard K. Sullivan Jr. “With 16 ponds, five camping areas, plus hiking, cycling, and horseback-riding trails, it is the largest publicly owned recreation area in southeastern Massachusetts. Our goal at DCR is to protect the natural and cultural resources of the forest, and develop plans to manage it in the years to come. We welcome public input as we move forward with the Resource Management Plan.”&lt;br /&gt;Under the Patrick-Murray Administration, DCR has begun developing Resource Management Plans (RMPs) for all agency properties. DCR has evaluated individual parks and prioritized them based on their natural and cultural resources, management issues, and uses of the facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the October 28 public meeting, DCR staff members will share information about the resource management planning process, and members of the public will be invited to talk about various aspects of the state forest, including how they use it, what aspects of it are important to them, and what they feel should be protected and how. &lt;br /&gt;The presentation will be available on DCR’s website after the public meeting: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/news/publicmeetings/rmppast.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/news/publicmeetings/rmppast.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come up the stairs and into the conference building.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290097810000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287601204000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FMSSF "Resource Management Plan" Focus Group-Vernal Pools &amp; Ponds Management</name><id>15173562</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290038400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/15173562/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/0/global_18814832.jpeg</photo_url></item>
