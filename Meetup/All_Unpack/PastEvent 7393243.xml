<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We had such a happy group of dogs for our Feb meetup!  Hopefully we will get the same turn out for March.  I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that the weather is better in March and maybe we can have the meetup outside, but if not, we always have the large indoor play room.  Also, let your friends know if they have a social dog who needs some excitment!  Hope to see you then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held at Best Friends Pet Care off of Rt-97 less than a mile from I-95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206491841000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203793618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs March Meeting</name><id>7393243</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206205200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/7393243/</event_url></item>
