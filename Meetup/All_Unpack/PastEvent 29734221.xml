  &lt;em&gt;365 Degrees Consulting is all about empowering people to create meaningful careers. From working one-on-one with job seekers and aspiring entrepreneurs to partnering with large corporations and small businesses, my message is always the same: figure out who you are and what you want, and apply this knowledge to your career. This can be conveyed through creating a personal brand, networking with like-minded individuals, creating your own business, networking with your co-workers and getting to know high level executives who can help you get ahead, or finding your next dream position. The world of careers revolves around one central message: stop waiting and start creating. Rather than wait for your career to start tomorrow or when someone notices your talent, why not build what you want today? If not today, when?&lt;/em&gt;
