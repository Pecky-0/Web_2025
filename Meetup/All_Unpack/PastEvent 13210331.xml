We'll have a quick overview of the works on the subject, but then will be sharing our own thoughts and experiences on the subject... and tips on how to make the Law of Attraction work for us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several groups that focus on this concept alone - but as the New England Metaphysical Club hasn't talked about the subject since the group was re-started it will be good to do a session on this simple but powerful concept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have to be an expert on &amp;quot;The Secret&amp;quot; to participate this month - but if you have a story about a time when your thoughts or energies seemed to cause an event in your life, please come and share it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Dawnie will have some herbal tea brewing, and there will be some light snacks.  The sessions usually go about two hours.  Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>William </member_name><member_id>4792394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274008295000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Metaphysics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metaphysics-387</urlname><id>682186</id><group_lat>43.4399986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7600021362</group_lon><name>The New England Metaphysical Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271535016000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May 2010 Meetup</name><id>13210331</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273960800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/metaphysics-387/events/13210331/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/1/3/global_12047907.jpeg</photo_url></item>
