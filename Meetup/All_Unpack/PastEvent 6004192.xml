If you think a thought and back it up with emotion, it becomes a creative force. -- Neale Donald Walsch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your thoughts are made up of words.  Your words are usually associated with emotions and therefore generate positive or negative vibrations.  Think &amp;quot;summer&amp;quot; and I bet a lot of us have very light, happy feelings.  Think &amp;quot;winter&amp;quot; and I, for one, feel sadness and discomfort.  Guess what vibrations you want to consistently give your attention, energy and focus to and sending out? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chew-Hoong Koh, co-organizer of BostonLOA meetup, will facilitate the discussion of using various emotional guidance systems and mood shifters to fine tune your emotions to vibrate more positively and consistently on a daily basis.  Let's learn and share how to turn up the volume on empowering creative emotions and pull yourself out of the negative ones that drag you down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein Alhadi, realtor and BostonLOA member, will share with you a simple yet powerful way of acknowledging and releasing feelings around a negative or limiting belief and/or thought. &lt;br /&gt;This basic releasing technique is used by some of the teachers of The Secret like Jack Canfield and Hale Dwoskin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much, Hussein for your willingness to share at our September meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to re-connecting with everybody again next Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ChewHoong and Dave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Chew-Hoong Koh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ChewHoong's joy is to inspire and help transform quality of lives...one person, one family at a time...through living joyously with gratitude and being of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With contagious exuberance, she enjoys assisting both small and large businesses align and deepen relationships with clients through innovative marketing/ sales &amp;amp; business strategies and implementations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Hussein Alhadi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein is a realtor, on a personal journey to be a life coach to serve &amp;amp; help people overcome their adversities &amp;amp; manifest their true desires.
