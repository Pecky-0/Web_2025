We will see a waterfall, stone walls, carriage path, and  Case mansions, as well as forest and ponds. Wear sturdy shoes or  sneakers and expect some wet spots, very steep climbs, and bumpy  terrain. The hike and commentary will take about two hours. Participants  in this moderately paced (but strenuous) hike will learn basic hiking  skills and, depending on the weather, view the Hartford skyline from the  summit of Case Mountain. We will view property owned by the Town of  Manchester and by the Manchester Land Conservation Trust. Led by Susan  Barlow. Hike starts at the Spring Street trailhead: From Hartford, take  I-84 eastbound to I-384, exit 4, right off exit ramp. Follow Spring  Street down a curve and then down a steep hill, over a one-lane bridge.  Parking along one side of Spring Street, with a little parking at the  trail head. Extreme weather cancels. No dogs, please.&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/d/7/event_24784311.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue backpack</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312295331000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>68</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305485492000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Highland Park History Hike</name><id>18458731</id><headcount>75</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312045200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/18458731/</event_url></item>
