Feel free to join us for the performance, the movie, or both. &lt;br /&gt;

On Friday, April 20th, Firehouse 12 welcomes saxophonist Mike DiRubbo and pianist Larry Willis in a duo performance presenting music from their 2011 album Four Hands, One Heart (Ksanti Records). New Haven native DiRubbo has previously performed at Firehouse 12 with trombonist Steve Davis. This performance is his first as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics have praised DiRubbo’s “big, bold alto tone. . .unerring time feel and remarkable facility on the instrument” (Bill Milkowski, Jazz Times) and have noted that he “plays with fire and intelligence, and his music dances with life” (Francis Davis, Village Voice). Willis’s playing is known for his “smart harmonies and deft rhythmic interplay” (Donald Elfman, All About Jazz) and solos that link “the spareness and linearity of Bud Powell to the modernistic harmonies of Herbie Hancock” (Jon Pareles, New York Times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiRubbo entered the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz at the Hartt School, University of Hartford in 1988 and studied with McLean, Hotep Galeta, Peter Woodard, Nat Reeves, and Rick Rozie. He has since gone on to perform regularly as both a leader and a sideman in and around New York City and abroad in Europe and the Middle East. With seven CDs as a leader, he has been featured in articles, reviews, and interviews in Jazz Times, Downbeat, Cadence, and All About Jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willis has been performing since the early 1960s. His first trio consisted of classmates drummer Al Foster and bassist Eddie Gomez. He was discovered by saxophonist Jackie McLean and performed on his album Right Now!. He went on to perform and record with artists as diverse as Dizzy Gillespie, Woody Shaw, Cannonball Adderley, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, and Afro-Cuban jazz group Fort Apache.&lt;/p&gt;

The Raid: Redemption (10:10pm, Criterion Theater, 86 Temple Street) &lt;br /&gt;

A police raid on a Jakarta tenement building turns into a non-stop bloodbath when the drug dealer who owns it unleashes a furious barrage of fists, bullets, and blades, leaving the few remaining survivors of the invading SWAT team to fight their way up to the top and end the psychotic criminal's violent reign once and for all. Expectant father Rama (Iko Uwais) is an honest cop with deadeye aim and killer fighting skills. Following orders from his lieutenant -- a respected police veteran and mastermind of the ambitious raid -- Rama leads his heavily-armed team into the building silently and stealthily. Their mission is to take down Tama (Ray Sahetapy), a vicious criminal kingpin who uses the building as a shelter for both his many customers and his small army of loyal dealers and killers. Even the bravest cops in the city have never dared to breach Tama's fortress, and once the team's cover is blown, it quickly becomes apparent why; almost immediately, half of the team is shredded in a vicious barrage of gunfire and machetes. The exits have all been blocked, and with Tama's men closing in fast Rama's only hope is to keep going up and take out anyone who gets in his path. Meanwhile, Tama realizes that some of the cops have managed to survive the initial assault, so he unleashes two of his best men to stop them dead in their tracks. With his team cut down to a mere handful and his munitions exhausted, the determined cop vows to complete his mission by whatever means necessary. The Raid made its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, where it quickly gained buzz thanks to an enthusiastic audience reception, while also garnering the Cadillac People's Choice Midnight Madness Award. ~&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334971999000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334950627000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live Jazz Performance and Movie Night</name><id>61435222</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334967300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/61435222/</event_url></item>
