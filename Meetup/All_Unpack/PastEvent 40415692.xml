It's not too late in the season to start composting. In fact, with the combination of falling leaves and kitchen scraps, you've got a great beginning. This month's Edible Garden Group gathering will focus on composting with a presentation and information sharing about the what, why and how of composting. The Edible Garden Group was formed by community members who are interested in getting together to learn and share information about sustainable food growing &amp;#150; veggies, fruits, nuts. The meetings are facilitated by Transition Newburyport as part of our interest in building community resilience through increasing the availability of safe, nutritious, sustainably-grown local food.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elizabeth </member_name><member_id>389569</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321319739000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320771917000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cook that Compost!</name><id>40415692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321315200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/40415692/</event_url></item>
