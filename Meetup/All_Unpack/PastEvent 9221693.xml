It is not just theater used to set the mood. It is a way of expressing honor and connecting to the spirits. A recommitment to music can bring sacredness not only to rituals, but also into daily life and home, bringing you back in balance. When you reflect on the magick, energy and wonderful people that music can bring into your life, you will be truly thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPEN CIRCLE: - 7PM&lt;br /&gt;Join members and friends of the MoonPool Coven for our Bi-Monthly Celebration and Discussion group.
