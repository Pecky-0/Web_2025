Although some of the latest and greatest changes that Meet Up has made, has been, well...shall we say, not so helpful, we still must pay the fees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last March we passed around a coffee can at an HH and collected a $1 or $2 per person to help towards the funding of the URL. We graciously accepted the $44 we received. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROBEN feels it's time to pass around the coffee can for your contributions. It will be at the HH on 1/28 at Richter's as well as the next few events in which ROBEN is attending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you in advance for your generosity. We all appreciate it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Management&lt;br /&gt;ROBEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>23</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201734596000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200008885000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>1/28 Happy Hour - RICHTER'S</name><id>7084126</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201561200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7084126/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/8/c/global_351724.jpeg</photo_url></item>
