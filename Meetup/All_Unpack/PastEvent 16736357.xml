&lt;p&gt;Come meet like-minded adventure travelers who are interested in exploring exciting and off-the-beaten-path destinations around the world. Share stories of past adventures and talk about future ones!  Among many things, we usually discuss actual up-coming club group tours, as well as trips that members have taken, would like to take or dream of taking. We typically have 10 - 15 people show at our meetups!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter whether you are a solo traveler, a couple or just friends; everyone is welcome. Please contact me if you'd like to attend so I can be sure to keep an eye out for you. Email Kevin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet in the Cataqua Pub at the Red Hook Brewery in Portsmouth... Look for Kevin... I will be wearing a bright yellow baseball cap with beer in hand!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We meet in the Cataqua Pub at Red Hook... Look for Kevin...
