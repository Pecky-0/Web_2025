&lt;p&gt;Meetup dues are $3 per Frenchie... the South Boston Bark Park is community funded so a portion of the dues will go to to the SB Bark Park and the rest to help cover the $12 monthly fee to host our meetup.com group online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Frenchie's canine brothers, sisters and friends are more than welcome to join us at the park! We will meet in the large enclosure so we will be sharing the space with other dogs and visitors (the small enclosure here is typically used for dogs that do not socialize well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind it is still off season so you can also take your Frenchie for a stroll along Carson Beach as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your Meetup on and come join the fun, there is visitor parking on Columbia Blvd and some of the side streets (look for the signs identifying visitor sections - you are probably safe to park in resident sections on Columbia for an hour or 2 as well but you do risk getting a ticket).&lt;/p&gt;
