So I consulted my steering committee and they chose the date of Thursday, December 9.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 6:00 at E &amp;amp; O Tap at 289 Knight St.  Around 7:30 we will move to The Avery, 18 Luongo Memorial Sq.  At 9 we will hear the call of Julians (318 Broadway).  (And they really don't use an apostrophe in their adverts, for all you punctuation sticklers out there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at just one or join us as we bar-hop.  Park once and walk to all three.  (Hopefully, no cars will be towed this time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've heard the stories.  Come join us as we try to recreate the magic.  See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look at Bruce's picture!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce B</member_name><member_id>11410054</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291955728000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291342906000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beermuda Triangle II</name><id>15627133</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291935600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/15627133/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/b/global_5889099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
