We will be meeting to having Coffee, tea and conversation.  This is a great way for those who want more of a chance to practice their Chinese Conversation and to get to know each other better.  Also, if you can't make it to our Monday Meetups, this is another chance to join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only money you have to bring is that for Coffee, tea, and/or something to munch on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note the addition:  Several of you said you can't be there until 3 PM.  That's fine.  With the overwhelming no. attending and some need to leave by then.  This might help to be able to fit in te place and also help me, who might have to come later too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is near Harvard Square.  Yo can take the Redline to the Harvard Sq. Stop or any bus that goes to Harvard Sq. (ie. 66, 77, 86, 1 and so on...go to MBTA.com and trip planning).  It is about a 2-3 minute walk from the Harvard Square Station, near Great Cuts and the Charles Hotel.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1160327580000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157997190000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coffee,Tea, and Conversation</name><id>5124612</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158429600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/5124612/</event_url></item>
