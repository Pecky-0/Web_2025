This will be a highly organized protest and we plan on rallying on the streets hopefully if the permit situation goes well. We will have mega-phones and amplifiers to show Boston that &amp;quot;when you are shopping/driving/doing whatever you are doing, BOMBS ARE DROPPING ON INNOCENT PEOPLE!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spread word! Invite your friends, allies, classmates, coworkers, neighbors, EVERYONE!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Israel ruthlessly tears into Gaza, slaying any and all in its genocidal path--including aid convoy and children--international pressure mounts to shut these atrocities down and let the people of Gaza live, which is already having a major effect on how the war is covered in the media, and--most importantly--on people's sense of need and confidence to fight back.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We've had a series of excellent mobilizations in Boston including rowdy protests, vigils and a large funeral march, dozens out to Saturday's national protest at the White House and more. We must come together to continue to build the movement with even bigger &amp;amp; stronger actions and events geared toward drawing into the movement the thousands in our area who are outraged at Israel's shear brutality and the US's support for it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For more info, email&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bostonstandswithgaza@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mark WeAreChangeBoston.org</member_name><member_id>4641561</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232314661000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232047648000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Protest at Israeli Embassy THIS friday 4:30</name><id>9531371</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232141400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/9531371/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/6/global_981894.jpeg</photo_url></item>
