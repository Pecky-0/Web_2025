<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come hear/see our own Kate Racculia read from her BRAND NEW NOVEL, &lt;i&gt;This Must Be the Place&lt;/i&gt;!!! We are very proud of her and will probably be heading out to celebrate (with or without our famous member) afterward for a drink or two to talk about how we all can become successful, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-order at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Must-Be-Place-Novel/dp/0805092307/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1277247832&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt; or support your local bookstore and buy that night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I'm sure Kate will sign the book for you and then it'll be worth millions. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll sit in the FRONT! With pom-poms! Okay no pom-poms.
