We can meet at 6:30 at the top of the big stairs near the ticket counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the website: &lt;br /&gt;

 This not to be missed movie theatre event will feature two of the most popular Next Generation episodes, Q Who? and The Measure of a Man which will include, for the very first time, about 13 minutes of never before seen additional content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This special event will also include exclusive looks at the extensive restoration taken to make Season 2 look better than ever before, never-before-seen interviews with the original cast members, a behind-the-scenes look at the artists who created the original FX elements and photography and a reunion with the original cast members, captured in December 2011, as they celebrate 25 years of this unforgettable series.&lt;/p&gt;
