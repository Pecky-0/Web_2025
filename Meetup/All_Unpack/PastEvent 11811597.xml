It's quite cute, where people are handed out paragraphs to read, either supporting the Patriots or Tories, discussing the stamp tax and tea taxes. Lots of elementary school kids trying to read the words aloud. It's a hoot! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking we could each pick up our Will Call tickets, then gather near the Coffee Bar at Borders across the street from 4:30 pm to 4:45 pm, then join the immense line forming in front of the Old South Meeting House. The doors open at 5:00 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Brown Paper Tickets email&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Purchased tickets will be available at the Old South Meeting House Museum Shop as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Friday, December 11: 10am-4 pm&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Saturday, December 12: 10 am-4pm &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;and Sunday, December 13: 10 am - 5 pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Tickets MUST be picked up at the Will Call table by 5 pm on the day of the event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ticketholders arriving after the 5:30 pm program start time will be admitted at the discretion of Old South Meeting House staff and may not be admitted if the event is already at capacity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;All seating is general admission.
