This season’s feature exhibit in the Woodman House is “QUENCH YOUR THIRST…&lt;em&gt;a history of Dover bottlers&lt;/em&gt;..” An opportunity to see examples of Dover milk bottles representing the local dairy farms, pharmacy bottles embossed with the names of local pharmacists, and soda bottlers like Robinson Brothers, Mission Beverage and the Dover Bottling Company. See a rare 1923 Christmas Coke bottle embossed Dover, N.H. and the whiskey bottlers like Rochester Bottling once located on Third Street in Dover, Durkin, Mallen &amp;amp; Loughlin and M.R. Kennedy…. even shot glasses from the Kimball Hotel and the Turf Cafe in the old Morrill Block. In addition…early examples of hand blown and machine made bottles from the collection of bottle archeologist Bram Hepburn, offers a historical view of early bottle making in New England. A seperate display offers the visitor a chance to see unique and unusal figural bottles that include early Saratoga Springs water bottles, cathedral style pepper sauce and bitters bottles, a three sided poison bottle and a sample of the large 1910 Carter’s ink bottled once used to fill the smaller ink wells in school desks. The wonderful shapes and colors will fascinate and educate all who visit this once in a lifetime exhibition. &lt;a href="http://woodmaninstitutemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PHARMACY-Sullivan-Littlefield-4x6-wht-bk_resize.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://woodmaninstitutemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PHARMACY-Sullivan-Littlefield-4x6-wht-bk_resize-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
