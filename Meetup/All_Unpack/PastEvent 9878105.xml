This is a good time to plant container-grown fruit and nut bearing shrubs. It's also a good time to plan for what you want to plant in the Fall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the loose agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:00- We'll meet and greet each other and start a discussion on Food Forests.&lt;br /&gt;1:15-  Go out to the muddy garden and observe soil strata in planting holes and talk about soil amendments for various plants.&lt;br /&gt;1:45- Plant a shrub or two and learn how to get them properly established in the hole.&lt;br /&gt;2:30- Walk about and discuss what might thrive in different locations: shady, damp, dry and small areas etc. We'll also observe what the Meadow is growing without any help from us.&lt;br /&gt;3:00- Wrap up and maybe take an herb home to plant! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please: &lt;br /&gt;Wear appropriate shoes- it's bound to be muddy in April.&lt;br /&gt;Bring a snack or beverage to share.&lt;br /&gt;Bring some questions specific to your place.&lt;br /&gt;Bring your kids- they usually love mud and plants!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal with the shovel</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed Falis</member_name><member_id>7312556</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241374260000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236170823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Food Forests in Celebration of Arbor Day</name><id>9878105</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240678800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/9878105/</event_url></item>
