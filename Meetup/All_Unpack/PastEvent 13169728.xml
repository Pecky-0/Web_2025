Register by contacting Michelle Magee 603-986-6142 or rosequartz1717@yahoo.com . Fee is $195, due by June 12. Please register early; space is limited. . Note from Judy: This training was formerly only given in India. We welcome this opportunity to host this weekend to undergo our own next level of healing and receive the initiation that will allow us to spread this blessing to other people. The blessing (also known as Deeksha) is given to others through a transmission of light and energy from your hands to the crown of someone’s head. It’s a beautiful thing, and is meant to help our evolution and awakening.
