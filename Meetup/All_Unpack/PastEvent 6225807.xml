However it is actually the correct term for the traditional Agricultural folk music originating from the Punjab region in the sub-continent of India. Traditional Bhangra has always played a major part in the life of the people, and forms an integral part of the fabric of the society. Though Bhangra has changed over time, it has always kept it's roots intact to the traditional forms of the dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tradition of Bhangra spread slowly to other parts of India and the world and developed into a unique folk dance form. Bhangra has come of age and is now performed at major celebrations and in many clubs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonbhangra.com/bbc/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonbhan...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information will be added as the event nears. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194904943000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-27</urlname><id>610218</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Group Closing - Indian Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187809772000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Bhangra Competition 2007</name><id>6225807</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194732000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-27/events/6225807/</event_url></item>
