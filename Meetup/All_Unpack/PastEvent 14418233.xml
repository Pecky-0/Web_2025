This is a gorgeous course (my favorite) and the 19th hole is very relaxing.  If anyone is intersted, please rsvp as soon as possible as they require a credit card and I'm going to try to assign the T times as first come first serve as the second T time has less of a chance of completing all 18.  Their first T time for this rate is actually at 4:20 but I'm hoping if we are all there and at the T by 4pm they'll let us out.  As of right now, they are wide open from 3:00pm right through.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>clubhouse or T at 3:50pm, driving range before that</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cindy</member_name><member_id>5281885</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287855014000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>golf-260</urlname><id>1127024</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2200012207</group_lon><name>The Boston and Beyond Golf Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281754046000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Granite Links, Sunday, 8/15</name><id>14418233</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281902400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/golf-260/events/14418233/</event_url></item>
