Using evocative maps and 3-D computer simulations, Lukez illustrates the ways in which incremental corrections of past development patterns can lead to a new type of community--one with a stronger and more balanced relationship with the landscape and a unique identity rooted in both its history and emerging needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lukez is the author of the newly published &lt;i&gt;Suburban Transformations&lt;/i&gt; and is the founding principal of Paul Lukez Architecture in Somerville. A graduate of and now educator at MIT, Lukez has received several significant awards for his research on issues such as new housing types, the transformation of Boston's Central Artery, and community planning and advocacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's mix and mingle afterwards, too. For those of you who might be thirsty, meet up by the entrance after the lecture is over. I suggest we head over to &lt;a href="http://www.solasboston.com/solasboston/" target="_blank"&gt;Solas&lt;/a&gt;, a nearby bar (170 Boylston).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To subscribe to YPNet's monthly e-newsletter, which provides a wide range of architecture and design competitions, exhibits, mixers, and opportunities around Boston, click &lt;a href="http://www.architects.org/news/signup.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the signs by the exit.
