<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our next conscious movie meet up will be on Friday July 25th with the movie Rabbit proof fence:&lt;br /&gt;This is the true story of Molly Craig, a young black Australian girl who leads her younger sister and cousin in an escape from an official government camp, set up as part of an official government policy to train them as domestic workers and integrate them into white society. With grit and determination Molly guides the girls on an epic journey, one step ahead of the authorities, over 1,500 miles of Australia's outback in search of the rabbit-proof fence that bisects the continent and will lead them home. Their only resources, hope, tenacity, determination, ingenuity and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you for this movie&lt;br /&gt;Christine&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just come through the front door of the Center of Light.
