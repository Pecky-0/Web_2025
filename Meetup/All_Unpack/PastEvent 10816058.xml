His paintings evoke the type of order and chaos found in patterns of natureâ€”branching, veining of leaves, and molecular systems. This exhibition of 25 recent works by Lynch will pair his large painted canvases with smaller sections of each of his paintings.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267402418000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246916623000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Museum of Art</name><id>10816058</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267228800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Out-and-About-Group/events/10816058/</event_url></item>
