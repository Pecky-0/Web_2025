This is a unique opportunity to hear part of the generally untaught history of the United States from a man who has devoted himself to the study of this topic for almost 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a friend or two (or many!) You will want to discuss this with someone during the drive home!&lt;br /&gt;As always organic snacks will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;ALL ARE WELCOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;THIS LECTURE IS FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Perloff will be selling autographed copies of his book and donations would be happily accepted to defray the cost of this special event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A recent review at Amazon.com of Shadows of Power:&lt;/b&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;5.0 out of 5 stars &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;b&gt;All I want to say is that if you liked the book, you must hear James Perloff in person. He is a wealth of information and full of integrity. To top it off, he is wonderfully entertaining. He must be, after all the revelations he still had us smiling and laughing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachael McIntosh</member_name><member_id>5611356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271284646000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FreedomIsFundamental</urlname><id>1191429</id><group_lat>41.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>FREEDOM IS FUNDAMENTAL Book Club and Discussion Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265592275000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE lecture by Author James Perloff</name><id>12546903</id><headcount>38</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271111400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FreedomIsFundamental/events/12546903/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/6/global_12992374.jpeg</photo_url></item>
