 &lt;br /&gt;

 Welcome to the ongoing series "new release night at Dan's", where ideally I will schedule the Meetup for the actual home video release date, or as close to that as possible dependent on when I am free.   &lt;span&gt;It is my hope that this will be your next best (and soonest) option to seeing the movie at your local megaplex during its theatrical run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Millbury - just off routes 146, 90, and 20 - and will disclose the address and my contact info in a private email to the members who sign up. ***EARLY START TIME*** due to length of movie. Please plan on arriving about 6:30 to get settled and chat a bit, and the movie starts at 7:00 sharp.  No early birds, please :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to bring munchies and/or beverages for yourself and/or others, but please do not feel obligated to do so.  The assumption should be that people will have eaten a proper meal before they come over, and if that's not the case then by all means bring whatever.  I will make it a point to always make fresh popcorn for these movie nights, but really I expect nothing in return besides a good time had by all.  I'll have unlimited Brita-filtered water, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all 6 slots are taken up, I recommend jumping on the waiting list and marking your calendars, since we all know plans change for people and folks may back out last minute.  Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan</member_name><member_id>41397892</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365043314000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356475030000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Release movie night at Dan's: Lincoln</name><id>96493532</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365028200000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/96493532/</event_url></item>
