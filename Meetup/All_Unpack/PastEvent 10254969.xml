Although we do talk business at them for maybe half an hour and sometimes play evidence clips, these things are so y'all can hear first hand what we do, ask questions, tell your own stories, etc.  They're so we can all have a little no-pressure time together, and it kinda helps us all by reminding each other that this stuff *isn't* just TV and book fodder, but real events happening to real people - like us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Asia has a decent buffet going til 8:00 - $12 per person - or choose something from their most excellent menu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See y'all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the person who resembles my profile image, but ask at the entry anyhow!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243814651000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240529998000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group May Meetup</name><id>10254969</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243549800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/10254969/</event_url></item>
