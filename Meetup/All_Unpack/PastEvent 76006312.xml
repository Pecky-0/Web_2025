&lt;p&gt;Due to possible rain this Sunday, I've added a Saturday Mount Willard hike.  Sunday's Mount Willard hike will still occur, too.  We'll gather for the hike at the "Crawford Notch Depot Macomber Family Information Center" sign at Mount Willey. Feel free to park at the AMC Highland Center if the small parking lot at the Crawford Notch Depot is filled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave extra time to get through the North Conway traffic, and try to arrive at 10:30 a.m. Also, make sure that you &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;DON'T STOP&lt;/span&gt; at Mount Willey/Mt. Webster/The Willey House Snack Bar and Country Gift Shop. Drive approximately 3.5 miles past Mount Willey, and &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;DO STOP&lt;/span&gt; AT Mount Willard / Crawford Notch Depot / Appalachian Mountain Club's Highland Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appalachian Mountain Club says that "probably no other spot in the White Mountains affords so grand a view as Mt. Willard for so little effort."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relatively easy hike to Mount Willard rewards you with close-up views of Crawford Notch, rounded out with views of many more mountains farther in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hike Mount Willard, 4 miles, 1100 elevation gain, 3 hour hike, bring a camera, water and snack to enjoy at the summit.  The summit of Mount Willard is 2,800 feet and the view from the summit is impressive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
