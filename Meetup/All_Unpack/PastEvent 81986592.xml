I've missed hosting these and decided it was definitely time to bring it back ! It's a LOT of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meetup at 6:45 , get a table(s), have drinks , appetizers, or dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the amount of RSVP, we will need to form teams as Trivia begins at 8:00 pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be a Brainiac to play this game. But, f you aren't up for playing, join us anyway ! You can be there to cheer us on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if they still offer a cash prize, but will inquire.&lt;/p&gt;
