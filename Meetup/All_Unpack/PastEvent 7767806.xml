Today, teleportation and invisibility seem equally far-fetched. Renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores how mind reading, the routine use of force fields, and other feats that are currently science fiction may become commonplace tomorrow. Book signing to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is part of the second annual Cambridge Science Festival, the first and only full-scale celebration of science and technology in the United States.
