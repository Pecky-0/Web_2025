<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have as many cars coming as can fit.  See event details for car pooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is warm.  Let’s go see some water falling.  The Meshomasic State Forest is the oldest state forest in New England.  We will follow the Shenipsit Trail for a short distance and see a little cascade.  Depending on how much water is flowing, there is a babbling brook and water descending a large outcropping of bedrock.  We are hoping for some rain in the days before the walk to give the brook some water, but not so much as to make the trail impassable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parking is very limited at the trail head.  Only 4 or 5 cars can be squeezed in there, with everyone leaving at the same time.  That is if no one else is parking there at the same time.  Car pooling is necessary.  I am limiting the attendance to limit the number of cars arriving.  Those who are driving, RSVP Yes and tell where you are picking up passengers.  Those who can ride with someone else, email those who RSVP'ed and see if you can ride with them.  We will see if this works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 1 mile with a few hills.  There are stream crossings on rocks.  There are muddy areas we will be crossing.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 1 and a half hours.  The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  We will be parking on a forest road called Woodchopper Rd.  Only the northern part of it is shown on the electronic maps.  Approximate address of the southern entrance, (no mailbox there) 180 Clark Hill Rd, East Hampton, CT.  There is no road sign posted.  Follow the one lane dirt road about 0.5 mile to the trail crossing.  Look for the blue blazes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=180+Clark+Hill+Road,+East+Hampton,+CT&amp;amp;sll=41.587266,-72.536759&amp;amp;sspn=0.004943,0.008905&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=180+Clark+Hill+Rd,+East+Hampton,+Middlesex,+Connecticut+06424&amp;amp;ll=41.58733,-72.540665&amp;amp;spn=0.009886,0.034161&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279487449000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275259682000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meshomasic State Forest - Shenipsit Trail Walk, East Hampton, CT</name><id>13641852</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279474200000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/13641852/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
