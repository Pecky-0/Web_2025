Nonetheless, at an elevation of 692 feet it is still the highest point for miles around and offers great views of the White Mountains and ocean! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike up the mountain is short - a half hour or less - and from there, we’ll head across the street for more easy to moderate level hiking over wooded terrain. Trail is easy to - at times - moderately sloped. There are occasional wet and slippery (from moisture; ice is gone!) spots, so wear the appropriate footwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ll time the hike to last about 2 ½ hours or so, and from there we’ll head to Mike’s Clam Shack (which is not a clam shack at all) but rather a very popular moderately-priced family restaurant located in Wells (www.mikesclamshack.com) for a great meal and coffee! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll look forward to meeting all of you then! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are easy:&lt;br /&gt;Route 95 north over the big bridge to Exit 7 just before the toll booths. Go to the end of the ramp - stop sign - take left - and then next immediate right (the road ends at that point, so you have to turn right), and go approximately 6.3 miles (the name of this road is Chases Pond Road which becomes Mountain Road - same road; just keep going straight). You will come to a small parking lot at the base of Mount Agamenticus (the paved road ends at this point) - and you can park either in the lot, or if it is full like it often is, on either side of the road.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting near a Silver Subaru Forester in the general vicinity of the above referenced meeting spot.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy</member_name><member_id>10613717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1270491558000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268493730000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike / Dinner Social in York Area</name><id>12866202</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270314000000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/12866202/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/3/global_7735123.jpeg</photo_url></item>
