It stars Toshir&amp;#333; Mifune, Masayuki Mori, Machiko Ky&amp;#333; and Takashi Shimura. The film is based on two stories by Ry&amp;#363;nosuke Akutagawa — (&amp;quot;Rashomon&amp;quot; provides the setting, while &amp;quot;In a Grove&amp;quot; provides the characters and plot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Rashomon can be said to have introduced Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to Western audiences, and is considered one of his masterpieces. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and also received an Academy Honorary Award at the 24th Academy Awards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The film depicts the rape of a woman and the apparent murder of her samurai husband through the widely differing accounts of four witnesses, including the rapist and, through a medium (Fumiko Honma), the dead man. The stories are mutually contradictory, leaving the viewer to determine which, if any, is the truth. The story unfolds in flashback as the four characters—the bandit Taj&amp;#333;maru (Toshir&amp;#333; Mifune), the samurai's wife (Machiko Ky&amp;#333;), the murdered samurai (Masayuki Mori), and the nameless woodcutter (Takashi Shimura)—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) to a ribald commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse identified by a sign as Rash&amp;#333;mon&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Come, let us get confused together, then try to sort it all out over beer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care to grab a bite to eat beforehand? T.J. Maher will be at food court at the lower level of The Garage near Flat Patties starting at 5:45 pm. We can walk over to the Harvard Film Archive at 6:30 pm to grab seats. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Akira Kurosawa:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Kurosawa had a distinctive cinematic technique, which he had developed by the 1950s. He liked using telephoto lenses for the way they flattened the frame. He believed that placing cameras farther away from his actors produced better performances as they would not be conscious of the camera. He also liked using multiple cameras, which allowed him to shoot an action scene from different angles. As with the use of telephoto lenses, the multiple-camera technique also prevented Kurosawa's actors from 'figuring out which one is shooting him [and invariably turning] one-third to halfway in its direction.&amp;quot; Another Kurosawa trademark was the use of weather elements to heighten mood; for example, the heavy rain in the opening scene of Rashomon and the final battle in Seven Samurai (1954); the intense heat in Stray Dog; the cold wind in Yojimbo (1961); the snow in Ikiru (1952); and the fog in Throne of Blood (1957). Kurosawa also liked using frame wipes, sometimes cleverly hidden by motion within the frame, as a transition device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;He was known as 'Tenno', literally 'Emperor', for his dictatorial directing style. He was a perfectionist who spent enormous amounts of time and effort to achieve the desired visual effects. For the rainstorm scenes in Rashomon, because the falling water (provided by fire trucks) did not show up on film against the sky, he dyed the water black with calligraphy ink in order to achieve the effect of heavy rain. In the final scene of Throne of Blood, in which Mifune is shot by arrows, Kurosawa used real arrows shot by expert archers from a short range, landing within centimetres of Mifune's body. In Ran (1985), an entire castle set was constructed on the slopes of Mt. Fuji only to be burned to the ground in a climactic scene&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Harvard Film Archive is located in the lower level of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at 24 Quincy Street, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We are east of the Harvard Square Red Line T Stop, in between the Harvard Faculty Club and the Fogg Art Museum, one block north of Massachusetts Avenue between Broadway and Harvard Streets in the Harvard University campus&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Although parking in Cambridge is difficult (most of the surrounding streets have restricted parking for Cambridge residents only), metered parking on Broadway and Harvard Streets, as well as the rest of Harvard Square, is free after 6 pm. Film-goers are encouraged to use public transportation, particularly the MBTA Red Line&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
