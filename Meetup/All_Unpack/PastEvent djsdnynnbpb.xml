The venue has great signature cocktails and a really nice, elegant atmosphere that make it easy to relax and connect. It also has a terrific Monday special (which was taken advantage of by many): 6 Asian-style dumplings (called &amp;quot;momos&amp;quot;) and a cocktail for only $10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While parking can be a bit challenging in Harvard Square, it's very easy to get to via the Red Line or by bus from various areas outside the city, including Arlington, Watertown and most of Somerville/Cambridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Downtown Women's Club:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.downtownwomensclub.com" target="_blank"&gt;Downtown Women's Club&lt;/a&gt; is a business network and career website that makes professional networking affordable, effective and fun!
