We currently have 38 members consisting of models, makeup artist, photographers, stylist and designers and fashion writers. &lt;br /&gt;Our first meeting and shoot was on January 24th at Positive Image studio. Since it was the first meeting we spent about 2 hours talking and defining our mission then we had a shoot with models Hui and Jo-Jo. The models wore their own clothes and did their own makeup. During the first meeting we decided that the format for this group would be a photo shoot about every month with one person volunteering as the creative director for the shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second meeting/shoot was Feb 28th on location at a contemporary house. We spent a short amount of time talking and several hours shooting. This was a very well organized fashion shoot with excellent team effort. Clothes were provided by Designers: Olivia Chow, Elena Gorczyca and the Suneri Boutique. Models were Beata, Hui, and Lidia. Styling was by Olivia Chow and Olivia Kostigen.&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd shoot was at covershot studios in Lawrence.  There were about 10 shooters and 6 models.  Designers were Mary Colburn and Sherry Dwivedi.
