Let's meet after work, take a walk on the beach, and relax by the water. The smell of salt in the air does wonders to help you leave the workday behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at the picnic tables under the pine trees at West Beach. For those who haven't been here before - drive into Hammonassett, and bear right at the fork - there is a sign for West Beach. Park in the farthest lot on the left, and the pine trees will be in front of you. I will have a sign on a tree as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me with any questions. Dogs are welcome, but must be on a leash while on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246575448000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242913013000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Walk on Hammonassett</name><id>10461972</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243461600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/10461972/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/6/global_2047030.jpeg</photo_url></item>
