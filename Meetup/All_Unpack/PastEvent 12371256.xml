The father is Syrian-American and it is intense reading what happened to him in the aftermath of the storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to try a new location - Andala Cafe, also located near Central square. &lt;u&gt;www.andalacafe.com&lt;/u&gt; I have not had a chance to check it out personally but one of our esteemed members recommends it so let's try it. I believe it has two floors so we may not be immediately visible as you enter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they do not have a liquor license. I had hoped to at least have some of our meetings over a glass of wine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, if you have any questions or suggestions or feedback, please email me. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267411394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1481208</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263994359000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Zeitoun by D.
