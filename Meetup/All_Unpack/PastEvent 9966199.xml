The trip is an excursion into hidden jungle-like retreats that cannot be reached any other way. Here, you will float into a vast state-owned management area on one river, paddle across a shallow but wide pond, and then finish your trip on another river that snakes its way through dense vine-draped vegetation. There will be no doubt in your mind why this area is called Great Swamp. &amp;quot;(excerpt from Gorp). Most seasons there is one portage around a beaver dam. Sometimes the dam can be run, if you have the skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trip is not suitable for kayaks over 15 feet.  Narrow and twisty river. Paddle upstream against the current and then return with the current to the put-in. Beautiful paddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions. From Rt. 1 South or North take Rt. 138 heading WEST. Follow this to the intersection with Rt. 110. Right after this intersection on your LEFT is the put in. Watch for the sign. This can also be reached from Rt. 95 North or South. Take the exit for Rt. 138 and follow it EAST.
