Cash bar with hors d?oeuvres by Soul De Cuba.  Music performed by Waterfront Jazz Project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of you, your only obligation will be to have a cigar or a drink and relax (since most of my friends smoke and drink heavily in their free time anyways, it really goes without saying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  Smoking is legally permitted at Owl Shop in case it is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Liz F. 203 415.2066&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541152000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174054606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Owl Shop Party</name><id>5575343</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174780800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5575343/</event_url></item>
