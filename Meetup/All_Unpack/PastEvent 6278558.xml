<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>There are usually no less than 5 events going on across the state of NH where help is needed to distribute information regarding Ron Paul. Usually no more than two or three people are needed to attend each event, to man a booth. Other presidential candidates are usually represented as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of people attend these events which consist of fairs, old home days, and festivals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each weekend, these events offer us golden opportunities to talk up Ron Paul to people who actually approach us for more information on our candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can be available to be shipped out to one of these events, please RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and seek out your marching orders from Jane. We do not want to let these opportunities get away from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Aitken posts these event locations on her NH Liberty Calendar at the beginning of each week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhlibertyc.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhlibertyc...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please volunteer to help man these booths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For details, times and locations email Jane at &lt;br /&gt;themaclady@comcast.net&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542063000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188618888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RSVP for Help Needed!</name><id>6278558</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189864800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6278558/</event_url></item>
