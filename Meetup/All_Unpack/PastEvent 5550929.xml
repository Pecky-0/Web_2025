Lets meetup at the escalators near the front door by 5:25.   I will be wearing a badge so new people can find me.     It is opening weekend for this movie, although we are seeing an earlier show so it may not be an issue, I bought my ticket ahead of time, just in case.   I have been to meetups where some people couldn't get in....so be warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, I was thinking it would be fun to go to the Rock Bottom Brewery for munchies and drinks.   So if anyone is interested in that we can socialize a bit and talk about the movie.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need more information about the flick the official web site is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see a trailer go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/perfectstranger/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sonypictur...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177090424000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173402237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Perfect Stranger</name><id>5550929</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176586200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5550929/</event_url></item>
