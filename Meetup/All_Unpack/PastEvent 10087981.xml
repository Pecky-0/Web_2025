The 4 April march on Wall Street is the culmination of the &amp;quot;Yes We Can&amp;quot; campaign organized by &lt;a href="http://unitedforpeace.org/article.php?id=4027" target="_blank"&gt;United for Peace and Justice&lt;/a&gt;. On 3 April, the &lt;a href="http://www.bailoutpeople.org/april3-4.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Bail Out the People Movement&lt;/a&gt; will have its own mobilization while Wall Street is open for business. Both organizations are &lt;a href="http://www.bailoutpeople.org/apr3-4unity.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;supporting&lt;/a&gt; each other's actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special buses from Boston will leave both Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $30 for each day (with a voluntary $5 suggested donation to help subsidize those who cannot afford to pay the full cost). Buses will leave at 6:30 am from Roxbury Community College (Cedar St. at Center St., by the Roxbury Crossing T station on the Orange Line).
