<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join us for our monthly potluck fiesta! This month is a Salsa Party!  Iliana and other meetup members will teach the Salsa (in Spanish - mostly) to those of us who don't know it or need a review. Wear comfortable, light clothing as the venue is lightly air conditioned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This (mostly) Spanish conversation fiesta/dance party takes place at a private home near West Hartford center. Bring a SMALL amount of food to share. If you can, let us know in your RSVP what you'll bring. Meet new friends who share your interest in improving or maintaining language skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nos vemos!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Dworski</member_name><member_id>2589505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213916677000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211328426000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Spanish Language June Meeting</name><id>7978879</id><headcount>31</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213743600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/7978879/</event_url></item>
