Visitors will meet sheep, goats, alpacas and angora rabbits; observe sheep-herding demonstrations and sheep shearing; and visit with spinners, dyers, weavers, lace makers, rug hookers, knitters and over 40 other textile artisans. Visitors can also try weaving and spinning on their own in the hands-on tent. Related children’s activities will be ongoing. The Village’s famous chicken barbeque and buffet will be available in the North Shop and the Shaker Table restaurant will be serving Shaker-inspired meals for both lunch and dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>1774915</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540208000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-486</urlname><id>179362</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Concord Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1145918185000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canterbury Shaker Village Wool Day</name><id>4910079</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1159020000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-486/events/4910079/</event_url></item>
