This is an opportunity to help out with remodeling, construction, &amp;amp; in some cases landscaping projects for elderly &amp;amp; disabled people in our communities. Each HomeFront Day is car­ried out by thou­sands of vol­un­teers who rep­re­sent cor­por­ations, busi­nesses, faith-based organ­iza­tions &amp;amp; civic groups coming to­gether as a com­munity to assist neigh­bors in need. I've volunteered the past three years for this annual event &amp;amp; this year's AmeriCares HomeFront project will be on Saturday May 2nd, from 7:30 AM until 5:00 PM. &lt;b&gt;I will post the location of the event &amp;amp; info about the project &amp;amp; the needs that we want to fill as we get closer to the date.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be renovating 6 Enfield homes this year. Two homes are that of elderly widows; 4 others belong to single mothers with 2 of those with a handicapped child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee and donuts are provided in the morning. Lunch is also provided &amp;amp; snacks &amp;amp; cold drinks are available all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;House Co-Captains (in charge of work and site):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faustina Bianchi (860) 462-0834&lt;br /&gt;Rob Riley (860) 670-5173&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The team we will be joining is the one I've worked with the couple years (address is only team host's address/phone, not work location):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Patrick's HomeFront Team&lt;br /&gt;64 Pearl St.&lt;br /&gt;Enfield, CT 06082&lt;br /&gt;(860) 745-2411&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Marie Gallagher&lt;br /&gt;Volunteer Coordinator&lt;br /&gt;(860) 745-9556&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are starting work at 7:30 AM.

Please make sure to put your name on your tools so you get them back at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please know that if you cannot contribute the full day to this proejct, it is quite ok to come for part of the day&lt;/b&gt;...
