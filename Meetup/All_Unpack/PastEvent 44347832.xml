The house is located in Bridgton ME, about 40 miles west of Portland on Long Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our venture will take 3 to 3.5 hours each way, well worth the trip to enjoy tubing, skiing (cross country-or downhill), antique shops, dining, brewpubs, ice fishing,snowshoeing or hiking, outside firepit, beer pong, cribbage and MORE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accomodations are approximatly 13 people give or take - some air mattresses and most beds will sleep 2. Bring sleeping bags and or linens, and towels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$5.00 per head per night (house rules to help pay utilities ect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will carpool and circulate a food list to easily take care of meals. Those who have a decent size car or van and would like to drive, please let me know. Gas contributions for anyone who drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks to Len for his hospitality, this is going to be a great weekend!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>5999051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326854540000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Funseeker</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>nefunseekers</urlname><id>1277691</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Funseekers!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323805137000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend Trip to Maine!</name><id>44347832</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326484800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nefunseekers/events/44347832/</event_url></item>
