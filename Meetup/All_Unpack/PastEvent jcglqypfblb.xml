He eventually married and settled in a small town, leaving the nomadic life behind. But after the traumatic death of his wife, he vows to never play the accursed accordion again, and embarks on one last journey to return the instrument to its rightful owner. On the way, Ignacio is followed by Ferm&amp;Atilde;&amp;shy;n, a spirited teenager determined to become his apprentice. Tired of loneliness, Ignacio accepts the young man as his pupil and together they traverse the vast Colombian terrain, discovering the musical diversity of Caribbean culture. Hardened by a life of solitude, Ignacio tries to discourage Ferm&amp;Atilde;&amp;shy;n from following in his footsteps, but destiny has different plans for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be there</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299948642000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Kino Kafe is a bi-weekly showing of films from around the world.
