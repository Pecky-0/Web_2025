Dr. Karen Ferroni, a Kung Fu Black Belt, will be the instructor at this session.  She says &amp;quot;the paradox of self defense is that the more prepared you are, the less likely you are to need it.  When you can recognize and respond effectively to potentially dangerous situations, you are more confident in your every day activities.  You are also less likely to become a target of crime.  The class will help you feel more prepared should you find yourself in a threatening situation&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single Mingle Ladies I will always promote and post activities that help us develop our confidence, self esteem and growth as women.  Pre-registration is required by calling the Holyoke Medical Center Promotion Line at (413)534-2789.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288968347000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285031321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Women's Self Defense Class</name><id>14839674</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287443700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/14839674/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
