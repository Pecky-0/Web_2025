This is the easiest holiday gift exchange you will go to this year: there is NO SHOPPING involved! Simply find something that you received (or bought for yourself) that has not found its way into your wardrobe, home decor, or life, and wrap it up for our swap. Or "shop" from your business. The point is, we don't want to add to your holiday stress; we just want you to come out and have fun! Our December program will focus on networking within our group, so please come prepared with plenty of business cards to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; Members- $20 in advance (with $5 cash back at check-in), $20 at the door. Non-members- $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
