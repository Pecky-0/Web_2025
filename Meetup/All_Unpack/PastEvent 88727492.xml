I liked Gary's Hike which I was unfortunately unable to attend- so if I don't hear from anyone I will follow this one...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State park on Poole Rd. Hike the Parker trail over to the Cliff Walk Trail follow over to Bald Rock the across Amphitheatre tr. to White Arrow. &lt;br /&gt;

Return down the Pumpelli trail to the Red Dot to Cascade link to White Dot trail back to State park. We'll stop over at Inspiration Point, a little known spot with an exceptional view of Bald Rock. &lt;br /&gt;

This is not a beginners hike! Very steep sections lots of exposed ledges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

I will be in the parking lot at 9am, dark blue VW Beetle-&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane- Big D</member_name><member_id>11562832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351368167000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351291335000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Monadnock-Last Minute</name><id>88727492</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351342800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group/events/88727492/</event_url></item>
