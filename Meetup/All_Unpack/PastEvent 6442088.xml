But we have a very cool evening planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting at 7:00PM this evening so it is a little earlier than normal. We have a guest speaker coming in. Ron Rosenstock will be joining us to discuss the art of creating a photography book. Since the evening is all about books, we are meeting at the library in the Banx room. We only have the place till 9 so anyone who wants to join us at Caffe Dolce after the meeting is welcome too. there is an extra bonus to that after party too...We will have a lovely look at Beth Roberts Photo Show up at the cafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to see you all again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193607766000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>16</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190939578000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography October Meetup</name><id>6442088</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193353200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/6442088/</event_url></item>
