During the reign of the last dynasty in China, Qiu Jin boldly challenged traditional gender roles and demanded equal rights and opportunities for women. At a time when women’s lives were often marked by repressive practices such as footbinding, arranged marriages, and denial of education, she envisioned a future where women would free themselves from the confines of tradition and emerge as strong and active citizens of a new and modern nation. This documentary features Li Jing, a world renowned martial artist and stunt actor, as the lead actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on this film and the filmmakers, please visit www.autumn-gem.com.
