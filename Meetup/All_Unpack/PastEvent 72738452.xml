As the largest Sand Sculpting Festival on the East Coast, we are pleased to welcome world-renowned artists and over 500,000 spectators to our sandy shores. With new features including the interactive Kid’s Zone and Learning Center, and the hearty and healthy beachside food pavilion, the weekend is sure to be fun for the whole family! "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us this Saturday for the 9th annual National Sand Sculpting Festival @ Revere Beach. Let's meet at 2pm by the learning center (it should be next to the bandstand). We will check out the exhibits for a few hours, and if you want to stay for the fireworks later in the night, feel free to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available in the Wonderland MBTA lot and in the large lot adjacent to Wonderland Greyhound Park on Route 1A. The festival is also easily accessible via the Blue Line from Revere Beach Station.&lt;/p&gt;
