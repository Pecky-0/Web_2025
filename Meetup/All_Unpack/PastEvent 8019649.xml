On Fridays, our post-game gatherings are on the field, assuming the weather is decent.  Feel free to bring snacks to share with the group! If it's rainy, we'll head over to Davis. Before attending our events, please review our About Us page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, lanyards, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Please consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our Amazon Wishlist to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your optional donations are certainly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;Kelli and Dan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the big football stadium, tossing an illuminated Frisbee</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelli</member_name><member_id>4908325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212365014000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><why>There's nothing better to do on a Friday night</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211906344000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fantastic Friday Frisbee Fun</name><id>8019649</id><headcount>51</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212192000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/8019649/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/d/c/global_3460060.jpeg</photo_url></item>
