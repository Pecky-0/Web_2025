Most of the hike you follow a ridge line so you are able to look into the Connecticut River Valley, overlooking farms and small towns. Many times I have seen gliders or hawks take advantage of the natural thermals. We will meet inside the main entrance at the parking lot for lake Bray. total distance will be about 6 miles and will be at a moderate pace. Although this hike is in Western MA it is easy to get to, simple trip down Mass Pike (rt 90). For full directions check out: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/d.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;. Total time from Boston is just about 2 hours and 15min. Please bring water, snack, decent hiking shoes. weather (as of today) looks great on sunday, sunny and not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316437430000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316217380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Mt.
