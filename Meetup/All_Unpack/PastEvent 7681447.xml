The Sox will be playing LA on the big screen at 7:05 and we can play some games of our own as well if anyone wants to bring some along. Anyone up for a Scrabble Tournament, Boggle...Apples to Apples?  There is always pool and air hockey too. This is a great place to circulate and chat with each other too. Mark your calendars now. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet upstairs next to the bar...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209087962000</updated><rating><average>4.59000015259</average><count>17</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
