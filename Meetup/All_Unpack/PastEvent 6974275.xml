Description: A single mother living in inner city Chicago, Brenda has been struggling for years to make ends meet and keep her three kids off the street. But when she's laid off with no warning, she starts losing hope for the first time - until a letter arrives announcing the death of a father she's never met. Desperate for any kind of help, Brenda takes her family to Georgia for the funeral. But nothing could have prepared her for the Browns, her father's fun-loving, crass Southern clan. In a small-town world full of long afternoons and country fairs, Brenda struggles to get to know the family she never knew existed...and finds a brand new romance that just might change her life.

The story is adapted by Tyler Perry from his stage play "Meet the Browns." Perry will portray Madea and Uncle Joe in the film.

Notes: Please do not RSVP YES if you do not intend to come. Yes is not a MAYBE. If you can't figure out what your going to do in the future, please do not burden us with that. Please buy your tix AHEAD of time! I'm going to watch this regardless of people coming, but it will more fun with people.

It is auditorium #2 downstairs, I'll be right behind the corded rope after ticket stubs have been ripped in front of the popcorn counter. 

I hope they don't change the auditorium, but IF they do and it is upstairs, I'll try to grab one of the tables in front of the coffee house near the large monumental windows. It is currently DOWNstairs though in auditorium#2.

I'll be there @6:55PM. I plan to go into the cinema@7:10PM sharp. The movie begins@7:25PM.
