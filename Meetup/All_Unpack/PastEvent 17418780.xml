<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;It's time for the long awaited tennis lessons that have been in high demand!&amp;nbsp; This will be a one-night trial lesson at the South Shore Country Club in Hingham.&amp;nbsp; It is right near the Hingham commuter line so it is very easy to get to.&amp;nbsp; Once we try this out we can determine if we want to do more lessons.&amp;nbsp; The cost will only be $20 per hour with an additional $10 if you want to do an additional half hour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE ANSWER THE REQUIRED QUESTIONS THAT COME UP ONCE YOU REPLY TO THIS MEETUP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to do more lessons, there is a package deal for 4 lessons for $60 which is a great deal.&amp;nbsp; if you do decide to do this, you will be credited appropriately if you paid $20 for the first lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The club has their own rackets, and the instructor will determine what your skill level is within the first 10 minutes. He will match us up appropriately depending on your skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot go on this night, we may arrange lessons on the weekend depending on how the trial run goes.&amp;nbsp; Also, as we get more daylight we may change the lessons to 6:30 so that people can get there from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*When: Tuesday, May 3rd @ 6-7:00 or 7:30(depending how long you want to go)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Where: South Shore Country Club, Hingham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Why: Tennis is a fun and great form of exercise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Event Organizer(s): Chandra&lt;/p&gt;
