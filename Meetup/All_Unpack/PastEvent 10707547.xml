<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Samuel Goldwyn has finally debuted the official trailer for Cold Souls starring Paul Giamatti as Paul Giamatti. This quirky little comedy, reminiscent of Being John Malkovich in a way, is simply about soul removal. Paul Giamatti wants to remove his soul, so he does so at a new startup company in New York, but then they accidentally misplace it, and he goes to Russia in search of it. Unfortunately, I didn't think this story was as polished as a Charlie Kaufman story, but it's still wacky and fun, in a very cold way. You'll see what I mean in this trailer. Though I do have a desire to revisit this once it hits theaters in a few months.

Although I saw this at Sundance, I never reviewed it, so I'll send you to IONCinema: "This idea of trafficking souls goes beyond fiction, but the brilliance is how the filmmaker manages to normalize the absurd."

You will be meeting Jared at the beginning of the movie.  To find him, he will be wearing his sunglasses in his T-shirt collar.  See you there.
