It is clean, elegant, brand new, cozy, and the staff is angelic to us.&lt;br /&gt;A refreshing change from previous sites which were very helpful and accomodating but bigger and more institutional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Flower Kausel for volunteering to help me with the meets.  She is our new co-organizer, and the owner of Joswe, a beautiful Havanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell other small dog owners about our meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and let me know what you will bring re: food or beverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happiest of Holidays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small dog best,'Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask someone where I am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268235362000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260384686000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BOSTON MALTESE &amp; TINY DOG MEETUP  SUNDAY January 17th, 1pm - 5 pm., Holliston </name><id>12052970</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263751200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/12052970/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/c/global_83228.jpeg</photo_url></item>
