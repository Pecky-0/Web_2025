Charlie &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Jenny's own words....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I registered for the Dean Team Automotive MS Challenge Walk, I took on not one, but two significant challenges: to complete the rigorous event, and to raise money funding services and research for the fight against multiple sclerosis. At some point during the Dean Team MS Challenge Walk, my feet might ache or I might feel tired, but my thoughts will never be far from those who must every day fight the fatigue, immobility, and other symptoms of multiple sclerosis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why I'm asking you to support my fund raising efforts with a tax deductible donation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's faster and easier than ever to support this cause that's so important to me. Simply click on the link at the bottom of this message. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any amount, great or small, helps to make a difference in the lives of people with MS. I appreciate your support and look forward to letting you know how I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click here to visit my personal page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR?px=2261796&amp;amp;pg=personal&amp;amp;fr_id=3140&amp;amp;s_tafId=55462" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nationalms...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.
