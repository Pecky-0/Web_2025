<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Every Thursday night for the summer Bob Barnes (yes, our Wedeln Ski Coach) will run evening bikes rides starting at the Hopkinton Common.  Bob is a former pro-rider for Cannondale.  In May most rides will be about 20 miles, the plan is to increase the mileage throughout the summer.  Road bikes only! pace will be too fast for mountain bikes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find Bob just look for the guy with the bike at the Hopkington Common Gazebo.  Please be on-time, bring water, proper clothing and be ready for a good workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob does not check Meetup often so I have posted for him, I will not be able to make it most weekends.  I can pass messages on to Bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopkinton Common is located on Main Street (rt 125) near the corner of Hayden Rowe Street.  Take exit 21a from 495.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Bob will be at the Gazebo with his bike.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273792447000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272904278000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Road Bike Training</name><id>jxhpnynhbrb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273788000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/13368305/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/7/global_14726119.jpeg</photo_url></item>
