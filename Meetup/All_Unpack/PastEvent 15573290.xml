Sam Flynn, the tech-savvy 27-year-old son of Kevin Flynn, looks into his father's disappearance and finds himself pulled into the same world of fierce programs and gladiatorial games where his father has been living for 20 years. Along with Kevin's loyal confidant, father and son embark on a life-and-death journey across a visually-stunning cyber universe that has become far more advanced and exceedingly dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the graphics for this movie are supposed to quite impressive, I think it's worth a trip to the &lt;a href="http://www.jordans.com/imax.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;IMAX theater in Reading, MA&lt;/a&gt;. PLEASE NOTE THIS IS THE JORDAN&amp;quot;S THEATER IN READING. There is another Jordan's theater in MA, so I wanted to be clear :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to purchase tickets: &lt;a href="http://imaxtixs.easytixs.com/JordansReading/TicketingStartPage.aspx?634265356584052500" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://imaxtixs.easytixs.com/JordansReading/TicketingStartPage.aspx?634265356584052500" target="_blank"&gt;http://imaxtixs.easyt...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be waiting in the movie theater concession area (once you get inside the store you follow the signs to the theater) a half hour before the movie starts. I'll then transition to the line to get into the theater about 20 minutes before the movie starts. My picture is accurate- so look for me. I'm about 5 feet 6 inches tall- so if you're looking for me in line, I might not be visible from afar. I'll be keeping my eye out for anyone who signs up :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn</member_name><member_id>9373103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292890515000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290957891000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tron Legacy IMAX</name><id>15573290</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292803200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/15573290/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
