Jim and Vivian thoughtfully scheduled this meet, so that we don't have to wait so long for the next one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, we will do pot luck refreshments and food, so when you RSVP, let me know what you would like to bring, so we can plan to have what we need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have friends who have small dogs that would make good participants, feel free to invite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone where I am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240760944000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237170925000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Maltese Meet, March 29th, 2-4pm, Espec. for Pets, Sudbury</name><id>9962753</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238349600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/9962753/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/c/global_83228.jpeg</photo_url></item>
