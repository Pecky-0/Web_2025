&lt;p&gt;I am working with Mass. Eye and Ear to help recruit for their marathon team participating in the Boston Marathon this April. We are looking for great member to join the team. You will raise hope and a healthier future for people everywhere who suffer from debilitating conditions affecting sight, hearing, voice, balance, taste and smell, and cancers of the eye, head and neck. Members will have access to an exclusive marathon training program, race day amenities, and more. A minimum fundraising commitment is required. Find out more and apply at www.MassEyeAndEar.org/marathon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope some of you will consider joining!&lt;/p&gt;
