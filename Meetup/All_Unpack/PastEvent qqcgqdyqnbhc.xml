So if you couldn't make Mondays or you just can't get enough of us, you're in luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's your first time with the CT Rock Climbing Meetup or at City Climb, then it is completely FREE!! - We'll set you up with gear (if you don't have any) and you can climb with the group all night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your second visit, we recommend you take advantage of our Meetup special belay class. This will get you all set to climb in the gym whenever you want and allow you to belay for anyone else. It's only $35! Just post in the comments that you want to take the course and we'll be ready for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 If you're a returning a member, you can climb at the discounted rate of $12 for a day pass, and $5 for gear rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Meetup, we'll be heading out for food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Stoked!&lt;/p&gt;
