After 11:30AM on the weekends, they serve their incredible Polish cuisine with their full breakfast menu. Bigos, Golumkis, carrot slaw, borscht, peirogis.... they got it! Fun, historic atmosphere, and the restaurant owner, Donna, is a wonderful hostess!&amp;quot;  Eat-Up member, Pam Cargill.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brunch place also happens to be a favorite of Eat-Up organizers. So come down to Holyoke and join us for this meal.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 reserves your spot and gets you a taste of something Gramp's does best - Polish food.  But bring cash (or plan to use their ATM) as all attendees will be paying for their individual meals.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the back room.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287528878000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>food lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Western-Mass-Eat-Up</urlname><id>1464899</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western Mass Eat-Up!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281710480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gramp's in Holyoke - The best Polish food around!</name><id>14412125</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282494600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Western-Mass-Eat-Up/events/14412125/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/f/global_17148799.jpeg</photo_url></item>
