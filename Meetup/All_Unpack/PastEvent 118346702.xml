&lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard how the economic downturn has affected folks in our city. Sadly, the most vulnerable members of our society (e.g. our elders and children, people new to our country) are struggling more than most. Many can’t even afford the basic necessity of healthy and nutritional food. Thankfully, the Red Cross Food Pantry is changing that for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the week, the Red Cross staff diligently works planning, ordering, buying, sorting and stacking tons of food. We Boston Volunteers then get the honor of being the hands and hearts that distribute the food to the clients. And it is an honor when together we can help between 400 and 500 families get the food they so desperately need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bring your smiles and some good sensible shoes to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1033 Massachusetts Ave, Boston 02118*  &lt;br /&gt;

Saturday May 18th, 2012  &lt;br /&gt;

8:30AM – 12:00 Noon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

*While the Food Pantry shares the building with Liquor Land, Fastenal, and The Hen House (Soul Food!), the actual entrance is on Proctor Street and not Mass Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us at Boston Volunteers want to say “Thanks!” for sharing a little of your time to help our neighbors in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corey J. Sanderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

P.S. To ensure that we can make a maximum impact on Saturday, please make sure to change your RSVP ASAP if you are not able to attend. This way some of the good folks on the Waiting List can join our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. I will not able to be present and work along side you all this morning, so make sure to seek each other out and say hello!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Corey J Sanderson</member_name><member_id>19949541</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368958908000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Boston Volunteers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BigEnoughtoDeliver</urlname><id>1343564</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Volunteers.
