If you didn't receive it the first time here are the details for today: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its suppose to be close to 70 today.  A perfect day for hiking.  Lets meet at Lynn Woods and hike for about&lt;br /&gt;1-1.5 an hour at a moderate pace. Hiking boots and water are recommended.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll me at 2:30 in the parking lot (please not there are 2 parking lots - (you want the Pennybrook Rd lot)  and start hiking no later than 2:45.
