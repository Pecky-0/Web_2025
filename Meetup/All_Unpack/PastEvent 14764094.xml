<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Gene has kindly offered to lead the group this coming Sunday morning at Bare Cove. The RSVP is open until Saturday at 6pm, the walk will be cancelled if there isn't enough interest by that time. Bare Cove is a three and a half mile, easy walk on wide, flat trails. Bring along some water and a towel to clean off your wet dirty dogs. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entrance to Bare Cove is across from the Hingham commuter rail station. Drive all the way in past the buildings and ball fields until you see a parking lot and lots of dogs. Dogs should be leashed until inside the gate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Gene will be waiting inside the fire gate</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gene</member_name><member_id>10532829</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285124427000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284463112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sleepyheads Bare Cove Pack Walk</name><id>14764094</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284904800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/14764094/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/6/global_10816006.jpeg</photo_url></item>
