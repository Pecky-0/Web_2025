We've come a long way, baby! Since the video evidence is one of the only types of evidence remaining, scrutiny of it with a fine-toothed comb becomes one of the primary ways to determine that 9/11 was, in fact, an Inside Job!&lt;br /&gt;See: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36ReZixfiY" target="_blank"&gt;Cutter Charges in the North Tower of the World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;, by David Chandler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These videos should be useful for showing to newbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring your blank DVDs to the meeting&lt;/b&gt; and be sure to get a copy of whatever we see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short subjects&lt;/b&gt; - bring what you think others should see - we'll see what shorts we have time to view. We also have the capability to show You Tube and Google videos, so bring your links.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: &lt;b&gt;1st Tuesday-Nashua&lt;/b&gt;; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; 4th Tuesday- OPEN (we're looking for an organizer for a northern Merrimack Valley meeting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at or before 7:00 PM&lt;/b&gt;, since this meeting is on a tight schedule. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and the video will begin promptly at 7:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring healthy snacks and/or drinks&lt;/b&gt; for sharing, since some may have come to our meeting directly from work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contributing a box of your favorite tea is always a good idea to build an inventory of available beverages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking is in the lot right in front of the building&lt;/b&gt; and Balanced Health is the last office bay on the right. You'll see the Sunset Restaurant at the far left end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspaper&lt;/b&gt; - For an interesting paper which covers 9/11 Truth issues and other topics of concern, visit the &lt;a href="http://RockCreekFreePress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rock Creek Free Press&lt;/a&gt; out of Washington, D.C. and see &lt;a href="http://9-11.meetup.com/307/pages/Newspapers_and_Journals/"&gt;our meetup page for others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring your friends!&lt;/b&gt; - Forward our email announcements to others you think will be interested in this important topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Write to us at MerrimackValley911Truth@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt; with your suggestions for the next month.
