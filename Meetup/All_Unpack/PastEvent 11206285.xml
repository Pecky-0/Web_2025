Seems that some people have had it with books featuring Nazis, death, and kidnapping. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our September selection is &lt;b&gt;The Matchmaker of Perigord&lt;/b&gt; by Julia Stuart. Here's a brief book description: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barber Guillaume Ladoucette has always enjoyed great success in his tiny village in southwestern France, catering to the tonsorial needs of Amour-sur-Belle's thirty-three inhabitants. But times have changed. His customers have grown older—and balder. Suddenly there is no longer a call for Guillaume's particular services, and he is forced to make a drastic career change. Since love and companionship are necessary commodities at any age, he becomes Amour-sur-Belle's official matchmaker and intends to unite hearts as ably as he once cut hair. But alas, Guillaume is not nearly as accomplished an agent of amour, as the disastrous results of his initial attempts amply prove, especially when it comes to arranging his own romantic future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every reader who adored &lt;b&gt;Chocolat&lt;/b&gt;, Julia Stuart's &lt;b&gt;The Matchmaker of Périgord&lt;/b&gt; is a delectable, utterly enchanting, and sinfully satisfying delight.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can view past selections by this group here: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/1091.South_Shore_Readers" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the cafe area and place a copy of the book on the table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254869468000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251302883000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Readers: The Matchmaker of Perigord</name><id>11206285</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253466000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/11206285/</event_url></item>
