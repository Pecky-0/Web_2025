I talked with some other group members and they said they'd go. Feel free to cross-post, as I think that's how we got such a big group last time. For those of you who don't know the Ranch, there's lots of room to do different things, dancing, pool, two bars, and of course the bull :) They have the line dancing lessons that start promptly at 8, which are free with the cover (I believe it's $5). So if you're interested in learning, come early. If anyone wants to grab a bite to eat beforehand, they have a good food menu too. It's a fun place, and last time we stayed til close.&lt;/p&gt;
