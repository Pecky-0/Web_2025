<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We will be holding a yard sale to benefit the "Table" which is a part of Father Bill's organization.  It is located in Brockton.  Kathy Mullen helps to run this organization that feeds lunch to the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have things in your home that you no longer need we would love for you to donate them to the yard sale. Please ask your friends and family if they have unwanted items that they may wish to donate as well.  We will have a few trucks that can help get stuff to the yardsale which will be at held at Sheila Burgess's house in Randolph.  Sheila has a garage where we will eventually have a date when we can begin to drop stuff off there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;NEW DETAILS:  If you can, arrive at 7 am to help set up and finish pricing.  We will have coffee and donuts but feel free to bring whatever snacks you may want.  We will be cooking Hamburgers and hot dogs for lunch... as well as selling them for the yard sale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we can collect for the yard sale the more people the Table can feed!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAIN DATE IS SUNDAY APRIL 29TH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
