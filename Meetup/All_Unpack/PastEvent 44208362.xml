All I have is my extra 4x8 ron paul sign so I am using that. If anyone would like to join me I would love the back up :) If you have more RP signs that would help out too. Parking would be at my office at 36 Baboosic Lake Rd which is right down the street. If you're coming, be here for 145 and we can walk down. If you can only come later, do that too, you'll see us or me :) Hope to see some fellow patriots tomorrow, should be a nice day outside. My cell is 603-533-3577 if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323807458000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323710860000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MERRIMACK sign wave</name><id>44208362</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323802800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/44208362/</event_url></item>
