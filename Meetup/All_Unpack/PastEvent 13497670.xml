Over the summer, though, there are still a few theatres that remain active. So look for some Meetups scheduled by Ron at 2nd Story or maybe Theatre-by-the-Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To wrap up the main season, we're having an End-of-Season dinner at &lt;a href="http://www.joesamerican.com/index.cfm?pk=content&amp;amp;cd=LOCATION&amp;amp;pid=10245&amp;amp;cdid=10348" target="_blank"&gt;Joe's American Bar &amp;amp; Grill &lt;/a&gt;at Providence Place. Good, casual food and easy parking at the mall. We'll meet at 8 pm. Just ask at the hostess stand for the RI Theatre Group. Please do RSVP so I can get a head count and make a reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's short notice, I know, but hope you can make it. Everyone is welcome, even if you've never come out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, thanks to those of you who have paid the $7 annual membership fee to help cover the time and money I put into this group. If you haven't paid yet, please do so through our website. Click on Contribution on the left side of the page. It's much appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we don't see you Friday, hope you can make a play over the summer or see you in the fall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask at hostess stand for RI Theatre Group</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279930036000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274016875000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of Season Meetup - Dinner/Drinks</name><id>13497670</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276300800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/13497670/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/5/global_12093749.jpeg</photo_url></item>
