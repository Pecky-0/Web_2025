I'm away this week and haven't been able to get online. I may not be able to make it this weekend, but BK will and he'll be bringing the flags. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never joined us, we would love for you to stop by and play some football. We have fun first. All skill levels play with us each week and all are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Red Line - Get off at the Alewife station and follow the signs to Rindge Ave. They will lead you to the football field. It has stadium lights, is next to a field house, and is a turf field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222046291000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219430846000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT 3PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8599926</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219518000000</time><rsvp_limit>32</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8599926/</event_url></item>
