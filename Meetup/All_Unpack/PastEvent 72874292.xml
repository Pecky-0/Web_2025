&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the event page: Farmageddon is a documentary film that illustrates, in no&lt;/span&gt; uncertain terms, the all out assault on local farmers by big government and their partners in corporate agribusiness. YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE DOING TO INNOCENT FARMERS! &lt;br /&gt;
