There seems to be a lot of interest in Wednesday after work climbing, so let's give it a shot this week and see how it goes. Let's meet at 7:00 at Rock Spot. If you need to take a belay test you might want to arrive earlier so you'll be ready to climb with us. Remember to mention that you're with the meet-up group when you check in if you're not a member to get our special meet-up rate. $10 if you have you have your own gear, $15 including gear rental.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lu B</member_name><member_id>14448771</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324159893000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Rock-Climbers</urlname><id>1496386</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>South Shore Rock Climbers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323785255000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Climb at Rock Spot</name><id>44308792</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323907200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Rock-Climbers/events/44308792/</event_url></item>
