<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Okay everyone, here are the details for wine night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every couple should bring one bottle of wine ($20 and under) and an appetizer or dessert. I don't think any of us want to drink wine on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will be doing a blind tasting, so we will disguise your bottle and only label the type of wine it is (&lt;/span&gt;merlot or &lt;span&gt;zinfandel&lt;/span&gt;). This way if some people only like whites, they can stick with those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone has had a chance to taste what they wanted, we can pick a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One quick note. We do have a dog (chihuahua) named Bandit. He is very friendly. I just want to make sure that everyone is aware in case anyone has any allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachel</member_name><member_id>5221678</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364174255000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362418043000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wine Night</name><id>107545652</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364076000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/107545652/</event_url></item>
