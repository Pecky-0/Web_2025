Upon arriving in Bristol we will proceed to the Hope Dinner for victuals ranging from a complete breakfast/lunch to just a simple tea and muffin. The Hope is a “colorful” family run dinner with some unique characters working there. On the return trip, we will take a little tour thru Colt State Park. After arriving back in Warren, those of us on a carb high who feel the need to expel some excess energy, can continue on the bike path thru Barrington, Riverside and so on. The ride into Bristol and back is approximately 12-14 miles and totally on bike paths. I am an average speed rider, so all you stud muffins who feel the need for speed can meet up with us at the dinner, and those of you who are slower riders, just let me know and I will hang back with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deborah (a.k.a.
