The route I have in mind is 3 miles and passes by three beaches with one overlooking the Boston skyline. This will be more of a walk than a hike but there will be a couple of hills involved. It's a pretty good workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting, we will meet at the far end of the beach next to the Dockside Restaurant.  (We can go there afterwards if anyone is interested.) Directions will be forthcoming.  Dogs are certainly welcome but they will have to be on leash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy G&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244299377000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241893479000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Not too Intense Walk Through Nahant</name><id>10375197</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242486000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/10375197/</event_url></item>
