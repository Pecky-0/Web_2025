&lt;p&gt;For those who've never been, Science by the Pint is an event sponsored by an organization of Harvard graduate students called Science in the News.  In between their sleepless hours of hard work at Harvard Med School, they bring their cutting edge scientific research to the public in a fun and informal format.  The event goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main speaker gives a &lt;strong&gt;short&lt;/strong&gt; 5-10 minute talk (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a full length lecture) about their research, then answers general questions from the audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team of colleagues comes around to individual tables and spends one-on-one time answering questions over food and refreshments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A drawing is held for prizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Things officially start at 7:00, but arriving by 6:30 allows fellow nerds to find a place to sit together, order food and drinks, and be ready once things get going.  Doreen and John will be on vacation this week, but Doug has graciously volunteered to host the meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Since space is limited at this particular venue, there needs to be a limit of 50 RSVPs. Past events have filled up quickly, so signing up early is advised.  Also, please keep your RSVPs up to date so fellow nerds on the waiting list can have a chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Tavern in the Square is located on Mass Ave, just a short walk from the Porter Square Red Line stop.  But for those who prefer to drive, there is parking along the left side and in back of the building.  Also you can park on Mass Ave, if you can find a spot. The meters stop collecting quarters at 6:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;And of course, the parking police at the Porter Square Shopping Center never sleep, so don't park in their lot by Shaw's, Tags, etc., else your car will most likely be towed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Hope you can come....ask lots of questions to make up for us being gone.   Also post comments on how it went for us.  :)&lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
