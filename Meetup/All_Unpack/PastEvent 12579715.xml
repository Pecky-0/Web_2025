Crawford via the Davis Path Trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All participants must read, understand and agree to the waiver and liability as outlined on this website and below.  In addition, all attendees must be prepared for winter conditions and have the appropriate gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting at Davis Path Trailhead 44° 07' 08&amp;quot; 71° 21' 13&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;The path leaves US 302 on the west side of the Saco River at a &lt;br /&gt;paved parking lot near the Notchland Inn, 5.6 mi. south of the &lt;br /&gt;Willey House site in Crawford Notch State Park. &lt;br /&gt;entering wilderness area &lt;br /&gt;2.20 mi 2 hr 4 min +1915 ft on Davis Path &lt;br /&gt;2.20 mi 2 hr 4 min +1915 ft The Davis Path, completed by Nathaniel T. P. Davis in 1845, was &lt;br /&gt;the third (and longest) bridle path constructed to the summit of Mt. &lt;br /&gt;Washington. The sections leading up the dauntingly steep &lt;br /&gt;southern slopes of Mt. Crawford and Stairs Mountain give some &lt;br /&gt;idea of the magnitude of the task Davis performed in building a &lt;br /&gt;trail passable to horses along this ridge. The resolution that &lt;br /&gt;enabled Davis to push forward with this apparently hopeless task &lt;br /&gt;was the inspiration for the naming of Mt. Resolution. This trail is &lt;br /&gt;almost entirely within the Presidential Range–Dry River &lt;br /&gt;Wilderness. &lt;br /&gt;The path leaves US 302 on the west side of the Saco River at a &lt;br /&gt;paved parking lot near the Notchland Inn. &lt;br /&gt;It follows the bank of the river about 200 yd. upstream to the new &lt;br /&gt;suspension footbridge (Bemis Bridge). Beyond the east end of the &lt;br /&gt;bridge, the trail passes through private land, continuing straight &lt;br /&gt;east across an overgrown field near a camp, then turns left into a &lt;br /&gt;path along a power line and crosses a small brook. It then swings &lt;br /&gt;right and enters the woods and the WMNF, and soon joins and &lt;br /&gt;follows a logging road along the bed of a small brook (normally &lt;br /&gt;dry in summer). It crosses the brook bed at a point where there &lt;br /&gt;may be running water upstream, soon crosses a tributary, and &lt;br /&gt;begins to climb away from the main brook, shortly passing into the &lt;br /&gt;Presidential Range–Dry River Wilderness. It turns sharp right and &lt;br /&gt;soon enters the old, carefully graded bridle path and begins to &lt;br /&gt;ascend the steep ridge between Mt. Crawford and Mt. Hope by &lt;br /&gt;zigzags. Attaining the crest, the Davis Path follows this ridge &lt;br /&gt;north, rising over bare ledges with good outlooks, particularly to &lt;br /&gt;Mt. Carrigain and the Tripyramids. &lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Mt Crawford spur 44° 08' 02&amp;quot; 71° 19' 52&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;0.30 mi 15 min +196 ft on Mt Crawford spur &lt;br /&gt;2.50 mi 2 hr 19 min +2111 ft &lt;br /&gt;to Mt Crawford 44° 08' 12&amp;quot; 71° 19' 57&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;0.30 mi 15 min -196 ft on Mt Crawford spur &lt;br /&gt;2.80 mi 2 hr 34 min +1915 ft &lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Davis Path 44° 08' 02&amp;quot; 71° 19' 52&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;2.20 mi 2 hr 4 min -1915 ft on Davis Path &lt;br /&gt;5.00 mi 4 hr 38 min 0 ft The Davis Path follows this ridge south, descending over bare &lt;br /&gt;ledges with good outlooks, particularly to Mt. Carrigain and the &lt;br /&gt;Tripyramids. It then leaves the crest and soon enters the old, &lt;br /&gt;carefully graded bridle path and begins to descend the steep ridge &lt;br /&gt;between Mt. Crawford and Mt. Hope by zigzags. It then leaves the &lt;br /&gt;Presidential Range–Dry River Wilderness. It climbs toward the &lt;br /&gt;main brook, crosses a tributary and then crosses the brook bed at &lt;br /&gt;a point where there may be running water upstream. It then &lt;br /&gt;follows a logging road along the bed of a small brook (normally &lt;br /&gt;dry in summer). It swings left and leaves the WMNF and the &lt;br /&gt;woods. It crosses a small brook and then turns onto a path along &lt;br /&gt;a power line. It continues straight west across an overgrown field &lt;br /&gt;near a camp and into private land. It crosses the new suspension &lt;br /&gt;footbridge (Bemis Bridge) and follows the west side of the Saco &lt;br /&gt;River about 200 yd. downstream to the paved parking lot near the &lt;br /&gt;Notchland Inn on US 302. &lt;br /&gt;to Davis Path Trailhead 44° 07' 08&amp;quot; 71° 21' 13&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;The path leaves US 302 on the west side of the Saco River at a &lt;br /&gt;paved parking lot near the Notchland Inn, 5.6 mi. south of the &lt;br /&gt;Willey House site in Crawford Notch State Park. &lt;br /&gt;5.00 mi 4 hr 38 min 0 ft Totals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hiker Responsibility Code is a set of principles that all hikers can look to before they hit the trail. Similar to the Skier's Responsibility Code endorsed by the National Ski Areas Association, the Hiker Responsibility Code was created to help hikers become more self aware about their responsibility for their own safety every time they are on a hike. It also acknowledges the inherent danger of hiking in the backcountry, and encourages hikers to be better prepared every time they are on the trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiker Responsibility Code&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are responsible for yourself, so be prepared:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Risks and Disclaimers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you sign up for Meetup.com, all members of Meetup must agree to their Terms of Service . Section 5.2 specifically releases the Organizer and Assistant Organizers from any liability related to incidents that occur at Meetup gatherings. &lt;br /&gt;This is an online adult based group. You agreed when you joined Meetup that you were over the age of 18. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the NEHAAG is an adult group members and guests must be 18 years old to participated in an event. Guests over 18 are welcome, but must join Meetup and this group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only exception to this will be when an event is designated as &amp;quot;all ages welcome&amp;quot;. In these instances the parents and/or legal guardians are responsible for the care and supervision of their guests under the age of 18 years old. By signing-up for an &amp;quot;all ages welcome&amp;quot; event the member acknowledges and agrees that the Meetup and the NEHAAG terms apply to the guests as well. &lt;br /&gt;All members will complete their personal profiles on the website. These profiles verify your hiking history and helps us get to know who you are. The organizers can then advise you a hike is too hard, and for security we can help identify each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Waiver of Liability. &lt;br /&gt;The New England Hiking and Adventurer's Group (NEHAAG) is volunteer organization. &lt;br /&gt;NEHAAG is a group of persons who share a common interest in the pursuit of outdoor recreational activities. Members of this group individually agree to pursue outdoor recreational activities with other Members and their guests(Events/Meetups). Meetups are organized by other members who have volunteered to lead the event. While event organizers may possess specialized skills or training, neither NEHAAG nor its members represent that they have any specialized training or skills relating to the event, wilderness safety or first aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather plays a big factor in the mountains. &amp;quot;the summit will be there another day.&amp;quot; We may cancel or change an event due to weather conditions. It is up to the member to keep track of event cancellations, posted by the organizer.We can not guarantee what trail conditions will be, only to advise members to prepare for all conditions. Communicate with other members who are participating in that event. &lt;br /&gt;Outdoor sports are inherently dangerous and accidents will happen. It's a reality that if your miles or hours out on a trail, it might not easy to seek medical care right away. If you chose to explore, you do so knowing that there are risks. &lt;br /&gt;It is wise for everyone of us to have regular medical checkups and to be fit to hike. It should also be noted that if you have a &amp;quot;minor&amp;quot; medical condition that your hiking partner know of any special needs. Are you on blood thinners, diabetic, asthma, allergic to bees, etc? Remember that the most we can do for you in the woods is basic first aid, and try to get you to safety. &lt;br /&gt;By joining the group or participating in any events posted on the web page you are taking responsibility for your own safety and well-being. NEHAAG does not certify or confirm the identity or qualifications of any of its members to lead or participate in trips. Member personal information is voluntary. A minimum number of RSVP's will be met to insure the safety and comfort of all hikers and organizers. We remind all members that in an internet group it is difficult to verify anyone's reputation. Exercise common sense in meeting up with people you don't know. There is safety in a group. &lt;br /&gt;________________________________________ &lt;br /&gt;Be familiar with the hike plans- do your own homework. Here are some links to what you should know.
