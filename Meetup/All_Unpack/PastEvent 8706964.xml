<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>You are invited to join in a outdoor workday at Jamaica Plain Cohousing.  We need to do all kinds of yard work, tree work, mulching, weeding, composting (and extricating worms from the compost bins!), doing carpentry work, storing furniture, etc. etc.  Participating will help you see what living in cohousing is really like.  So put on some boots and a jacket and join us at any point between 1pm and 4pm.  Workers who stay till 4pm are invited to join in a shared meal afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS This being a workday, we will not include a tour (muddy boots, and all).  But we'll be happy to chat with you about life in cohousing while we push wheelbarrows and spread compost!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be working in the inner yard.
