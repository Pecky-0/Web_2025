The topic for this session will be focused on: What is a spiritual community; what are its benefits and how to find one.&lt;br /&gt; Researches done in the field exploring the spirit-mind-body connection have shown that when people are part of a spiritual community, their resiliency is increased. Practicing meditation is another factor in keeping a sense of peace even in challenging moments. This meet up will be an opportunity to meditate as well as learning and being with people desiring to grow in consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward seeing you and contact me if any questions,&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Christine&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot attend this meet up, but are interested in the topic, I will have a meditation meet up in Cambridge with the same topic.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ring the front bell</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251589043000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249350729000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August Meditation on the 27th:Topic: What is a spiritual community</name><id>11028517</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251415800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/11028517/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/8/global_1017208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
