Please bring any fun game you would like to play.  I have on hand &amp;quot;Apples to Apples&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Marry Date or Dump&amp;quot; and some other interesting games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house is really nice.  It's a great place to meet new people and talk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having a potluck so bring something interesting to share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be dancing to some fun music there also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions or gets lost you can call me at 603-312-6735.  I will have some tiki torches at the end of the driveway so just look for them if you get lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents' house is on the intersection of Lundy Lane and Hampshire Ave.  It is a long paved driveway.  Do not go down the dirt road called &amp;quot;Long Pond Road&amp;quot;  which is next to the paved driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please park on the side of Hampshire Ave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small donation would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286209007000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285290962000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>House party/Potluck</name><id>14877572</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286058600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/14877572/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/4/global_11336740.jpeg</photo_url></item>
