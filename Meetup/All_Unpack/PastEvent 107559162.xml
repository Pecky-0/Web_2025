This will be a chance for people to learn more about our program while enjoying some appetizers and the company of other like-minded individuals. We will briefly discuss what it means to volunteer for our Mentor Match Program; in this program, we match a caring adult with a young person with a disability. Matches meet for a minimum of 4 to 6 hours per month and keep in weekly contact through phone or email. The initial commitment is one year. The more people you bring, the more likely it will be that you win one of two $50 gift cards to Legal Sea Foods, so make sure to bring friends! Be sure to reflect the number of people you are bringing in your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaela </member_name><member_id>7143354</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363142039000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Boston Volunteers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BigEnoughtoDeliver</urlname><id>1343564</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Volunteers.
