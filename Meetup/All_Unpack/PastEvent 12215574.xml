There is a sign on route 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead is on the back right side of the parking lot if you are facing the mountain. There is a small trail on the left back side of the parking lot but this is not the trail for Mt Major. (Lat:43.50396 Lon:-71.29729)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be hiking up Mt. Major via the main trail.  This trail is 2.4 miles long one way and should take us approximately 1:30 to reach the summit.  Upon reaching the summit we can make a decision as a group on whether or not to take the Major/Straightback link over to Straightback mountain.  This would add approximately an additional 3 miles round trip to the hike.  Therefore total distance would be approximately 7.8 miles and should take approximately 6 hours to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Mt. Major offers some of the best views for a minimum smount of hiking.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a relatively low elevation mountain, expect to encounter cold weather conditions.  Dress appropriately!!  Snowshoes are generally not required, since this is a often used trail.  Foot traction devices are generally not required, but are strongly encouraged in case icey conditions are encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead: Parking lot is on the left hand side or Route 11 just 4.2 miles north of the town of Alton Bay.
