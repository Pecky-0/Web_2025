This is a good time to work on any project you have or start something new. It's never too early to get next year's Christmas cards made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

TIME: 1 PM - 7 PM (possibly later). Come and leave whenever you like. &lt;br /&gt;

WHAT TO BRING: Yourself, your art supplies and whatever project you’d like to work on. Bring your own beverage. Feel free to bring a snack to share—but that’s entirely optional. &lt;br /&gt;

COST: $10, regardless of how long you stay. Cash only, please. This fee helps keep ArtStudio 360 open, so we can't accept IOUs or partial payments; please plan to pay when you arrive. We're happy to direct you to a nearby ATM if you need it. &lt;br /&gt;

AMENITIES: Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.) and some supplies including acrylic paints, collage materials, embellishments, paper and more. Access to a microwave, toaster oven, refrigerator, kitchen sink and restroom. &lt;br /&gt;

WHO MAY ATTEND: Anyone (18+ only, please). Just RSVP through the NE ATC+ Meetup Group. Membership in the Meetup group is free; joining simply allows you to reserve a space in events at ArtStudio 360. &lt;br /&gt;

HOW TO SIGN UP: These smaller sessions often fill quickly. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly so that your space becomes available to someone else. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CANCELLATIONS: In the unlikely event that we need to cancel due to bad weather or other reasons---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356826284000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356214595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Studio Time in Holliston, Saturday — Dec.29th — 1PM-7PM</name><id>96276492</id><duration>21600000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356804000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/96276492/</event_url></item>
