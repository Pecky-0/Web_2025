Cash bar, pizza, and raffles will be available.  We'd like to reserve a premium-seating  table for our Boston Baby Boomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost per Ticket is : $28.00 - New Ticket Price - $22.00 floor seating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Yesterday I spoke to Mike from K of C and he gave me additional information.  The Hall will hold over 600 people and last year they filled up the place.  There is a large dance floor, thank you Billie for asking, and they expect people to dance and sing to Beatle's Music.  Couples and singles and all Baby Boomers should think about joining us.  We need to put up the PayPal for RSVP's since I need to get him our down payment.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Our table under BBB.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271023753000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267372556000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beatlejuice Friday Fundraiser - Melrose Knights of Columbus</name><id>12732412</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270850400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/12732412/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/c/global_7017868.jpeg</photo_url></item>
