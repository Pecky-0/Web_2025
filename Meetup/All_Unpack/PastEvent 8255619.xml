<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the newly formed &lt;br /&gt;Western MA PUG Meetup group!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you will be able to join us at our first meetup, in order to meet other pugs and pug parents and give our little ones time to play and socialize. This first meetup will be held at a private residence - the home of Milo (1 year old) and Binxy (6 years old). We have a large fenced-in backyard, so the pups can run around without worry. We'll have a puppy pool and any other cooling-off supplies, but please keep your pups' heat tolerance in mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do RSVP in order to get a sense of how many people and pugs we can expect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to meeting you and your pugs!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217859071000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners and Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernMApugs</urlname><id>1207399</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214937390000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Western MA August Pug Meetup</name><id>8255619</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217685600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernMApugs/events/8255619/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/1/global_4651329.jpeg</photo_url></item>
