General consensus is that everyone wants to eat at the concessions, so there will not be a potluck picnic at this event. Watch the calendar for a future event where we will have a potluck picnic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is supposed to be gorgeous for a day at the Willows, so grab your lawn chair, your hiking boots or your kayak...whatever gives you enjoyment and come on down.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab the Frisbee, wiffle ball bats and the beach chair and have a good time with new and old friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We believe that there is Kayaking but if you are interested in this, please call Salem Willows ahead of time for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salem Willows has Arcades and a variety of food concessions. Also when you RSVP for this meetup you will be asked if you would prefer to bring a potluck picnic lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children are welcome at this event. There is Free Admission and Free Parking at this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is weather permitting, raindate for this event will be the following day May 31, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are not able to find us call the Meetup Cell phone at 978-304-2811.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you at the park&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the picnic table with the Red baloon</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276299072000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272227550000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Day of Fun @ Salem Willows</name><id>13286424</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275237000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/13286424/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/a/global_14621354.jpeg</photo_url></item>
