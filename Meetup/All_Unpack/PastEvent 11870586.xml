A Friday night Sushi dinner at Singo Sushi in Waterbury!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/laughing.gif' border='0' alt='laughing' /&gt; You will drive to this place and be skeptical...it is a little TINY place on a stretch of the Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike that looks like it has never heard of wasabi.  I was having trouble finding the place, and I stopped literally in the set of shops right next door, and theydid not know of any sushi restaurant in the area......But, this little place gets great reviews.  It was closed when I drove by, but I went to the door and looked in.  It strikes me as a little gem.  It is a one room restaurant with about 5 tables and a sushi bar.  It looked immaculate.  There were bright colored menus.  There were signs about baseball teams coming for their season end parties.  I think it will be well worth trying.  I called and was told that they can accommodate us as long as we give them enough notice.  So I am going to ask for all RSVP's to be final by 11/19.  You can answer maybe before  that, but please put a definite yes of no by the 19th.  Thank you!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-33360208-singo-sushi-waterbury" target="_blank"&gt;http://local.yahoo.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/singo-sushi-waterbury" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this one has a link to the menu: &lt;a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/48/1470236/restaurant/Hartford/Singos-Sushi-Rockin-Sushi-Waterbury" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.urbanspoon...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, there is a place I love to go called Jitters Cafe and Coffee House in Southington.  Friday 11/20 is their comedy night.  It is a great night to go there...there is live music and love comedy.  The coffee and desserts are fabulous, and it is only a few exits away from Singo.  If people want to, we can head there after dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jittersclub.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jittersclu...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jittersclub.com/Calendar.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jittersclu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the short notice, but I hope some of you can come!&lt;br /&gt;-Kelly&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelly S</member_name><member_id>2538500</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258935369000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258164634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fun Friday at Singo Sushi.
