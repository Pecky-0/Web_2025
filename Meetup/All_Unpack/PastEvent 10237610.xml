<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's a casual monthly gathering.  Come anytime for dinner, a drink, or just for the conversation.  There's no agenda, so come whenever you can make it and don't worry about arriving later than 6:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We always try to meet in the back by the TV and fireplace.  There are more tables to move around back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;Don't be discouraged by the small number of RSVPs on this site; we usually have 20-30 attendees!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetups are very informal and generally there is no agenda. At 7:00 PM during the upcoming meetup, there will be an opportunity for attendees to share brief announcements. If you have something to share about a campaign, an event, a website, an organization, hereâ€™s your chance to tell the group. A sign-up sheet for announcements will be available from 6:00-7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  This meetup event is cross-posted at the Boston Republican Party Meetup Group and on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk to the back section near the fireplace &amp; TV.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>4385831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245186429000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>(young) Republicans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>youngrepublicans-43</urlname><id>170358</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston (Young) Republicans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240355815000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Young Republicans May Meetup</name><id>10237610</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242770400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/youngrepublicans-43/events/10237610/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/1/global_7646817.jpeg</photo_url></item>
