&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Monday Night Meetup series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Mile and A Quarter!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this location is where the old Barnsiders "used to be", but really that's been gone so long I don't think it really counts, but let's just mention it for old times sake. If you've been paying attention to the S Water Street area, you might have noticed that they've been preparing to open for a few months now......at long last, the time is here and they opened last week!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I popped in the other night to check it out and wow - it seems like aÂ  great new addition to neighborhood! The bar and lounge area are spacious and comfortable, the drink selection is great and the food looks good too. With a decor of warm, neutral contemporary leather and dark wood, the bar/lounge area in the front of the restaurant is perfect for a casual cocktail after work and for a nice dinner, the more intimate dining room over looking the river is perfect. They even have a small bar in the dining are for those interested in a little quieter setting then the lounge. Overall, I was very impressed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here we go on our first NEW RESTAURANT ALERT Monday Night Meetup, and let's check it out!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
