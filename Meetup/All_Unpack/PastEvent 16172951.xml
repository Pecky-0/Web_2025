You may have trekked through the mournlands and fought a red worm, you may have dealt with a kraken after surviving an airship crash, you may have escaped a burning tower by kicking out the windows and rappelling down it while catching your falling comrades and keeping a rescued hostage alive, but what lies ahead is something else entirely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This adventure is special, it is being held at Templecon 2011 in the Warwick Crowne Plaza Hotel. Templecon is not free, you will have to pay to get in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This adventure is open to anyone, even if you have not played in any of the previous episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Characters are now level 10. You are allowed one level 11 magic item, one level 10 magic item, and one level 9 magic item from the allowed books. You also have 4200 gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Please note that signing up here will hold your spot at Templecon until Sunday, February 6th, 9:15am. At that point anyone who has not shown up or is not ready to play will forfeit their spot to anyone who is present and ready to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the ONLY source material allowed to be used are the PHB, PHB 2, PHB 3, the Eberron Players Guide and Adventurer's Vault 1, be sure to check the errata for all books here. You must take all races, classes, feats, and magic item choices from those books ONLY. This campaign will be cheddar-light. If you are looking for a min/max meat grinder, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Players will treat everyone with respect and remember that the object of the game is for everyone to have fun, not just one person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Capping the group at 6 players, will run a second group if needed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>11219434</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297005343000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295919488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D 4th Edition 10th Level Templecon Eberron Campaign Finale</name><id>16172951</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297000800000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/16172951/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
