If you don't have any plans, come join us for a tour of Mission Hill.  Learn some history and get a little vitamin D.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour starts promptly at 11:00am, so show up early to get organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover one of the least explored neighborhoods within Boston. Mission Hill was once an area of Rocksberry and divided among several large landowners but slowly developed into a dense urban area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formally called Parker Hill, the arrival of the Redemptorist Fathers who set up a small mission church changed the name of the area to Mission Hill. The mission expanded as it catered to German and Irish immigrants who worked in the breweries along the Stony Brook and constructed the basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. You may have seen it in the news last year, as it was the location of Sen. Edward Kennedy's funeral mass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also see the remains of two Roxbury Puddingstone quarries, an architectural gem of a library designed by Ralph Adams Cram, the former home of Mayor Maurice J. Tobin, and a former tuberculosis sanatorium whose motto was &amp;quot;nothing over us but heaven.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walking tour winds up Mission Hill and ends at the top with sweeping views over Boston and the Boston Harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet outside the Roxbury Crossing T Station on the Orange Line. The tour is $15 for the general public and $5 for card-carrying BBF members and docents.
