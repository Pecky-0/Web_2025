People tell me that they offer a deal on food after work, so let's check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no group tab because people come and go at various times, so a group tab does not work out well.  Please maintain your own tab or pay as you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be in the bar area wearing a red sweater and possibly a lei.  Wear something red, so that people can find us.  Look for the crowd of people wearing red.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'd thought I'd say green, huh?  Ha!  New year - New color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear a red sweater and possibly a red lei.
