<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hop River Rail Trail Walk, Vernon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:  Sunday Mar 22, 1:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come walk on an old railroad bed.  This has been converted into a walking trail, as many have been in the country.  The line used to carry passengers and freight from Manchester to Willimantic.  The starting point is the historic location of the Vernon station, with connections to Rockville by trolley.  There was also a turntable to turn the engines around for the trip back to Hartford.  We will look at the construction needed to build the railroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy and flat walk.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 to 3 hours.  Rain cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  We will meet at the parking lot on Church Street.  The parking area is small, so you may have to park along the street.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Vernon+Rockville&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=%5B1-99%5D+Church+St&amp;amp;zipcode=06066&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.8219&amp;amp;longitude=-72.48145&amp;amp;geocode=STREET#a/maps/m::12:41.821577:-72.479944:0:::::/e" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk is being lead by Larry.
