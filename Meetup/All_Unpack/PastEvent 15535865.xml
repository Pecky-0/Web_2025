I have company coming, but may sneak out after for a dance, if I can get in by then. &lt;br /&gt;It's Pam K.'s birthday (she's in the pic), and she would looooove some company for it...sorry, I can't committ Pam, as I don't know what time my company will be leaving, and I just can't shoo them out the door...lol. But I do need to get out and dance BAD!!! &lt;br /&gt;put in your reply, if you'll be going for dinner at 7-7:30, the earlier you arrive the better, as this band really rocks the house. &lt;br /&gt;hope to see you all soon...susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>hopefully, someone will bring a meetup sign...lol</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290734795000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290521664000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Souled Out Show Band!</name><id>15535865</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290643200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15535865/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/6/global_19836694.jpeg</photo_url></item>
