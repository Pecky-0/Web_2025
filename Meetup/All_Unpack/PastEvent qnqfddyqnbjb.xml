Hope High School</name><city>Providence</city><id>1271740</id><country>us</country><lon>-71.401992</lon></venue><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Come play tennis with Raghav, John and several other collective members on Saturday Mornings at the Hope High School tennis courts.  We usually start playing sometime between 8 and 8:30, and depending on how many people show up (or show up late) we play until 10 or 11.  After some of us go to the Lippet Park Farmers market, and sometimes eat breakfast/brunch at a restaurant around the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tennis players of many levels, so come out if you are at all interested.  You don't have to show up at 8.  If you show up between 8 and 10 AM, we will likely be there.  (or have posted in the comments, why we are not there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  The Hope High courts are right next to Hope High's soccer field, and we've been thinking of playing some quick pickup games here with whoever is around.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the tennis courts behind the Moses Brown Physical Plant building.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8642703</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raghav</member_name><member_id>8758485</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349545593000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344341503000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play Tennis</name><id>qnqfddyqnbjb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349524800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/76687822/</event_url></item>
