We'll also try to do a better job of pairing up abilities so that everyone will feel less pressure, relax and play at a comfortable level.  Bring fluids....or else!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tennis, around 11:30 or by mutual agreement, the gang is invited back to my place for an intimate (don't the wrong idea, I just have a small yard) lunch.  I live within 2 miles of Conard towards WH Center.  I'll supply dogs and burgers and would appreciate help with sides, desserts and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A head count will be appreciated so &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs will be much preferred over &amp;quot;maybes&amp;quot;.  In fact, if you plan on coming to only tennis or only lunch, please be specific in your RSVP.  Also, indicate in your response if you plan on bringing anything.  Chairs would be a huge help.  You can call me at 559-7983 or email me through the website.  I'll provide directions at tennis.  Did I forget anything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's count on good weather and a great turnout.  Stay in touch.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Red Hat &amp; Sunglasses</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214838861000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214355943000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis &amp; Lunch</name><id>8208736</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214658000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/8208736/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
