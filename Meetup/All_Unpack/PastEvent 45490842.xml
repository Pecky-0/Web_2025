We will hike a shortened version of last April's hike which was billed as one of the best hikes near Boston by the Boston Globe. Meet at headquarters prior to departure time as we head out to hike dirt roads and trails through a variety of forest and wildlife management areas, past bogs, campgrounds, ponds, and maybe more. Learn your way around the forest while we work off those holiday pounds. This trail will be mostly flat but with sandy, stony, and uneven patches so wear appropriate footwear as well as layers for the weather. Bring water, snacks, and your best friends of both the two- and four-legged persuasions. Plan on a little over 2 hours for this hike but the group will have the option of choosing to take a few short detours to points of interest.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325516794000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324917174000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January First Sunday Hike with EMS</name><id>45490842</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325433600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/45490842/</event_url></item>
