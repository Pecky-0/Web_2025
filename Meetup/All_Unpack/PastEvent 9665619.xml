I have been to this fabulous restaurant for drinks and apps but never tried out their brunch menu! But I am very excited cause the food was WONDERFUL the last time I was there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the reservation time on this - because they only except reservations at certain times. . . Also, I added a few more spots so more people could join in on the fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The reservation will be under Marie.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1236444823000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233697748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Highland Kitchen Brunch</name><id>9665619</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235318400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/9665619/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/d/global_6535197.jpeg</photo_url></item>
