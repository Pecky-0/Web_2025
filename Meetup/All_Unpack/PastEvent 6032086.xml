From the producers of Amelie and 18 different directors (including the Coen Brothers, Gus Van Sant and Alexander Payne), come 18 different love stories, each less than five minutes long and each inspired by and set in a different arrondissement (district) of Paris. The many faces of love and Paris are explored as each director creates a different take on the theme. A celebration of the wonder of love, that like love itself is variously amusing, whimsical, intriguing, and sad, but always moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is still being hosted by Nicole, who will still be standing at the front of the theater with a meetup sign during the credits. And yes, we will still be going to Boca Grande after the show for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541778000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184611743000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paris Je T'aime at Coolidge</name><id>6032086</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184973300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6032086/</event_url></item>
