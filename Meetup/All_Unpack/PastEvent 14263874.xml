The Gas Lamp Trivia Night starts earlier - 9:30 - and ON TIME. This way, we'll still finish at a decent hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each and every one of us is filled with countless bits of useless knowledge - Let's put them to good use! We placed 4th last time, though we were in the lead for the first round (Autumn says it was the frist 2!) We could have been contenders if some of our players didn't have to leave when it went so late. That won't happen here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gas Lamp has Pub Trivia every Monday, with drinks and gift certificates as prizes. Anything we win will be put toward drinks the next meetup there. Teams can be any size, so we can have one or more teams depending on the turnout. There's also $1 sliders and 25 cent wings ... Yummmmmm! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can respond 'maybe' if you must, but it's good to have an accurate count of attendees - they gave us 2 prime tables for comedy last night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come have fun and meet some great people!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at 8:30 - just ask the hostess for the Newport Friends Meetup Group.
