This time for a Booty Vortex show (&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/bootyvortex" target="_blank"&gt;the Boston Area's Finest Funk and Disco!&lt;/a&gt;).  Some of us will be getting there early for dinner at 8PM - join us at 9PM when we plan to bust out our hottest moves on the dance floor.  (As always, doesn't matter if you don't dance.  There's always a few SoJust folk hanging on the sidelines chatting it up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've been looking for like-minded progressives to dance with in Boston, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while hearing the latest funk tunes, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. Be sure not to miss it if you are ready to build cross-issue coalitions - AND have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189558895000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184425759000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dancing for Justice</name><id>6023057</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188000000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/6023057/</event_url></item>
