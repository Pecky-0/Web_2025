This ritual is profound, educational and great deal of fun. In a Puja you will stand in a circle with other people and practice many different meditations with those in the group. Through these exercises you will gain a deep understanding of Tantric principles and practices in a safe atmosphere to assist you in going deeper in your private relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Muir will be speaking about Tantra Yoga, an ancient spiritual system in which sexual love is considered a sacrament and the body the temple of the spirit. Of the hundreds of Yogic paths, it is the only one that gives an alternative to celibacy. It is a path for householders, where the two partners become One in an extended meditation wherein the entire body becomes an instrument of Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of tantric practice is not better sex, it is about Union. It increases intimacy and connection, honoring the divine goddess in every woman, awakening and releasing female and male sexual energy to move up through you, not out of you. It is about aligning and awakening all of the chakras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;Charles is giving away your choice of one of two of his awesome CD’s, “Intro to Tantra Practices and Principles” or “Beyond Beginner’s Tantra”, a Tantra Birthday gift to everyone who attends!
