Whether you're a new or experienced climber, come join us for a solid and fun workout before T-day feasting!  Toprope, sport leading, and bouldering available, including some tall walls up to 45 feet.  If you'd like to lead climb, don't forget your to bring your rope :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet up at 7:00 PM by the picnic table near the front bouldering area, to make introductions and team up.  You may be able to find me bouldering just before then.  If arriving later, just come find us on the walls.  Hopefully you can recognize me from my picture, and/or I'll try to remember to write a description of what I'm wearing on the white board near the bathrooms, so you can find us more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've never climbed here before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing.  Call the gym or see the website below for more info.  Full-access Day Pass $16.  Bouldering-Only Pass $14. Mondays are Women's Night: Women's Day Pass $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info and directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>9443907</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290538832000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289851056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MetroRock Monday 11/22</name><id>15455242</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290470400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/15455242/</event_url></item>
