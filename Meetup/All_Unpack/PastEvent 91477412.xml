Tom's in town and let's take him to a real diner for some good old fashioned bacon and eggs. &lt;br /&gt;

Tom needs us to push him out in Goodspeed. But I don't think they have a breakfast place. &lt;br /&gt;

So, lets go to KIJD, Willimantic Ct. Short hop, but a fun one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, one or all of us, needs to bring him to his folks near KMMK, Goodspeed Ct. and dump him off. Then he's their problem (again)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will vote for Tom for the next EAA President!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be there or be square... Just be there.&lt;/p&gt;
