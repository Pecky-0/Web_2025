In this presentation, Scott Arbeit from Seattle Integral will weave together the thinking of Ken Wilber, Ray Kurzweil, and Thomas P.M. Barnett, among others, to outline the most likely path for the unfolding of the Integral movement over the next 40 years, inviting all of us to find our best place in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touching on spirituality, technology, international relations, politics, the military, ecology, relationships, and whatever else pops up that day, we'll take an all-quadrant, multi-perspective look into our future... the Future of Integral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scott Arbeit is a co-leader of Seattle Integral. He first read Ken Wilber in 1998, and was one of the first members of the Boston Ken Wilber Meetup before moving to Seattle in 2008. He has spent his career in technology, recently left Microsoft, and currently makes his living playing poker. He is working on a book based on this material, tentatively entitled &amp;quot;The Future of Integral&amp;quot;.
