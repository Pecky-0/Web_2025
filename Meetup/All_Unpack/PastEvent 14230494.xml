Did you see an inner light or hear inner sound? Were you ever touched by Spirit, an angel, or an inner guide?  What was the experience like and how did it change your life since?  In this meetup, everyone is invited to share their experiences of spiritual closeness.  In many cases these experiences open the heart to greater insight and divine love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also lead the group in a spiritual exercise that can help awaken your relationship with Spirit, so that this creative source of life-giving energy can be more present and active in your daily lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you've had a spiritual experience you'd like to share, or would like to have one, I hope you can make it to this meetup.  We'll be in the Welles-Turner library community room, which is downstairs in the children's section.  The discussion should last about an hour.  Feel free to invite a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you then!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the community room which is to the left of the downstairs entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabelle Morton</member_name><member_id>10332926</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Morton</member_name><member_id>10808254</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284682311000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280254402000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>What Does It Feel Like to Touch Spirit?</name><id>14230494</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284678000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/14230494/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/2/global_11631042.jpeg</photo_url></item>
