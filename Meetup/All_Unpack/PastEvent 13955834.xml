The signing starts at 7, so we'll meet up at Pandemonium Books at 6:30. Afterwards, we might try to grab a bite to eat in Central Square.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm 6'4", brown hair, and I'll have a Hello My Name is Tom sticker on.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279115790000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277864550000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charles Stross Signing @ Pandemonium Books</name><id>13955834</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279060200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/13955834/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
