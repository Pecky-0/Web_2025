<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Okay, the &lt;a href="http://www.icaboston.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA)&lt;/a&gt; is not giving away free works to decorate your place or hang on the wall above your desk at the office. Thursday nights our friends at Target pay the way of every Tom, Dick, and Andy (Warhol) who want to check out modern/post-modern/pop pieces that may or may not have artistic merit. In other words, admission is free. I think it's mildly ironic that a mainstream, American, mega-discount store is sponsoring a night at a small museum that is supposed to be avant garde, but I like getting stuff for nothing, too. Come join me as I explore the ICA's funky, futuristic space cantilevered over the South Boston waterfront. Looking at art, especially mind-bending, expectation-disrupting art, creates an appetite for food and an urge to flee pretension. So after a couple of hours, we'll head to Lucky's Lounge for some real-deal, speakeasy-style dinner and live music (please RSVP via the separate meetup event listing if you're interested).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick</member_name><member_id>8504559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263683237000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258232165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Art at the ICA</name><id>11874827</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263510000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11874827/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/2/2/global_11800130.jpeg</photo_url></item>
