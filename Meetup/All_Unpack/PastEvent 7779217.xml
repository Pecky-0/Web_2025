To kick off the rock climbing season, I will be having a party at my place this Saturday at 6pm.  If the weather is nice, it may be an outside BBQ.  If the weather is not nice, we can stay inside and play pool on my pool table or possibly hit the bars later so call if you arrive late.  Newbies are welcome to come too.  There will be a couple other non-rock climbers there as well too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The place is 5 minutes from Davis Sq.
