Deep house and techno music will be playing all night long. The place is classy and the atmosphere is awesome.  The inside looks amazing and so is the food they serve.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boccarossawinebar.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://boccarossawine...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The owner of Hartford's Manhattan-meets-Miami-style club Room 960 have brought a new kind of lounge to Hartford’s downtown scene, one that sits just a few feet away from the happenin' house beats of 960 but offers a totally different feel. Nestled in the corner of the Residence Marriott Inn lobby, Bocca Rossa is a paninoteca, wine bar and lounge with a very cool vibe, decent eats and delicious drinks.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Metromix&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you can't find me text me:  860-922-1595</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296412195000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295988547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Go Deep at Bocca Rossa</name><id>16183115</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296352800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/16183115/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/e/global_21065230.jpeg</photo_url></item>
