I now know the time of the movie, and it's 7:30. I will be at the theater at 7:00. I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com, remember to choose the correct theater/date/time, the Loews Boston Common 19, Saturday the 16th, 7:30 pm.

I'll be wearing my red hat with the meetup logo. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables near the window. If downstairs, I'll be behind the rope where the tickets are torn across from the popcorn stand.

For new folks, if you miss the gathering before the film, no worries, we regroup after the film just outside the room where the film shows. And then we go out to discuss the movie over munchies and a beer. Or two. 

[b]Synopsis[/b]

Next summer, the guys who brought you Superbad reunite for the action-comedy "Pineapple Express." Lazy stoner Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) has only one reason to visit his equally lazy dealer Saul Silver (James Franco): to purchase weed, specifically, a rare new strain called Pineapple Express. But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop (Rosie Perez) and the city's most dangerous drug lord (Gary Cole), he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene. Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him. And it is. As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia; incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both. All aboard the Pineapple Express.

The film is directed by David Gordon Green ("All the Real Girls"). The screenplay is by Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg from a story by Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg. Judd Apatow and Shauna Robertson produce.
