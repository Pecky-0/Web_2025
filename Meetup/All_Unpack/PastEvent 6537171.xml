Everyone is invited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;            7:00 - 7:15 organizer (introductions and announcements)&lt;br /&gt;            7:15 - 7:30 canvassing leader (announcements and solicitations)&lt;br /&gt;            7:30 - 7:40 organizer (book giveaway, plea for help, teams for GOP meeting)&lt;br /&gt;            7:40- 8:00  open for members presentation/pitches (by pre-arrangement)&lt;br /&gt;            8:00 - ...    individual groups planning and arrangements for events&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so we know if we need to change venues due to a large crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We will attempt to connect with several out-of-state meetups during this time via (undisclosed) live link so that we may coordinate their help and interest in NH events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This will also mean that they will have some idea of our participation and 'active-ness'.&lt;br /&gt; You could say that I am challenging all of you to show the rest of the country that we are worthy of their help by attending this meeting sufficiently. Or, you could say this is another pipedream of the eccentric right-brained (dis)organizer, Whatever your opinion, I am going as public as I possibly can with this meeting. It's up to you whether this works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have asked everybody I know to attend. If we need more help, it must be up to you to bring it. BRING IT!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PS - I am asking for  voluntary $10 contribution to pay for materials (sign frames already built and deployed, and to help Papergraphics defray their costs in publishing thousands and thousands of leaflets for groups across the country. Incidentally, other groups have paid for publishing of material that we have been handing out) - voluntary only - do not stay away from the meeting because of this - we will find the money we need. I don't care if you bring money, or energy, ideas, stories - just bring yourself and some friends and we'll figure out what to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!
