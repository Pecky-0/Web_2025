October 27 from 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, October 27th, Manchester Community College (MCC) will once again host the Annual Empty Bowls Project in support of Foodshare. Now in its 15th year, Empty Bowls is a fun and filling way to give to Foodshare and bring home some hand-crafted pottery. At the MCC culinary center you can make a suggested donation to Foodshare, pick out a bowl crafted by local potters and MCC art students, and fill it (as many times as you’d like!) with soup from local restaurants and MCC’s amazing student chefs. From 10:00 am – 3:00 pm, the Manchester Art Association Craft Fair will also be taking place featuring many talented, local artists and crafters. Stop by, enjoy a great lunch for a great cause, andget some holiday shopping done as well!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda</member_name><member_id>3403216</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351825349000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346075337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Empty Bowls Event - Fundraiser for Foodshare</name><id>79547942</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351350000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/79547942/</event_url></item>
