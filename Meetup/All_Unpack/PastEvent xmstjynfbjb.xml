<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Walk a portion of the Canalside Rail Trail from the Food City parking lot on Avenue A in Turners Falls to the rail yard in South Deerfield, with a possible side trip along the Migratory Way.  The rail trail passes behind the commercial buildings on Avenue A and follows the power canal, then crosses Montague City Road near the Farren Care Center and continues over the old railroad bridge across the Connecticut River, past part of the nursery fields for Stewart's nursery, and terminates at the train yard in South Deerfield.  This is an out-and-back trip, should take about 2 hours; if we still have energy we can cross the 11th street bridge in Turners and walk the other side of the canal along Migratory Way to see the various birds that rest in the waters ahead of the power station.  This walk is on flat, paved roads the whole way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristi's cell is 413-230-6757 if all else fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Kristi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a black lab w/blue leash, &amp; vanilla PT Cruiser; will be parked near Aubuchon</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268075460000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266178267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Western Mass Dogs March Meetup - Over the River to see the Trains</name><id>xmstjynfbjb</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267902000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/12603279/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/a/e/global_13208734.jpeg</photo_url></item>
