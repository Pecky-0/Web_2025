This will be on 2 courts. One court will be a high level intermediate/advanced game with people playing formations (6-2, 5-1). Mention in your RSVP if you have a preference of court to play on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intermediate - Players with firm understanding of game strategy. Should have a good grasp of skills (passing, setting, hitting). For indoor games, 5-1 / 6-2 formation experience highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entrance to the gym is on Cambridge Street opposite the Skendarian Apothecary. The nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street and Roberts Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Please RSVP if you plan on attending. RSVP's will close on the day of the game at 10 AM. If you show up at the game but do not have a &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; RSVP, you will not be guaranteed to get playing time.&lt;br /&gt;* Please be serious about RSVP's. If you RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and don't show up, it means you have prevented someone else from attending. Also, please change your RSVP if you find out you can't play, as soon as possible. Changing the RSVP a few hours before the game time means that there will be less people who can play, as most people prefer some advance notice that there are spots available.&lt;br /&gt;* If the game is full, and you sign up for the waiting list, you will get an email if a spot opens up. You can then go to the website and sign up.&lt;br /&gt;* Please be at the &amp;quot;intermediate and up&amp;quot; level if you RSVP Yes. If you are not at the appropriate level of play, you will not be allowed to play, and you will have taken the spot of someone who could have played. If you are not sure about your level, please ask an organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the meetup will be between $3 and $5, depending on the number of attendees. Please pay the organizer when you arrive before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of the court rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk from the T stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as meters and residential parking rules are generally not enforced on Sundays (parking signs should say &amp;quot;EX SUNDAY&amp;quot; or similar).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the Chinese guy wearing a pair of black framed sport goggles.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1242496173000</updated><rating><average>3.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241386915000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CRLS Intermediate+ Indoor Volleyball Sun 5/10 2PM</name><id>10328152</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241978400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/10328152/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
