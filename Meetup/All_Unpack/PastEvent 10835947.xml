The consistency of factory spun wool was better in that it was more uniform, and its weight could be gauged better as a consequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city of Nottingham, particularly the district known as Lace Market, dominated the production of machine-knitted lace during the Industrial Revolution and the following decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262448388000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247107620000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Do That Yarn Thing  -Wednesday Dec 30</name><id>10835947</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262215800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835947/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/1/global_9564833.jpeg</photo_url></item>
