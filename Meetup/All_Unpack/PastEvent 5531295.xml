Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns over a game of Boggle? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions while playing Scattegories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOIN SOCIALIZING FOR JUSTICE AT SOUL FIRE BBQ FOR GAME NIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No program. No speaker. &lt;br /&gt;Just bring your favorite board game and enjoy yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP - YES, MAYBE OR NO &lt;br /&gt;WHAT BOARD GAME(S) ARE YOU BRINGING OR WANT TO PLAY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;SoJust is for feminists, people working against racism, class activists, queer pioneers, genderbenders, environmentalists, artists and all people across Greater Boston working for justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's not work! Instead, we're building a progressive cross-issue network through fun social events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At SoJust events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175125743000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172879590000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scrabblerousers for Justice!
