We will skip one meeting since it would fall on Thanksgiving Thursday. We will continue on December 13th instead with Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise. We plan to spend 3 meetings on this text, so we  plan to cover the first 6 chapters (it has 20 chapters) on this first meeting. We also settled the plan so after the Theological-Political Treatise we will continue with John Locke. We will have one meeting on Plato's Meno as preparation then we will go onto Locke: An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542595000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194957381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CANCELED!
