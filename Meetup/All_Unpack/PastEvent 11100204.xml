Many people have heard stories or had experiences of these realms, only to be invalidated by a culture which does not believe in things it cannot see. The spiritual world is a vast expanse of consciousness and energetic vibration which is much higher than that of the physical world. Oneâ€™s spiritual senses must be cultivated and activated through prayer and meditation in order to relate to the higher worlds. Come and begin to reclaim your spiritual senses and experience these realities for yourself. &lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the presenter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 Centers of Light in cities across the country.
