<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the world.  Great Pond is a shallow pond with lots of waterfowl.  It is surrounded by pine and hemlock woodlands.  There are interesting places to sit and rest with a wonderful view of the pond.  The forest was selected to be Tree Farm Number One in Connecticut, meaning it was receiving good timber management while privately owned.  The owner, James L Goodwin, bequeathed the property to the State as a public sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 miles with very level walking.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for about 1 hour.  The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  Caution, Don’t confuse this place with another place with a similar name.  This one is in Simsbury.
