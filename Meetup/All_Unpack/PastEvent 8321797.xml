The now famous &amp;quot;Ultimate Cruise Night&amp;quot; in Westford offers the additional excitement of live local band entertainment and our delicious Kimball Farm BBQ grill. The band this night is &amp;quot;The Continentals&amp;quot;... There is also their Legendary Ice Cream Buffet. What better way is there to spend a Summer evening. Admission for the general public is $3.00 for adults and children under 12 are free. &lt;br /&gt;This was lot of fun last year and afterwards we headed over to the Westford Grille for cold drinks and alot of laughs....bring a blanket or beach chair to sit on and join us for a good time. Let's gather in front of the stage area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is &amp;quot;weather permitting&amp;quot;...if it needs to be canceled we can still meet for burgers and a few brews at the Westford Grille. I will post an update that afternoon if the plan changes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be the rowdy ones gathering in front of the stage!! :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218927907000</updated><rating><average>4.44999980927</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
