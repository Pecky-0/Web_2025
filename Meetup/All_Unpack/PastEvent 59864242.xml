&lt;p&gt;This beautiful walk meanders along a babbling brook on Middle Mountain Road, a gated logging road in the pristine southern part of the trails of Mt. &amp;nbsp;Toby. The road is wide for dogs to romp and people to socialize and has lovely scenery of &amp;nbsp;woodlands and water. As with any wooded trail, be prepared for mud if it has rained, ice if it has snowed and some ruts and rocks no matter what &amp;nbsp;the weather. &amp;nbsp;This walk is more rustic than some, but well worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location: Access is from Rte 116 &amp;nbsp;(Amherst Road) in Sunderland. From either direction, turn &amp;nbsp;onto North Silver Lane, then turn right on Reservoir Road, then left on Cross Mountain Rd. There is parking at the end &amp;nbsp;and along the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amount of Time: We plan to walk up and back on the road for about a total of 1.5 hours but the amount of time you wish to walk is up to you since it is a road that is easily followed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, all dogs must start on leash until we know everybody gets along. After that it's all romp and play time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michele</member_name><member_id>12891818</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michelle </member_name><member_id>34071322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334431466000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333999197000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beautiful Walk on Middle Mountain Road- PM version</name><id>59864242</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334426400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/59864242/</event_url></item>
