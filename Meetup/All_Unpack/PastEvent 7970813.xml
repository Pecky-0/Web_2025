After nearly an hour dancing on the wire, he was arrested, taken for psychological evaluation, and brought to jail before he was finally released. James Marsh?s documentary brings Petit?s extraordinary adventure to life through the testimony of Philippe himself, and some of the co-conspirators who helped him create the unique and magnificent spectacle that became known as ?the artistic crime of the century.? This is the Official Opening Night Film for the Newport International Film Festival. (Winner of the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at Sundance 2008.)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price will be posted when tickets go on sale.
