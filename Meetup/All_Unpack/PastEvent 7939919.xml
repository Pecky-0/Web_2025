Beginner hikers or those short on time should find this an appropriate hike. The trail takes you to the summit of Mt. Hedgehog (2520'). The grade is moderate and only the final sections require a little extra effort. The advantage in taking the loop in a clockwise direction is to view the Presidential Range and Mt. Washington as you reach the summit from the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hedgehog is strikingly shaped with Allen's Ledge on the north, and the huge East ledges on Little Hedgehog. The vantage point from Allen's Ledge, located 1.1 miles up the west fork of the trail, affords remarkable views of Mt. Passaconaway, Mt. Chocorua, the Moats, the presidential Range, the Carrigain Range, and many other eastern peaks. On a clear day even the observatory on top of Mt. Washington is visible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essential Info&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mileage: 4.8 miles compete loop&lt;br /&gt;             east ledges 2.0 miles&lt;br /&gt;             Hedgehog summit 2.9 mile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficulty: Easy to Moderate&lt;br /&gt;Loop elevation range: 1250'-2532'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;         &lt;br /&gt;We would like to see at least 3 &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVP's to create a meetup.
