To my mind, rare are the times when we give without taking. Even then...if we are being really honest with ourselves, we are taking something. So, what do we take when we give? And if we decide to take, are we giving anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are large questions, I know. But there is little that great literature hasn't covered. Could you look there for insights into these questions? These can be in the form of a poem, fable, excerpt from a story, novel, play (even diary or letter)...you get the idea. If you decide to bring something to share with the group, please be sure it takes about 5 minutes to read. (And if possible, let me know what it is, so I can plan ahead.) Otherwise, please come to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll announce the location shortly. It will likely be somewhere close to the Red Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
