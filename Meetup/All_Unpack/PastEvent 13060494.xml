Want some help keeping on track?  Hoping to meet others who are also available on a weekday morning?  Well then, bring your work, a positive attitude and a resolution to get things done and let's change all that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll each grab a drink and share our goals for the &amp;quot;study session&amp;quot; and then get to work.  This is just a test run.  If it works well and people request another one, terrific.  If not, no worries.  It's at least worth a shot with so many members who are self-employed, unemployed, in graduate school, in retail, etc., right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panera is close to the Wellington T station, has plenty of parking and free WiFi, not to mention delicious lattes.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a wide blue Colombian coffee can in the center of our table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271252258000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270148621000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Non-alcoholic Happy Hour  ; )</name><id>13060494</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271079000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/13060494/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/8/global_6854760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
