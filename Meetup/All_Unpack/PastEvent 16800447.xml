I know how we all like FREE movies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenings tend to fill up early (we're not the only group that is invited), so I suggest meeting at 6:00 for the 7:00 showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a NoOrg, meaning that an organizer isn't necessarily going to attend. So it's up to you, collectively, to self-organize. You need to print a pass before you head to the theater, as tickets are not sold for this showing. (See details below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the show!&lt;/p&gt;

When the client&amp;rsquo;s teenage grandson runs away from home and shows up on his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s doorstep, Mike&amp;rsquo;s life is turned upside down.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A win-win arrangement turns into something much more complicated than he ever bargained for.  McCarthy&amp;rsquo;s deft touch balancing drama and comedy, broken hearts and poignant humanity is at play in WIN WIN. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
