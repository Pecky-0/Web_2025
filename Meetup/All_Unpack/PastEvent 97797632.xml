&lt;p&gt;Driven by vengeance. Destined for peace. &lt;br /&gt;

 Niger, West Africa, 2070: &lt;br /&gt;

 After fifteen-year old Ejii witnesses her father's beheading, her world shatters. In an era of mind-blowing technology and seductive magic, Ejii embarks on a mystical journey to track down her father's killer. With a newfound friend by her side, Ejii comes face to face with an earth turned inside outâ€”and with her own magical powers. &lt;br /&gt;

 But Ejii soon discovers that her travels across the sands of the Sahara have a greater purpose. Her people need to be protected from a force seeking to annihilate them. And Ejii may be just the hero to do it. &lt;br /&gt;

 This futuristic, fantastical adventure heralds a bright new talent on the YA fantasy scene.&lt;/p&gt;
