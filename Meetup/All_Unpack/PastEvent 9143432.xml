Bring a used copy of your favorite book and wrap it up for the swap.  You do not have to participate in the swap to still come and enjoy the book club discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the synopsis of &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;On the Road&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Road chronicles Jack Kerouac's years traveling the North American continent with his friend Neal Cassady, &amp;quot;a sideburned hero of the snowy West.&amp;quot; As &amp;quot;Sal Paradise&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Dean Moriarty,&amp;quot; the two roam the country in a quest for self-knowledge and experience. Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz combine to make On the Road an inspirational work of lasting importance.  Kerouac's classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be &amp;quot;Beat&amp;quot; and has inspired every generation since its initial publication more than forty years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in December and I hope you enjoy the book!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask the bartender or hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231887126000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226452270000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club December Meetup - On The Road</name><id>9143432</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228867200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/9143432/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/3/3/global_6287171.jpeg</photo_url></item>
