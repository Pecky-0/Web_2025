If the weather is still good and it's not too cool we can hold the meet up in our outdoor yard. If the weather is bad or people prefer to be indoors we can have it in our indoor playroom. Either way the dogs will have fun running around chasing eachother! Hope to see everyone there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I will put out some beverages and some food to munch on. Also, If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know and we can schedule an appointment with 25% off.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259000505000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Boston-Active-Small-Dog-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1444277</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Small Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256407812000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Small Dog November Meetup</name><id>11701594</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258826400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Greater-Boston-Active-Small-Dog-Meetup-Group/events/11701594/</event_url></item>
