In recent weeks, we've practiced a variety of games that enable audience participation. In this rehearsal, which formally concludes our training, we will iron out the kinks behind opening, transitioning, and closing our final selection of games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will perform, more than likely, within a couple weeks at a selected venue of therapy. Based on the time slot our group receives, we can look forward to an abbreviated rehearsal immediately before our scheduled performance. Until then, this rehearsal will serve as our dress rehearsal. Please wear comfortable clothes the likes of which you would wear on performance day and for our planned group photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In anticipation of our show, our group commentary will center on show structure and flow rather than any individual's work. By the end of rehearsal, every member will know exactly what they will be doing at any particular point of the show. Given our agenda, members are asked to mentally revisit the conceptual theory and game rules discussed over the course of training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's keep up the excellent work folks, and see you all soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Please check back within the next couple days for a final decision on meeting time. You may post on the message board if you have a strong preference.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244414299000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240200354000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting 8: Dress Rehearsal</name><id>10223189</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241384400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/10223189/</event_url></item>
