We will cover the topic of MEDITATION AND PRAYER WITH CHILDREN and how to help them to develop a LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD and Its creation. All faith are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my work as a minister,  as a family support specialist for the City of Cambridge and as a parent myself, I have witnessed and experienced that children thrive when they feel love and experience a sense of belonging to creation. Whatever your faith may be, spirituality plays an important part in your child's development and well being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is $10/person or $15/couple&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249771209000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248304210000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation with children and conscious parenting</name><id>10936323</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248910200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/10936323/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/8/global_1017208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
