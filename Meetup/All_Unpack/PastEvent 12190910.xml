I've never been there for a showing and I'm not certain how much is there with this exhibit. Shall we group up by 6:15 pm, wander around until the gallery closes, then go out to dinner somewhere after? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the Suffolk University Site&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/offices/32711.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.suffolk.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In honor of Historic New England’s centennial, the Adams Gallery presents The Preservation Movement Then and Now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The exhibition, organized by Historic New England, traces the history of the preservation movement in New England. The catalyst: an unsuccessful effort in 1863 to save the Hancock House, which was built in 1737 on Beacon Hill. It later was home to patriot John Hancock, he of the famous signature&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a lobby inside the main entrance of the law school, let's meet up there. T.J. Maher will want to wait somewhere where he is not exposed to the elements. T.J. is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. T.J. will be there starting at 6:00 pm. We can attempt to find the Adams Gallery at 6:15 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adams Gallery&lt;br /&gt;David J. Sargent Hall&lt;br /&gt;Suffolk University Law School&lt;br /&gt;120 Tremont Street, Boston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More about the exhibit&lt;/b&gt; (from Dec. 14, 2009, through March 15, 2010)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/offices/32711.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.suffolk.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Historic New England was founded to protect early buildings such as the Hancock House from being lost to development or neglect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;The Preservation Movement Then and Now&lt;/b&gt; highlights other areas in New England preservation as well.  There is a section on one of the first preservationists, William Sumner Appleton, founder of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England), describing how Appleton realized that many early buildings throughout New England were disappearing and was concerned that little would remain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The exhibition also explores how the movement changed from saving historic sites to downtown revitalization, environmental conservation, land and shoreline preservation, and saving not a single building, but whole neighborhoods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In addition to panels describing the relationship of the Hancock House to the preservation movement, the exhibit employs photographs, artifacts, and online access to Historic New England collections to illustrate the organization’s continuing efforts to make the region’s heritage available and enjoyable to all&amp;quot;.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Adams Gallery&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/offices/1104.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.suffolk.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Suffolk University’s Adams Gallery presents exhibits on historical themes.
