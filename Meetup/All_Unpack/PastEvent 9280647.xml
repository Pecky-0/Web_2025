We'll also have free bike stickers, and red taillights and Bicycling Streets Smarts for $2 apiece. No other agenda than enjoyment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, take a road trip to Westbrook! The party will be held at the home John and Mary Brooking, accessible until 11 PM by the #4 Metro Bus (details below). Hardy souls who want to ride to the event are encourage to organize bike trains along your route. Attach festive colored lights to your bike and be a moving holiday display! Please advertise your bike train by posting comments on the events page announcing your schedule, or contact other members directly if you already know them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the #4 Metro Bus, see schedule &lt;a href="http://www.gpmetrobus.com/images//8-08--updated%20rt4.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and be aware of the peculiarities of this route:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outbound busses to Westbrook alternate between going directly up Brighton or joining Brighton at Rosement Corner via Forest and Woodford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;All busses after about 5:30 PM begin and end up at Saco Street in Westbrook, just a few houses down from us. (Saco Street is two streets over from Mechanic, parallel to it. However, the bus often stops near an office building on right on Mechanic or on Quimby (a cross street) after finishing its outbound route and waiting to turn around for the inbound. You might want to just ask the driver to let you off at Mechanic.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last inbound bus leaves at 11:15 PM, via Woodford and Forest. The last inbound that uses Brighton all the way to Bedford is unfortunately only 7:50 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to combine a bike and bus trip, but are unsure of how to put your bike on the bus' bike rack, remember that we have a &lt;a href="http://www.gpcog.org/Transportation_and_Land_Use/Bikerack.php" target="_blank"&gt;video from GoMaine&lt;/a&gt; describing exactly how to do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE FOR A GREAT TIME!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231979381000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228414070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Commuters Holiday Party</name><id>9280647</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229815800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/9280647/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/2/global_2949602.jpeg</photo_url></item>
