Come by Cantina La Mexicana, 247 Washington St.,  between 6pm and 8pm for a family style Mexican dinner including - tamales, quesadillas and burros (oh my!).  Let's not forget some tasty sangria!  For just $11 you can taste some Mexican favorites and a bit of sangria, AND you can learn more about the Wedeln Ski &amp;amp; Outdoors Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have information about the club and some of the events that we run.  Many of our favorite activities are held up north at our ski house in Bartlett NH so this is your chance to meet us before you commit for a weekend event.  We can also collect $ for Excellent Adventure Weekend if you plan to come up north for the final weekend in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not want the food then just come by after 8pm and hang out.  No cost (but no food) after 8pm.  We will stay at Cantina until at least 9pm and then may hit a couple of the local bars.  Union Square is best known for the &amp;quot;The Independent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Precinct&amp;quot; bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lataqueria.us/Cantina_La_Mexicana/Welcome.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lataqueria...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will take over at least half the bar/restaurant.
