Now that the holidays are over, I have had the time to put together our first meetup.  We will be heading out to Jillian's on landsdowne street (right next to Fenway) to have a few drinks and play pool and maybe do some bowling!  There is no fee to attend this event but you will have to pay for your own food and drinks as well as any of the games you play.  You are welcome to bring as many people as you like!!  I'm really looking forward to meeting all of you!!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910704</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170115844000</updated><rating><average>3.79999995232</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>New Residents</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-666</urlname><id>375609</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston New In Town Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1167752940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A night full of fun and games!!!!</name><id>5358647</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1169942400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-666/events/5358647/</event_url></item>
