This one is a one-time-only seminar (while Tuesday's meetup is part of a series of classes), and the topic is a very relevant one for people who are seriously interested in spirituality and finding out about their own spiritual nature.  See the seminar description below, and we'll see you all Thursday evening. Feel free to email if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Johanna&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS You can bring a friend for free and split the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many say they believe in God, but believing in God is not the same as having a direct experience of God. Direct means first-hand, not second-hand. It is not hearsay or conjecture. Direct means something happens to you. You go through something, and then you can say you have had an experience. Throughout history, belief in God has resulted in people gathering for worship in churches, mosques, and temples. All over the world people still congregate based on similar beliefs about God. But how many can really say they know God? Come to this seminar to learn more about having a direct experience of God. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
