With the revolution, fashion went from the king's court to the people, causing a rapid evolution in clothing. Naturally, women's pieces changed, but clothing for men, priests and soldiers also evolved. After the revolution, men and women of the elegant Parisian society began to buy clothing from the new fashion stores that were becoming more talked about than politics. Men especially were taking more interest in the whimsical elements of fashion, allowing themselves more eccentricities. Rebelling against social norms, the privileged youth, known as the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses, were leading a fashionable, artistocratic subculture. &lt;br /&gt;

Discover these profound changes in fashion through a collection of charming watercolors previously shown at the prestigious Palazzo Pitti in Florence. &lt;br /&gt;

Complimentary French wine will be served at the opening reception&lt;/p&gt;
