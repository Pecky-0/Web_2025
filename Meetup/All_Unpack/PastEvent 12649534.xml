Will need a head count.  They can handle people who are heavy but want to know before hand if people weigh 250 or more so they will have the proper horses available. &lt;br /&gt;Here is the web site.     &lt;a href="http://www.crowleyshorses.com/trailridesponyrides" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.crowleysho...&lt;/a&gt;   Looks like a nice place.  Check it out.&lt;a href="http://www.crowleyshorses.com/trailridesponyrides" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWeather looks like it will cooperate.  I propose we meet at the Wrentham outlets at 8:30, leave by 9 - it's a good 2 1/2 hour ride via the Mass Pike; bring your transponder if you have one.   The ride back will take about 3 1/2 hours as it's all back roads.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary H </member_name><member_id>8947310</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287232531000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266608739000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Horseback Riding</name><id>12649534</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287226800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/12649534/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/b/global_9177195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
