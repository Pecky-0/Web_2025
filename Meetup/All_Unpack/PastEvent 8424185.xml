Take advantage of their gracious offer.... Charley&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glider rides are held by the Greater Boston Soaring Club, at Sterling airport, 3B3. GBSC is the largest glider club in New England, with some 150 members. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This event will probably start around mid-morning and go on until late afternoon, but the best thermals are often from 11:00 till 4:00, for the longer rides. We tow up to 2.5k or 3k ft. then release. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Normally intro rides are $100, and this group rate is $75. The tow planes are Pawnees and a Birddog. I am one of the towpilots. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This year we are offering the discounted rate for a combination of interested groups. Towing should start mid-morning, and it will be first come first served, so get you names on the list ASAP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As last year, certified pilots should be able to get a glider flight endorsement from a CFIG in their logbook. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred will be making a list of those that reply so to better judge the support required for this grand event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Gammon&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218121698000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217209878000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Glider Rides at Sterling 3b3</name><id>8424185</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217948400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/8424185/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
