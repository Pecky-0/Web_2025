It is free, but you must bring food/dessert/beverage (alcoholic or not) to share. The music is normally like 6 or 7 groups jamming whatever they feel like...folk, country, blue grass, instrumental, Bea...tles, acoustic pop, etc. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Contra dancing starts around 10pm. They keep it simple, and it gets a bit crowded, so it's not too athletic. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you're a "Maybe" please say so in your RSVP &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

People of all ages are likely to be there...from 8 to 80. The vibe is generally a bit country/hippie. If you're bringing alcohol, what seems to be most common at their events is wine. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Contra dancing is a "called" social folk dance descended from English and French country dancing. You will randomly pair up with people and constantly change partners all night. No experience needed, they walk you through what you need to do. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

HOST: Jason, cell # in my RSVP.Â  Texting is fine &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

PARKING: There are driveways to dirt lots just before and just after the house. But they're not big so you may have to park along the main road. Or park on the nearby side-street (Hatfield Hill Rd) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

See their website for parking info. &lt;br /&gt;
