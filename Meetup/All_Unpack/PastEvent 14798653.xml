Conveniently timed if you're going to be at the lunch at Grasshopper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The starting point is the park near the rotary closest to Trader Joe's Micro Center on Memorial Drive (better directions to all yes rsvps!). There is generally parking there which is a great reason to use it as a meeting point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will loop around the Charles for between 3 to 5k depending on what folks want to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come even if you're not a great runner - I'm not either!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bernard</member_name><member_id>7094823</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284930642000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284687087000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casual Sunday Run on the Charles River Esplanade</name><id>14798653</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284926400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/14798653/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
