They have you sit at long tables when the tour is done, give you each a Sam Adams sample glass to keep, and pass down pitcher after pitcher of beer teaching you about how to be a beer connoisseur.  Last time I went they passed out one that will never even go into production, but won some sort of contest - it tasted like circus peanuts!&lt;br /&gt;3) If you're doing it right, you'll be 3 sheets to the wind by 1:00.  And who knows where the rest of the day will take us with a start like that!&lt;br /&gt;4) The tour is a requested donation of $2 only, and that $2 is located to local charities.  Just make sure you bring along some singles for the donation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hit up the www.mbta.com trip planner for walking directions, but it's not too far from the Stony Brook T-Stop...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call my cell - 608-469-9444</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245329930000</updated><rating><average>4.82000017166</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243016848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>By request...
