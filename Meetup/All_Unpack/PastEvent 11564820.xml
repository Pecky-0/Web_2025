NOV. 1 DUE TO THE WEATHER. THE MAZE WAS CLOSED ON SATURDAY DUE TO LIGHT RAIN. HEAVY STORMS ARE EXPECTED THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR EVENT AND SO THE MAZE IS EXPECTED TO BE CLOSED FOR SUNDAY. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR RSVP IF YOU CAN GO ON SUNDAY, NOV. 1. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey there all you incubators, Jason and I thought it would be awesome fun if a bunch of us got together and went to the Davis Mega Maze out in Sterling. This is one of the best corn field mazes in New England and absolutely the funnest on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a day long event. It takes an hour to get there and you easily need a few hours in the maze. So if we left somewhere around 10 a.m. from Boston, we would get there around 11 a.m. Then we could have some lunch (they sell burgers, dogs, chicken sandwiches, etc... and, of course, ears of corn). After lunch we could venture into the maze. We would break up into groups. The time to go through the maze varies from 1-3 hours. And there are those that take longer. We would probably leave between 3 and 4 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this will be a carpooling event. So if you are interested in going, sign up and then indicate if you have a car and can drive people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing is the price. If we can get 20 people or more, the price goes from $19.95 PP to $9.95 PP. And it is always fun with more people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come on out for an A-MAZE-ING INCUBATOR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the link to Davis Mega Maze:   &lt;a href="https://www.davisfarmland.com/megamaze/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.davisfarm...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will carpool from Boston or Cambridge.
