How did it make you feel? What did you learn? Did the experience help you overcome the fear of death or give you a greater understanding of heaven, life-after-death, reincarnation, or divine love? Was your relationship with this person healed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have had dreams of loved ones who have died. These dreams can be very moving, healing, and spiritual. We will discuss this type of dream and what it can teach. We will also share techniques for contacting a departed loved one through the dream state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will take place Saturday, March 13th, at 10:30AM in the Manchester Whiton Library meeting room, upstairs. The same place we held our meetup in January. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabelle Morton</member_name><member_id>10332926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268667278000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267044292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dreams of Loved Ones Who Have Died</name><id>12697842</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268494200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/12697842/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/2/global_11631042.jpeg</photo_url></item>
