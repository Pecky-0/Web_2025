The last one I caught was terrific, and its exciting to see so many people turn out to pay homage to the great classics. They're so good, however, that the seats fill up fast, so even though the concert starts at 8, I think we'll try to meet there at 7:30 and grab seats no later than 7:45.&lt;br /&gt;Here is their mailer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Light of Light&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;YALE SCHOLA CANTORUM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Layton conducts English choral masterpieces. Yale Schola Cantorum, Simon Carrington, director and soloists from the Yale Voxtet, James Taylor, adviser. Music of Britten, Byrd, and MacMillan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where:&lt;br /&gt;St. Mary's Church&lt;br /&gt;5 Hillhouse Ave., New Haven&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when:&lt;br /&gt;January 19 @ 8 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price: Free&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come on out and hear some great music!
