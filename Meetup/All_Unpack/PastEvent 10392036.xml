<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Alright boys, &lt;br /&gt;the night before the big group event of the month we will be having a low key traditional meetup in New Haven, on Friday night, May 29th at 8 PM. Getting there early to get food and get in a social mood. We will most likely bounce to another spot during the course of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that at the end of the month, non-participating memebers will be given notice that they may be deleted from the Connecticut Wingmen. Please make sure to RSVP to ensure this does not happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look at my picture or call me (203) 410 6861</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242103627000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night - May 29th - New Haven</name><id>10392036</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243641600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10392036/</event_url></item>
