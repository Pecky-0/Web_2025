<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Day pond was built to run an up and down saw mill by the Day family.  The trail system extends into Salmon River State Forest.  Hunting is not allowed on Sundays.  Hopefully the trees will be in full color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about three miles with average ups and downs.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for about two hours or as fate may have it.  I have not visited this place in many years, and I will be following the trail map.  The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  (approximate address, no mailbox there) 141 Day Pond Rd, Colchester, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Colchester&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=141+Day+Pond+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=06415-2608&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.555576&amp;amp;longitude=-72.418753&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>29</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288217205000</updated><rating><average>3.59999990463</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287409416000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Day Pond State Park Walk, Colchester, CT</name><id>15145340</id><headcount>37</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287941400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/15145340/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/0/7/global_239895.jpeg</photo_url></item>
