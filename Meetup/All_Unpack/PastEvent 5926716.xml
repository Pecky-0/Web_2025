We'll have two trucks in the parade filled with period-garb-wearing Paul supporters, celebrating the birth of this nation's freedom.  More folks are needed to ride in the trucks--and to hand out literature to the local crowd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're willing to ride, email me at mail@ronpaulhq.com, and plan to be at the Ashland Firehouse at 9am.  If you're willing to cheer, wear your Paul t-shirt, and hand out campaign literature, meet us in the Ashland state liquor store parking lot at 9:30--we'll give you some handouts and then head on over.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183730877000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182625582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ashland 4th of July Parade</name><id>5926716</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183557600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/5926716/</event_url></item>
