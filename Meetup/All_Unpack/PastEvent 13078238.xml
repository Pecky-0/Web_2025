We're an informal group and everyone runs at their own pace. Starting out with the group is a good reason to get out of bed on a Saturday morning! You can also decide own mileage by turning around whenever you like, and you don't have to worry about getting lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've had more people coming out in recent weeks - if you been thinking of coming, give it a try! The more people who come, the more likely everyone will find a pace partner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet behind Pier One closest to the canal trail entrance on Skiff.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenny C</member_name><member_id>8045820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270920195000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270328589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday morning run 4/10 - Farmington Canal trail</name><id>13078238</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270900800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/13078238/</event_url></item>
