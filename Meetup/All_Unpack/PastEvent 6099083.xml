This is Portsmouth's most heavily Republican Ward, and it will be a great opportunity to provide literature to households that consistently vote in Republican primaries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting in the parking lot of the strip mall which holds the Fed Ex Kinko's Office &amp;amp; Print store, at 751 Lafayette Rd, at 2:00 PM. Maps, literature and walk lists will be provided by the campaign. Bring a comfortable pair of shoes and friend for two hours of spreading the message of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little block party starting at 6 pm on Saturday.  Not sure how big it will be since we only have five houses on the block, but any canvassers are welcome to come and cool off with a beverage or two.  It's on Friend Street, which is a dead end off of Cass Street.  This is about a half mile from Kinkos.  Take a right out of the Kinkos parking lot onto Lafayette (not the Rt. 1 by-pass), this turns into Middle Street, and Cass Street is a left off of Middle (well before you hit downtown).  We are the third house down on the left on the corner of Cass and Friend (254 Cass, tall white w/ fence).  You'll see the Ron Paul sign and the beautiful front steps that Joel Winters built!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186693563000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185818540000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portsmouth Lit Drop</name><id>6099083</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186250400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6099083/</event_url></item>
