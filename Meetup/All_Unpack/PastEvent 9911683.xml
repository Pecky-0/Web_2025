The following plot synopsis is borrowed from Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The drama centers on Reuben Flood, who loses his salesman job. While searching for a new job, he must deal with his wife, Cora, who shuns intimacy and mistakes his joblessness for stinginess, his shy daughter who prepares for her first dance and his pre-teen son who runs to his mama instead of dealing with bullies. He tries to comfort himself with childhood friend Mavis Pruitt, whom the town rumor mill believes is a loose woman. In addition to the themes of modernization (i.e., not enough demand for horse harness, and the impending arrival of the oil industry), Inge's characters all face one set of demons or another on their way to the film's conclusion.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ticket Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $25. Seating is General Admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each person is responsible for purchasing their own ticket.&lt;/b&gt; For reservations, please call the 2nd Story Theater at 401-247-4200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are interested, we will meet for dinner before the play.  Here are the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossroads Pub&lt;br /&gt;133 Market Street&lt;br /&gt;Warren, Rhode Island&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan on spending between $25 and $30 for dinner and drinks.  Cost of dinner will be handled as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinks will be consigned to a separate check from the meal.  Each person will add 30% to the price of their drink to cover the 8% RI Tax plus an 18% tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meal will be on one check.  An 18% tip will be added to the total and meal check will be divided evenly by the number of people attending the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send an e-mail including my cell phone number to all who RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. If you will not make it to the restaurant by 6:00 PM please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner is optional and is not included in the price of the ticket.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet-up Logistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fairly large parking lot located next to the theater between Market Street and Route 114 in Warren. A sign for Second Story Theater is on Route 114, although it's somewhat hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be just inside the theater's main entrance at 7:30 and will be holding a small MEET-UP sign. Seating is first-come;first-served, so please be prompt so we can all sit together. When you RSVP, I will provide my cell phone number in case you're running late or get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I've set an RSVP limit for March 25th. This is to allow time for me to get dinner reservations for those that are interested.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside front entrance holding MEET-UP Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Correia</member_name><member_id>8033800</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239923444000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236560422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Dark at the Top of the Stairs</name><id>9911683</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238283000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/9911683/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/global_6290483.jpeg</photo_url></item>
