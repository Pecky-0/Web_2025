They open their doors 3:00 pm - 7:00 pm with special exhibits, discussions, painting demos, live music, refreshments, and more- all in a casual reception environment. Maps can be found online @ www.artwalknewburyport.com or at the visitor's center when you arrive. This event is FREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote from someone that has attended in the past years; “ARTWALK has always been great! Some of the galleries go all out with refreshments, entertainment, and appetizers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be advised that this is a walking tour and we will be doing a lot of that. There is no set plan when finished with the tour- perhaps; Waterfront Park, the new self-serve ice cream parlor, the quaint lounges and restaurants, a walk along the water with some new friends, or take the 10 min drive to Plum Island and enjoy the beautiful sunset from the beach (whoooo).....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A SHARED EVENT with other meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

* WE WILL MEETUP between 3:00 and 3:15 pm In front of The Firehouse Center For The Arts. If facing the center, the bench to the left- by the shady tree, myself or someone will be wearing a meetup.com pin or have a sign. MY CONTACT # IS: 978.289.7679 after 1PM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; **Parking can be tight - so try to plan accordingly. Please consider carpooling with other members. It’s a great way to get to know someone new or travel with a friend. Just post your comments&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350915525000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley</urlname><id>1116818</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
