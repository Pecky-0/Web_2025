If you intend to borrow/rent clubs, you can let the pro-shop know when you pay for your greens fees - club rentals are $8.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All members are welcome; however, it may be worth noting that the majority of the group are at the beginner level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimum of 4 Participants (Non-organizers) by noon on Thursday, October 8th.
