We'll gather at the Henry B Burkland School, 41 Mayflower Ave, Middleboro, MA starting at 12:00 so that we can get organized properly.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pugs should be dressed in Christmas coats, sweaters, or collars (antlers optional), and I'd like to see each Pug decorated with at least one non-breakable Christmas ornament, plus some jingle bells.  Everyone bring jingle bells - nothing more fun than a pack of musical Christmas Pugs! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever has a wagon, please bring it!  It's always nice to have extra wagons for the old, slow Pugs. Don't forget to decorate your wagon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see all of our Puggie friends and their people there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291079278000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290045229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pugs March at the Middleboro Christmas Parade!</name><id>15484151</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290877200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/15484151/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/0/global_19713632.jpeg</photo_url></item>
