Well, it's time to head back and enjoy some good beer in the spirit of the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two levels to MeadHall.Â  On first level is the main tap room and bar. The second level has a nice lounge area and another bar. We'll meet at the second level lounge since it will give us more room and a nice area to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MeadHall is one of the best Beer Bars in Boston. It has over 100 quality beers on tap. It's located in Kendal Square not far from the Red Line T stop. (around the corner from the Marriott Hotel)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the link: &lt;a href="http://themeadhall.com/"&gt;http://themeadhall.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry the site is still under construction but at least it provides the address and phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone - Happy Holidays&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the lounge area on the second level.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>4878639</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355690195000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355195473000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Deck the Halls ...at MeadHall</name><id>94898392</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355616000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/94898392/</event_url></item>
