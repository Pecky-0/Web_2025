Today founding members Clarence Fountain and Jimmy Carter are joined by more recent arrivals Bishop Billy Bowers, Joey Williams, Ricky Mckinnie, Bobby Butler and Tracy Pierce on a mission to expand the audience for traditional soul-gospel singing while incorporating contemporary songs and innovative arrangements into their hallowed style, winning four Grammies along the way.  If their low rumble and foot stomping harmonies don't move you, nothing will.  Opening the concert will be local choir Mighty Men of God under the direction of Marcus N. Pitts  III from the St, John's Congregational Church in Springfield.  The UMASS Gospel Choir will perform in the lobby from 7:15-7:45.  I bet you will never be the same after this performance!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196638374000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195397590000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blind Boys of Alabama</name><id>6763777</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196465400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/6763777/</event_url></item>
