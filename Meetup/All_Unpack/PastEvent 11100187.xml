Now she expands this discussion for both men and women to teach us about 'The Spiritually Evolved Man and Woman.' How are men and women spiritually the same and how are they different? What does this bright future look like and how can we begin to embody it now? Come meet Mother Clare Watts, Priest, author, and national speaker as she brings the process of spiritual evolution down to earth and into the realm of possibility for anyone who wants it, male or female.
