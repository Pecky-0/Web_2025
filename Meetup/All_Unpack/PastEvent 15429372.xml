Don't believe me? Check it out &lt;a href="http://climbingweather.com/Connecticut/Ragged-Mountain/" target="_blank"&gt;weather for climbers dot com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to meet at CT Rock Gym in New Haven 9am and climb until approx 4pm at Ragged Mountain in Southington.  This IS a CRG sanctioned climbing trip for all ability levels and rental equipment is included.  Basic belay skills are recommended. Carpools may be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP through Meetup and SAVE $10 on the trip.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regular price is $35 CRG members or $50 otherwise.  A steal compared to other guide services charging well over $100 a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions...please call the gym 203.404.5166 or email Nate@ctrockgym.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely the last great weather weekend this season, we hope you'll come out!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate McKenzie</member_name><member_id>10557655</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289665266000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctrockclimbing</urlname><id>1388805</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>CT Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289596214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outdoor Climbing Saturday (Meetup Discount)</name><id>15429372</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289656800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ctrockclimbing/events/15429372/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/2/global_16959602.jpeg</photo_url></item>
