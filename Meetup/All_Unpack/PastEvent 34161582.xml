There is no better food in the North End today than by Chef/Owner Anthony Caturano. As such, the prices are relatively high. But this restaurant is as good as any Italian restaurant in and around Boston. The service is also excellent. If you like Italian, you should give it a try. The price ranges are: Appetizers $10-16, Entrees $18-46 Wines by the Glass $8-15. The restaurant is on the first block of Fleet Street. From the Greenway, walk down the right side of Hanover St. until you get to Hanover Liquors. Then take a right onto Fleet Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who arrive between 6:00 and 7:00, please join us at the bar for a cocktail or glass of wine. And, if you have a little more time, we will go for coffee and dessert afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
