Don't stay at home!  Take a nap, then join me for a late nite movie.  Cinemaworld in Lincoln, RI has a Cult Classics summer series every Friday &amp;amp; Saturday night for $2. &lt;a href="http://www.cinemaworldonline.com/melbourne/cultclassics.asp" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cinemaworldonline.com/melbourne/cultclassics.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cinemaworl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend Cinemaworld is featuring... GHOSTBUSTERS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinemaworld is located in/behind the Lincoln mall (Lincoln, RI).  I occasionally venture here to catch a movie, the theatre is pretty nice and gets my vote for cleanliness.  It is not that far from Providence--it takes me about 15 min. from the Eastside.  The easiest way to enter the theatre is to go past the Stop 'n Shop around to the backside of the &amp;quot;mall&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ghostbusters, well, if you somehow missed this classic... you really should come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my sanity, I am going to ask that everyone purchase their own ticket--it just gets too confusing if people cancel and such.  I will try to call ahead and post a message here to see approx. how many people these events attract and if there is likely to be a long line before the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to get my ticket around 9ish then head over to Chili's for some chips&amp;amp;salsa and a 'rita before the movie--if you want to join me (YEAH, you DO! :-).  Chili's is not connected to the mall, but, it is in that same plaza section across the mall parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet outside the theatre by &lt;b&gt;10:45pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This is my first event as an assistant organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will plan to wear a ridiculously long, goofy, pearl necklace that will likely not match my outfit. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily</member_name><member_id>9507307</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277529413000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277048440000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Late Nite @ the Movies: "I ain't 'fraid of no ghost!"</name><id>13854853</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277520300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/13854853/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
