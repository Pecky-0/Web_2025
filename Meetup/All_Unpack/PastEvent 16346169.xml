Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;strong&gt;get there early . . . even before 6:45 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the "staff only" signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box. Mass Ave buses (to points in Arlington and North Cambridge) originate in Harvard Square on the Red Line and travel along Massachusetts Avenue, which is about a 10-minute walk from the auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information and directions, go to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. (If you are in the separate screening room, turn right after you exit and walk toward the courtyard, then look for signs pointing the way to the telescopes.) You can also look for me and my meetup sign while we are waiting in line to look through the telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of exciting objects to observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Observatory Night&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, May 19, 2011, &lt;span style="color : #19294b"&gt;"Kepler Mission Update," David Latham, CfA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;NASA's Kepler spacecraft is searching the skies for Earth-sized worlds in Earth-like orbits. It hunts for them by watching for transits -- when a planet crosses in front of its star as seen from Earth, causing the star to dim ever so slightly. How is Kepler doing in its quest to find rocky planets that might be able to support life as we know it? Mission co-investigator David Latham will give us an update on the latest released results, as Kepler enters its third year of science operations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will go to the Algiers Coffee House, 40 Brattle Street, Harvard Square, if people would like to go out after the lecture (after the stargazing if the skies miraculously clear).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup sign.
