Meet some new sailing friends? Hook-up with skippers looking for crew? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then join our day of sailing and Scavenger hunt in the Boston Harbor Islands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday June 27th:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skippers with boats will bring a couple of new crew along from the meetup site. We'll have an informal scavenger hunt around the harbor islands (for example: take a picture of Hull Pt. Windmill while sailing through Nubles Channel...make it clear where you are) and then meet at Spectacle Island to eat and drink and see who wins the scavenger hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you would like to include your boat or if you would like to find a boat to crew on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Ya'll! This will be fun and we'll get to meet a bunch of new people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>More To Come Soon</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247872041000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245177144000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sailing "Scavanger Hunt" in Boston Harbor</name><id>10664761</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246118400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/10664761/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/1/global_9193873.jpeg</photo_url></item>
