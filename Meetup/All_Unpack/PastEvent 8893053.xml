We are also headed into peak foliage season. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.foliagenetwork.net" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.foliagenet...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be a 5.1 mile (round trip) hike to the Squam Mountains in New Hampshire. We will start from the Mount Morgan Trail off Highway 113 in NH. We will be taking the Mount Morgan trail for 1.7 miles where it coincides with the Crawford Ridgepole Trail for .2 miles where they split again. We will bear right at the fork for an easier hike up to the Mt. Morgan summit where we’ll have lunch. If you turn left, it becomes a more moderate hike scaling low cliffs on a wooden ladder, after which you crawl through a cave like passage through rocks and emerge atop the cliffs and then leads to the summit. We follow the Crawford-Ridgepole Trail for another .8 miles to the open summit of Mount Percival, which also has excellent views of the lakes. We will then descend 1.9 miles via the Mount Percival trail to Highway 113. After that, it’s a .3 mile walk back to the parking lot. Total elevation gain is about 1500 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike is rated as an &lt;b&gt;easy to moderate hike&lt;/b&gt;, about 1500 feet in elevation gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring along a backpack with your lunch, trail snacks, camera, sunscreen, sunglasses, extra socks, gloves, insect repellent, 2+ liters (64oz+) of water/gatorade, energy snacks, and extra layers of clothing as it may be windy/cold. Hiking boots are also suggested. Don't wear any cotton as once it gets wet, it won't dry and you'll be cold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet at&lt;/b&gt; the parking area at the Mt Morgan trailhead at 10:45. We will begin our hike promptly at 11:00. We should reach the Mt. Morgan peak a little afternoon for lunch, however we can also have lunch earlier as there's a cliffside view before the peak. The hike time according to book is about 3 hours which doesn't include stops for lunch and picture breaks so we could be 4-4.5 hours on this hike. The car ride is a bit over 2 hours from Boston. Carpooling is recommended.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transportation&lt;/b&gt; is your own responsibility. In this day of high gas prices and the long drive, we recommend that you carpool if you can to save on gas and tolls. &lt;b&gt;When you RSVP,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;please&lt;/b&gt; indicate whether you can offer a carpool and where you will be coming from. For those that need a  ride, please indicate your location or T stop you will be coming from. This will help us to facilitate carpools as best as we can. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the hike will happen at 11am, please make sure you leave early enough to get there on time. Total distance from Boston is about 115 miles. It is about a little over 2 hours from Boston without stops.  We will wait 15 minute and start the hike at 11:00. As this is peak/near peak foliage season, traffic may be bad so please plan accordingly. Speeding is also not recommended as there's typically State Police a few miles over the border and once they were around for quite a bit after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current weather for Saturday looks good. The weather is suppose to be in the 60's, but that's for the ground. Please bring an extra layer or two (i.e., long sleeve shirt and a jacket) as it may be windy at the top. Also pay attention to the map and wait at each intersection for a decent size group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt; From Boston, take 93N to NH, exit 24  (Ashland) onto Route 3 south. In Holderness turn left onto N.H. 113. The parking area is 5.5 miles on the left. There are no real landmarks prior to the turnoff for the parking lot so keep track of your milage once you’re on 113. You’re at the right parking lot if it says Mt. Morgan Trail. If it says Mt Percival trail, you've gone too far and need to turn back .3 miles. Parking is free. For those with FRS Radio's, we will be on Channel 8. Cell phone coverage may also be spotty.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Henry</member_name><member_id>7346155</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285975295000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223090277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall Foliage Hike, Squam Lakes, NH</name><id>8893053</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223736300000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/8893053/</event_url></item>
