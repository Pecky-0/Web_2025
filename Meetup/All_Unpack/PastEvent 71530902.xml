People who want to can meet at 830am to ride 10-15 miles before we all meetup  at 10am. My tel# 508 525 2719 if your lost, but I live in Boston area, so many of you will know this area better than myself, I've ridden this twice, so I know the parking lot of the road where the 2 low signs are telling you it's Blackstone Park. A lot of people have signed up which is awesomw, but PLEASE, get there at least 30 minutes early if you have to air your bike,tighten things or whatnot. I look forward to meeting you all on Sunday. I drive a yellow Ford Escape,and don't sweat anything just come for a nice ride!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342833924000</updated><rating><average>4.09000015259</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>41</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341165613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Ride Blackstone River 20 miles Round Trip</name><id>71530902</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342360800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/71530902/</event_url></item>
