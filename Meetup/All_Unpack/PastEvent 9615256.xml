Lots to celebrate? Warm up on a winter eve with newcomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll hang at the Cuban Revolution on Valley Street from 9 til about 11pm (they close at midnight). Then we'll move on to Lili Marlene's at 422 Atwells street just hop skip and jump away. This bar is quiet and a nice hideaway â€“ minimal signage outside. It's a stand alone building. Need to park on the street (don't park in the lot nearby you'll be towed). Coming from Valley Street it's just past the overpass on the right when you start to get into Federal Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to newcomers and you see a big group of people kinda congregating together that's probably us. Don't be shy, just ask and anyone can introduce you around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll try to congregate in the lounge area.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233799804000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233101462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Socializing + Drinks</name><id>9615256</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233367200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/9615256/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
