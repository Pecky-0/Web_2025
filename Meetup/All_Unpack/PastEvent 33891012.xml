&lt;p&gt;There are several trails in Dogtown.&amp;nbsp; We will follow trail #4 to locate as many boulders as possible.&amp;nbsp; During the Great Depression, Roger Babson commissioned 36 unemployed Finnish quarry workers to carve the mottos on the boulders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are now known as the Babson Boulders.&amp;nbsp; You will learn more about the Babsons and the history of the settlement during the hike. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR HIKING!!&amp;nbsp; Although this would be considered an 'easy to moderate' hike for serious hikers, be advised that portions of the 'walk' may be taxing if you have any health issues.&amp;nbsp; Please let me know if you need anything.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Guidelines&amp;nbsp;for safe&amp;nbsp;hiking... &lt;br /&gt;

 &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 We will walk at the pace of the slowest hiker. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will stay together at all times.&amp;nbsp; There are many trails in Dogtown and it is easy to get lost if you don't have a map. &lt;br /&gt;

 Bring water! &lt;br /&gt;

 Be sensible about your footwear.&amp;nbsp; No sandals please, unless they are made for safety while hiking. &lt;br /&gt;

 A walking stick could come in handy. &lt;br /&gt;

 Sunscreen/insect repellent would be smart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We LOVED this hike in July and said we'd like to do it again in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides learning some history and seeing the boulders, I love Dogtown because of the peace I feel there and the sense that time somehow is standing still.&amp;nbsp; See you on the 29th!! &lt;br /&gt;
