<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join me for a &amp;lt;2 hour walk through the Middlesex Fells on the Fire Roads.  Enjoy the beautful scenery from the comfort of the (relatively) flat dirt roads that surround the reservoirs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start from the Long Pond Parking Lot at 9:00 am (leaving no later than 9:10).  The plan will be to cut through the middle reservoir and circle back around the south reservoir.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are very welcome (I'll be bringing mine).  If you want to cut the trip short, feel free to head back early.  The pace will not be super fast (dogs get distracted and are distracting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice map of the Fells can be found here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fellsbiker.com/maps/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fellsbiker...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Long Pond Parking lot is # 13 on the map (on the Northern end of South Border Road in Winchester)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275749874000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275429721000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Middlesex Fells Fire Roads</name><id>13662920</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275742800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/13662920/</event_url></item>
