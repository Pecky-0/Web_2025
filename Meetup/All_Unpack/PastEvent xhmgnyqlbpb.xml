Meet in the visitor center parking lot then walk along the historic trail. &lt;span&gt;The organizer may not be present at every walk. but there is only one trail and there are bound to be several group members who have walked here many times before.&lt;/span&gt; MINUTE MAN NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK is located 22 miles outside of Boston within the towns of Lexington, Lincoln and Concord. The park commemorates the opening battles of the American Revolution on April 19, 1775 by protecting, preserving and interpreting the significant historic sites, structures, landscapes, events and ideas embodied by these events. This five mile trail connects historic sites from Meriam's Corner in Concord to the eastern boundary of the park in Lexington. The main theme of the trail is the Battle of April 19, 1775, that launched the American Revolution. Much of the trail follows original remnants of the Battle Road; other sections leave the historic road to follow the route of the Minute Men, traversing farming fields, wetlands, and forests. On April 19, 1775, British soldiers and American militia, "minute men" met in a series of skirmishes along a 22 mile stretch of road that ran from Boston to Concord. The American Revolution began at Lexington and Concord with a clash of arms known to history as "the shot heard round the world." Minute Man National Historical Park is home to many unique and interesting historic structures, interpretive walking trails and cultural landscapes. The park supports a variety of habitats. Forests are dominant, covering approximately 500 acres of the park, including about 200 acres of forested wetland. Non-forested wetlands, including several ponds, cover approximately 180 acres. Meadows and fields cover an additional 250 acres, including approximately 100 acres farmed under the park's agricultural leasing program. GETTING THERE From I-95: Take exit 30B to Route 2A west. Continue west on 2A for a half mile. &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/mima/planyourvisit/upload/MIMA%20Park%20Map.pdf" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.nps.gov/mima/planyourvisit/upload/MIMA%20Park%20Map.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344774925000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318353907000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Battle Road Trail walk</name><id>xhmgnyqlbpb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344695400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/36984832/</event_url></item>
