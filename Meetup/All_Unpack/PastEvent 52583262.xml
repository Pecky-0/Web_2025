<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;In case you haven't been paying attention, Washington County ME had to delay their caucus due to snow. It is being held this Saturday and, after widespread suspicion that the delay was intentional &amp;ndash; including from high-ranking Ron Paul campaign staffers &amp;ndash; it is critical that Dr. Paul not just win the caucus, but win by *at least 200 votes* to make him the overall winner of the Maine primary straw poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ron Paul loses Washington Co after the media hubbub that the election was 'stolen' from him, it will be reported as a second failure and could deflate his campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It is critical that Ron Paul win Washington Co by 200 votes.&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grassroots are scrambling to identify possible Ron Paul voters in Washington Co. We have nothing but the telephone book, but we can make this a victory for Dr. Paul!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a grassroots project, so you will be using your own cell phone to make calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact me for White Pages in Washington County, and CALL FOR PAUL!&lt;/p&gt;
