Wear athletic clothing, but dress for the weather.  Synthetic materials that don't absorb water are recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice will start with a brief warm up then we'll jump in the boats and start paddling.  New paddlers will get one-on-one training to teach them our basic paddling technique.  We'll paddle up river conducting various drills designed to improve timing, speed, power, and other aspects of paddling.  We will normally race our two boats against each other several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we return to the docks, we'll stretch out a bit before concluding practice.  Paddlers frequently adjourn to a neighborhood restaurant for a beer or ginger ale or two after practice.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We meet by the docks behind Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Parker</member_name><member_id>7135817</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365515798000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Dragon Boating is a great workout that anyone can do.
