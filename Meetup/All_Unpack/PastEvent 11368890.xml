(And full disclosure.... Oct 1 is my birthday, so I wanted to go out!) We're also celebrating Alex's 30th birthday, and Joe's one year anniversary in CT : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what I'm thinking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:30pm - Pacifico&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:45pmish - Prime 16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10pmish- Geronimo's&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11pm+ - ????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner had been originally suggested, but a few people pointed out to me the problems of trying to get space at BAR on a Friday, especially when I don't know who's coming for dinner, if we all have to be there to be seated, etc, so I am gratefully taking their advice and skipping an actual dinner (though I'm sure we'll snack along the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My number will be in my RSVP.  I left the 11pm+ blank because I don't know if we'll be hyper and ready to dance, or wanting to wind down and go to a chill place.  Give me a ring if you want to know where we are : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!! If anyone else has something they want to go out and celebrate, let me know and I'll post it : )&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You should be able to find me because we'll be in the bar area, and I'll probably be wearing a blue-green patterned short sleeve shirt</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254699392000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252948692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>**NHC does (Weekend!)
