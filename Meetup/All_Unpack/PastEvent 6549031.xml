We wondered how many other people were spending the holiday alone as well, and we thought why not spend it together?  So, if there is anyone who doesn't happen to have holiday plans, you are more than welcome to spend the day feasting and being thankful with us.  And, if everyone has plans for the day, then we are more than happy (and we'll spend the day in our PJs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will provide the bird and the pie but we're looking to others to fill in the traditional dishes.  So, in your RSVP, please include what you will be bringing.  If we don't have a large response for people who will be in town, we will most likely change the event to dining out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After eating too much wonderful food, we can spend the day playing games (most likely with football on in the background).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking should be plentiful and we are in the pumpkin-colored house.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196267903000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192391263000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thanksgiving</name><id>6549031</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195765200000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6549031/</event_url></item>
