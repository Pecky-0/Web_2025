This is also the place to check out the latest Hurricane updates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entertainment is fantastic for those into, well, Irish drinking songs and the like, with great artists like Seamus Kennedy, The Town Pants, and the Shananagans.  &lt;br /&gt;Check out the schedule at: &lt;a href="http://www.newportwaterfrontevents.com/newport-waterfront-irish-festival/newport-rhode-island-irish-entertainment.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newportwat...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are available online for $17/day or at the door for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested in carpooling, we'll plan on meeting a the South Attleboro Communter Rail station between 11:45-12 am. &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/stations/?stopId=193&amp;amp;lat=41.897943&amp;amp;lng=-71.354621" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mbta.com/s...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If folks are interested in taking the rail down from Boston, please indicate that in your RSVP, as we'll wait for you to disembark from the train at 12:00: &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=PROVSTOU&amp;amp;direction=O&amp;amp;timing=S&amp;amp;RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mbta.com/s...&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;Depending on how the evening in Newport pans out (dinner, beverage, etc) we'll plan to get ya back to the station for the 9 or 10 pm train: &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=PROVSTOU&amp;amp;direction=I&amp;amp;timing=S&amp;amp;RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mbta.com/s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those meeting us there, we'll plan to meet outside the ticket booths at 1:45 pm  As ever, will send my cell number to my yes's and maybe's the day prior so we can connect.  Will have the phone on from about 10-12:00 so we can connect, but it's impossible to chat over the music thereafter, so shoot to look for us around the center stage for most of the afternoon.  The delayed time has the schedule altered, but will mostly be straying to  hit the music tent for Seamus Kennedy at some point  If you arrive late, feel free to text to let me know, but please be understanding that I'll only be checking the phone after each music set ends.  We may also stray from center stage as the mood hits, but you'll definitely find me there at 4:45 or thereafter for the Town Pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will stick at the festival as long as the Guinness is flowing, and then likely catch some grub and more tunes amongst the Newport nightlife.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is cross posted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to it!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283626364000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283010986000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newport Irish Festival</name><id>14571861</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283622300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/14571861/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/2/global_17510018.jpeg</photo_url></item>
