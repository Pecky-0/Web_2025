I'd love to give Last Train to Wensleydale a playing as well, but we'll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP if you're in, and note the 8:00 pm start time. Since Linda won't be around, I'll need to make sure my son is tucked away prior to folks showing up for games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. And if you can't make this event, I plan to host a similar one on Saturday, Sept. 11. Linda's busy this weekend!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284167369000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284095027000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>14720702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284163200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/14720702/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
