The tour starts at Aroa and finishes on Newbury Street (about 2 miles and 2.5 hours).  The itinerary includes: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aroa Fine Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;South End Formaggio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lindt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hotel Chocolat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teuscher Chocolates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Piattin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Due to fire codes at a couple of locations, this event is limited to 25 people. The tour operator has graciously agreed to charge $28 per person, even though we won't meet the price break.  Please indicate that you are with &amp;quot;Nerd Fun&amp;quot; on the last line of the payment page so they can charge the proper rate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please purchase your ticket as soon as possible either through their website, Boston Chocolate Walking Tours, or by calling them at 617-955-2228 and then re-RSVP Yes and add a comment to that effect. I apologize for this inconvenience, but I want to respect the tour company and make it easy for them to give us a good experience! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we're not too full of theobromine afterward, I'd love to grab a bite of dinner somewhere cozy and reasonably priced.  I know very little about Boston so I welcome all suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the lobby by 3:00 and  I look like my picture.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267474651000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265393156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Chocolate Walking Tour</name><id>12528485</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267301700000</time><rsvp_limit>26</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12528485/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/c/0/global_12952800.jpeg</photo_url></item>
