Join us on May 12th at&lt;br /&gt;Pizzaria Marzano, a true traditional Neoplitan Pizzaria in Torrington CT. Wood burning ovens, fresh mozz cheese, San Marzano crushed tomato sauce, beer and wine (the second glass is only a nickle). Trust me folks this extablishment has been written up as one of the&lt;br /&gt;best new pizza joints in CT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE THE MEETUP TIME IS 7:30pm (Though I may be there by 7:00)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup is Hosted by Scott - his first as a host!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Ethnic Dining &amp;quot;Rules&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; you are expected to SHOW UP!!! Be polite and make sure you change your RSVP by 6:00pm the previous day if need be. If you have to cancel or want to add yourself at the last minute call the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Please bring cash, it is so much quicker and easier. Remember, no one leaves until the bill is paid - this is respect for the event's host and the other diners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I will collect $1.00 from each participant for Meetup fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to enjoy this one! - Betsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation under Scott/Ethnic Dining</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy</member_name><member_id>3384225</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>11796381</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273753487000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272655280000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pizzaria Marzano 5/12/10 7:30</name><id>13342541</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273707000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/13342541/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
