Our schedules (mostly Joe's) do not leave a lot of weekend days and we have a tendency to schedule the meetups on our availability. &amp;nbsp;We would rather have more convenient meetups for the majority of the group even if we cannot be there with Winnie. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Usual spot by the water.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kat Damaso-Azzarone</member_name><member_id>4421634</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307715215000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>English Bulldog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>engbulldog-343</urlname><id>537738</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester English Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305719411000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MAY MEETUP</name><id>18815321</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306681200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/engbulldog-343/events/18815321/</event_url></item>
