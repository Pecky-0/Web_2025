Back by popular demand, we had so much fun at our January Appetizer Social that we decided to run this event again.  Let's start off the month with a relaxed laid-back fun event where you can come and go when it suits your schedule. We'll be meeting at Bugaboo Creek which is around the corner from the RMV in Braintree, about a 10 minute walk from the Braintree T and less than 3 miles from Route 3.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bugaboo Creek has delicious appetizers and bread and great drinks, including their own custom Moose Juice.  &lt;i&gt;Plus, the SSDOMG will pay for up to 3 appetizers for the Group depending on the number of attendees.&lt;/i&gt;  As is our policy, you will still have to pay for your drinks, individually ordered food, any shared appetizers that the SSDOMG does not cover as well as tax and tip.  We will cash out between 6:30-7pm and start a new tab for those who might want to stay for dinner or to continue the Appetizer Social.  If you leave before we cash out be sure to consult a menu or ask one of the Orgs to help you figure out how much you owe and leave it with us so you can enjoy the rest of your Friday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will run for at least a couple of hours from 5-7pm or later.  With an appetizer social you can join us whenever you can get there, whether it be 5:30, 6 or 6:45.  If you would let us know approximately when to expect you in your RSVP Comments it would be helpful so we can keep an eye out for you.  Over 30% of members who voted in the poll stating how early they could meetup with us said they could be at an event by 5:30pm, with another 30% stating they could arrive by 6pm.  Since the bar fills up with parties waiting to be seated the restaurant has agreed to let us socialize around 2 large tables in the restaurant area behind the host station near the bar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a load off - it's Friday night and time to start the weekend off right!  Join us for an fun and relaxing Appetizer Social at Bugaboo Creek in Braintree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday Night Appetizer Social!&lt;br /&gt;Friday, April 3rd @ 5-7pm or later&lt;br /&gt;Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse&lt;br /&gt;551 John Mahar Highway&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;781-848-0002&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Organizer(s)&lt;/i&gt;: Angela &amp;amp; Mindy (2009 Annual Member)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Min/Max&lt;/i&gt;: At least 8 Yes RSVP's by 5pm on Wednesday, April 1st (no kidding!) / Currently no max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guests&lt;/i&gt;: Up to 2 per member!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Event Fee&lt;/i&gt;: Org Team and Annual Members - Free, Members and Guests - $2pp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Price Range&lt;/i&gt;: Appetizers, Soups and Salads range from $3 to $15, Entrees range from $10 to $28, and Desserts are all under $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cash Only Policy&lt;/i&gt;: Please bring cash!

Exit the Rotary heading towards the T station and get in one of the two left lanes.  Take a left at the first light so the T is now on your right.  You will go straight through 2 sets of lights.  After you round the bend after the 2nd set of ligths the entrance to the parking lot will be on your right across from a condo complex.  (If you go over the RR tracks you have gone too far.)
