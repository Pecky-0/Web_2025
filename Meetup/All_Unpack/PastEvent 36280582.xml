 &lt;br /&gt;

THE SCENE: That area of MA is very scenic around now.&amp;nbsp; I drove by the dam last week and the trees are very emotional.&amp;nbsp; While I've never been to the dam, I've heard from residents that it is scenic, and surrounded by easy trails.&amp;nbsp; I hope to do a couple of hours of art, and later take some time to hike the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: Small-sized groups demand flexibility, so please check your email the day of the event to ensure it is still on.&amp;nbsp; Often, when there is just myself or one other I cancel or change the time of an event, to suit the small group's needs. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

WHERE TO MEET*: Because i haven't been there, best case is to send your cellphone so we can stay in touch the day of the event.&amp;nbsp; Second to that, if you take the turn into the dam, we should be located at the first scenic spot. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

RSVP POLICY: If there are 3 or less artists RSVPd for the event, the event is subject to cancellation within 12 hours of the event. We apologize for any inconvenience. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

DIRECTIONS: Route 20 just out of Sturbridge Center.&amp;nbsp; Hard to miss.&amp;nbsp; There is a big sign for it. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

THINGS TO BRING WHICH ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN: &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mosquito repellant,&amp;nbsp; Paper towels,&amp;nbsp; Sweater, water, food &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there. &lt;br /&gt;
