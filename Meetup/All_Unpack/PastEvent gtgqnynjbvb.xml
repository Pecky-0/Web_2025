<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come join us in our continuing exploration of Advanced Energy Healing! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time we will view and discuss a talk by Ashayana Dean called &amp;quot;Getting Back Your Aliveness &amp;amp; The Power to Create Joy&amp;quot;.  This is not vague &amp;quot;fluff stuff&amp;quot;!  Everything is described in terms of your multi-dimensional bio-spiritual anatomy, so bring your notebooks and personal recorders! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although reference is made to a product called &amp;quot;Tangible Structure of the Soul&amp;quot;, this inspiring and joyful presentation goes beyond that.    Other topics include the mechanics of creation, and  how to restore your original capability for perpetual health and wellness.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Keylontic Science technologies, you can even heal the planet as you heal yourself!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some interesting revelations about our ancient history are also included, as well as the reason why Indigoes are here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional guests from a 6:00 PM hands-on Energy Healing Meetup may be joining in with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a good idea to check the website for a last minute cancellation notice before leaving. If less than three members have RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, there will be no meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do NOT park in the driveway with the &amp;quot;ULCS Clinic&amp;quot; sign. Instead go up the first driveway which has the Meetup Sign at the end.  Enter through the front door with the Meetup sign, and go downstairs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aalia Kusmis</member_name><member_id>7978464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349856570000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bio-Spiritual Healers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BioSpiritualWellness</urlname><id>1275951</id><group_lat>43.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>Bio-Spiritual Wellness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271912902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Getting Back Your Aliveness &amp; The Power to Create Joy</name><id>gtgqnynjbvb</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276725600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BioSpiritualWellness/events/13256268/</event_url></item>
