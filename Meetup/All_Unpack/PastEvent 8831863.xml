There is no organized instruction, but instructors are always available to answer questions, give tips and dance with you!  Everyone is friendly and welcoming, so please come ready to ask people to dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you who DO want a structured class, we now offer a terrific Salsa Technique class right before the meet-up, so you have new things to practice all afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Salsa Sunday Schedule:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00-5:00 Salsa Technique Class (For Beginner &amp;amp; Advanced Beginner Dancers)&lt;br /&gt;5:00-6:30 Open Practice and Social Dancing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW POLICIES!
