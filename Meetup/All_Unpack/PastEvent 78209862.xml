Start time is 2PM and can run as late as the players want to. &lt;br /&gt;

The newest 5.0 beta has character creation rules and a new adventure set in the Underdark. So players have the option of using pregens or creating their own characters (which they can keep). We are limiting tables to six players, but will add more tables to accommodate everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan J</member_name><member_id>10199663</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346125245000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345239832000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D 5.0 Playtest and Meetup</name><id>78209862</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346004000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/78209862/</event_url></item>
