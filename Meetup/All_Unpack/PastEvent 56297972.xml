&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Local 121 on Washington St. in downtown Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're approaching the end of March and soon the Collective will be enjoying more outdoor venues for the MNM (yay!). So as we leave the vestiges of winter behind and transition towards spring where better to go then at Local 121?!&amp;nbsp; Amazing dark wood paneling with incredible detail grace the entire bar area, coupled with the old-world charm of herald painted stained glass windows. It is truly a feast for the eyes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant side is very trendy and known for their locally grown eclectic mix of gourmet fare and house-created drink concoctions. Stylish and trendy yes, but there's something for everyone - you can even get a 'Gansett!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local 121 is a P-Collective standard and a fave for most not only for the MNM, but on the weekend too. If you've been already then you know and if not, this is another one to know about and let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;

 Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
