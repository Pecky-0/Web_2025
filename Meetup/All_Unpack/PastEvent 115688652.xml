Learn what happens on a paranormal investigation beyond the TV shows. Hear how an investigation is conducted, how we gather evidence using forensic science, psychological and scientific research, debunk the explainable, and present evidence when conducting an investigation. See how we develop equipment used in the field. See evidence that we have captured on investigations including EVP's (electronic voice phenomenons). We will also have equipment on display used on investigations. Meet the Founders and the crew members of The TAG Team Paranormal Society, and hear their experiences investigating. We will answer questions about the paranormal, debunk anomalies that can be explained scientifically, and listen to your stories of personal experiences. We are a team dedicated to helping the public understand the paranormal and help spirits if we can.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368235005000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366678726000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ghost Hunting 101: Learn Before You Look</name><id>115688652</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368223200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/115688652/</event_url></item>
