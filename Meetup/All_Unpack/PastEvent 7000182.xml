I have special news for all you nice folks! So put on your reading glasses (you old fogies, you) and read up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some of us may be a little, ahem, &lt;i&gt;under the weather&lt;/i&gt; on New Year's Day, I don't see why that should stop us from playing some (rather bedraggled) frisbee. Yes, some of us may more stumble than run around the field. Yes, some of us may very well still be inebriated from the night before. Yes, we will probably drop every other pass and all collapse in the snow after an hour. But doesn't that sound like fun to you? Doesn't that sound like the perfect way to usher in a new year? 2008 never looked so promising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that in mind, we have a &lt;b&gt;SPECIAL TIME&lt;/b&gt; that things are going down: &lt;b&gt;4PM&lt;/b&gt; at the ye olde watering hole, Cambridge Common. Yeah, that's right, frisbee while the red sun sets. That does mean the vampires will have to show up a little late, but sacrifices must be made in the name of frisbee. All the rest of you non-garlic-fearing friends (fiends?) should show up at the new time, which I will repeat here just to be annoying: &lt;b&gt;4PM&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we all pass out in the snow, we will wake up and go out to a merry dinner at one of the local establishments, assuming they're not all full of hungover zombies. We will eat and brag about how much we drank the previous night. And probably drink more. It will be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come one, come all. All you people with new year's resolutions like &amp;quot;exercise more&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;drink more&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;play more frisbee&amp;quot; should feel right at home! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abbreviated version: &lt;b&gt;4PM Cambridge Common, New Year's Day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your  friend,&lt;br /&gt;Chris&lt;br /&gt;781 301 1791 (drunk dial me plz!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Drunk dial Jim too! Or ask him for directions or something: 617-335-4191&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the glowing-frisbees and smiles.
