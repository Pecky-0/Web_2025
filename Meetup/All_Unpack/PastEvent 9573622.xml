<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The original topic for this month (a &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; look at options as an alternative to trading straight equities) has been pre-empted. IBD will be providing us with a guest speaker (Tim Reazor), who will present the 1st part of a 3-part series on understanding and using the CAN SLIM method. A Q&amp;amp;A period will follow, so make sure to bring all of your toughest questions, your accolades and your complaints about IBD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 will follow later in the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! &lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy working the laptop &amp; projector set up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237411066000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232583380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum February Meetup</name><id>9573622</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234998000000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/9573622/</event_url></item>
