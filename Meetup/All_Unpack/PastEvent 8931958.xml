I've confirmed that their Sunday services are still public. We'll be attending the 11 AM session, and will have a chance to see what their form of worship is like. Afterwards, there will likely be a chance to ask questions of Scientologists, and to learn more about auditing and the methods of Dianetics. Any question? Call me at 617-935-4951.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235658853000</updated><rating><average>2.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223582973000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Field Trip to the Church of Scientology</name><id>8931958</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223821800000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/8931958/</event_url></item>
