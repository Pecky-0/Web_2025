<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>In plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in boucl√©. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254581248000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247106513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Slip Slip Knit Night   - Wednesday Sept 30th</name><id>10835771</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254349800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835771/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/4/global_9564580.jpeg</photo_url></item>
