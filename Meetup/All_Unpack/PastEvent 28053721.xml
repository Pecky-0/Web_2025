Its fairly new and has some received some good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to attend either event or both, indicate that when you RSVP so that I have a headcount and can update details accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already an institution of sorts, Abe's trivia night is locally renowned for its question blend. It is also infamous for being the only place where the group hasn't come out on top.....yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on down as we make another showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying you aren't any good at trivia is no excuse not to come out. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every little bit helps and great conversation is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know your music, even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game starts close to 8:00 and runs for about 2 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt; **** Try to get down for trivia by at least 7:45 so that we can be seated. RSVP space is limited due to the size of the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any winnings will be applied to a future event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me with a meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>c</member_name><member_id>2264651</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1312938333000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312338442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ Abes (and maybe pregame dinner at Abyssinnia?)</name><id>28053721</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312933500000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/28053721/</event_url></item>
