Dress for the weather and the water. An extra set of clothing is recommended &amp;quot; Just in case&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry it is a real last minute posting. Please do not RSVP yes unless you are sure you can show up. I leave the house early and will not get last minute cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminder that PFDs are required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the junction of routes 13 and 119 in Townsend, go east on Route 119 for 3.0 miles, and turn right onto Townsend road. Access is 2.5 miles from Route 119 at the West Groton Water Supply District plant on the right. Turn in by the yellow fire hydrant, just before the Water District building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The narrow drive beside the building goes around back to the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From route 225 in West Groton, go north for 1.1 miles on Townsend Road to the access on the left.&lt;br /&gt;Entrance is just past the Water building and looks like a driveway. There is a yellow fire hydrant but all the hydrants on the road are yellow!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan L</member_name><member_id>7773139</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257867410000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257556863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Squanacook River, Townsend, MA</name><id>11816104</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257694200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/11816104/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
