You pay $20 (per hour) as you go to each lesson (on Tuesdays for now).&amp;nbsp; If you attend 4 classes, you can get the 4th lesson free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you rsvp'd for the May 3rd lesson and were a no show, it is possible you will be wait listed so that others that are serious have a chance to sign up.&amp;nbsp; The Hingham Country Club is near the Hingham commuter line so it is very easy to get to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY ANSWERED THE REQUIRED QUESTIONS, PLEASE DO SO AFTER YOU RSVP TO THIS MEETUP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The club has their own rackets, and the instructor will determine what your skill level is within the first 10 minutes. He will match us up appropriately depending on your skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we get more daylight we may change the lessons to 6:30 so that people can get there from work.&lt;/p&gt;
