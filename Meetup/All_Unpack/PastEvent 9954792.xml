Learn how to relate well to Introverts, Extraverts, Sensors, iNtuitors, Thinkers, Feelers, Judgers and Perceivers. Discover the odds of how differences and similarities can be a plus or minus in a relationship.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Due to the size of the studio, a RSVP limit of 34 has been set. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce ******&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce, M.Ed., has been teaching the Myers-Briggs for 13 years and has worked with&lt;br /&gt;couples, families, individuals, companies and groups to discover their Myers-Briggs types and&lt;br /&gt;the relationship dynamics between the types.
