This Sunday, The Conduit performs a sound healing meditation which incorporates the use of planetary gongs &amp;amp; Tibetan singing bowls. Feeling the synergistic nature of vibration can open our minds to higher possibilities and states of harmony, ultimately resulting in self-healing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gathering people together for sharing a harmonic musical experience can be powerful. Something uplifting happens when we come together to create a sense of community through sound healing. Join us as we reconnect our hearts and bring love to our planet through the transformational power of vibration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using sound as a healing modality, a Conduit sound healing session clears and aligns the energy centers to promote deep relaxation &amp;amp; renewal. In meditation, we will unify with our essence, our original self, by hearing  vibratory sounds that produce a quieting influence on the mind and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join &lt;a href="http://www.gongtheplanet.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Conduit &lt;/a&gt;and others as we meditate and connect with the sacredness of the universe through sound and vibration. A $20 donation goes to support the work of The Conduit and the Growing Green Co-op's healing arts space. Before the concert at 6 pm, Alchemy After Hours Cafe will be open serving juice, tea and snacks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about The Conduit, please see &lt;a href="http://www.gongtheplanet.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.gongtheplanet.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265758591000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264206662000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vibrational Sound Healing for Ourselves &amp; the Earth</name><id>12396863</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265585400000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/12396863/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/6/global_12748038.jpeg</photo_url></item>
