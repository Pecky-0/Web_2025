He hosts a variety of events each month, usually in downtown Boston, open to Boston Convivium members and their guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April's first event is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cocktail Party at the CharlesMark Hotel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, on Boylston Street.&lt;br /&gt;The hotel is located across from the Boston Public Library. As you enter, go straight to the end, turn left, and go up the stairs. The party is in the back room, and will run until 11pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in attending, please join the Boston Convivium group and get yourself on the event attendee list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonconvivium.com/apply/about/default.aspx?source=10012-00" target="_blank"&gt;Join Boston Convivium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please also RSVP to this Meetup event so that I know to look out for you at the event and/or can plan to meet up with you at the hotel beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;b&gt;*** For this Saturday's event, entrance for Boston Tall Singles members is FREE - Thanks James! ***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entrance to these events usually costs $20 (if you have not signed up for Boston Convivium and completed their required profile and event tag description). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attendance at this event is limited to a total of 70 guests, and several groups are advertising the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The closest MBTA stop is Copley on the Green line.
