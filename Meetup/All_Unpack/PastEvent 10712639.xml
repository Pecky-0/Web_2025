The slogan “Silent Majority No More” can no longer remain just a slogan, it’s time to show that we are NOT silent anymore. Make it sound like midnight on New Years Eve in front of every ABC affiliate TV station across the country. Make them send their reporters out to cover it live. Continue the rally through their news hour so our fellow Americans can realize how many of us share the same view. We know that this keeps you up a little later than usual however, a little sleep lost now is better than liberties lost later. Unusual times call for unusual measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our ABC affiliate is WMUR-TV right here in Manchester, NH.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a little impromptu rally is in order?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 9:00 PM (broadcast starts at 10:00)&lt;br /&gt;Place: WMUR-TV Broadcast Center&lt;br /&gt;100 South Commercial Street&lt;br /&gt;Manchester, NH 03101&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More here:   &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NH912Project/calendar/10701333/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246057880000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245720641000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stop the Obamanable SnowJob !
