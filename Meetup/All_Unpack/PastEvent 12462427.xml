Lighting to accomplish the artistic effect with the female body is the subject of this session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Models will be &lt;a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/1154401"&gt;Phylactere&lt;/a&gt; MM 1154401, &lt;a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/223676"&gt;Mia D&lt;/a&gt; MM 223676, and &lt;a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/716797"&gt;Melissa&lt;/a&gt; MM 716797.  These models will provide photographers attending with the exceptional subject posing seldom found in one outstanding session.  The studio is large enough so that each of the three models can be working with a different photographer at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To provide a good photographer/model ratio, this shoot is limited to 12 photographers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost to participate in this event as a photographer is $149; the cost will rise to $179 if not paid by February 9.  We reserve the right to remove RSVPs if payment is not received within a reasonable time after the RSVP is made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON'T MISS THIS ONE!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bert Halstead</member_name><member_id>6804860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267298662000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Photographers, Models &amp; MUA</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonportraitphotographers</urlname><id>830833</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Portrait Photographers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264805511000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lighting - Artistic and Lace:  A Time On Task Learning Event</name><id>12462427</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266080400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonportraitphotographers/events/12462427/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/e/global_12846974.jpeg</photo_url></item>
