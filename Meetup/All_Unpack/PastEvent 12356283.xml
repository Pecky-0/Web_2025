The cost of the show is $15.00 (I have to charge $15.76 because there is a 76 cent processing fee for using Amazon Payments) and includes dinner.   You can have a choice of Chicken Parmesan or Steak for dinner with all the fixings.  Drinks are NOT included in the price and everybody is responsible for their own drinks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to have to buy the tickets upfront, therefore you can only respond yes to this event once your have purchased the tickets.  If you would prefer to can give me the payment of $15.00 (amount less the fees) the next time you see me and I will change your status on the system to reflect that you are also going to this event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there  &lt;br /&gt;Ivone&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be holding a TFS sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130664000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263856978000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Comedy Show &amp; dinner</name><id>12356283</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264978800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/12356283/</event_url></item>
