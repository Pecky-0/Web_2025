I will cross-list this event on Craig's list and the Salem forums, and I will also post fliers at some local Salem businesses and Salem State (if possible).  If we have enough interest  we will definitely do a casual game of Ultimate, but even if the turnout is lower we can still do small-group appropriate games or just toss around.  If you have no familiarity with Ultimate or with frisbee in general, there will certainly be opportunities to learn, and I will make a concerted effort to keep get everyone involved.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Wednesday somewhat randomly, so if there is a better evening during the week or a preference for weekends, please let me know.  Otherwise, I look forward to seeing folks next Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a frisbee and cones and will be near the center of the common.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210012968000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ultimate Frisbee Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemfrisbee</urlname><id>666957</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Ultimate Frisbee Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209043752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Frisbee on the Common - First Meeting of the Season</name><id>7802897</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209591900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemfrisbee/events/7802897/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/d/global_2046557.jpeg</photo_url></item>
