Why can't we just go to church or to a yoga or meditation class and have a relationship with God through these means? Our soul longs to join the eternal flame of God within us. A true spiritual teacher takes us on our journey inward through our fear and turmoil until we reach the purest part of love that lives within. Until we reach this place of inner stillness and light, everything else is only concepts and ideas. Meet Mother Clare Watts, a Christian Master Teacher, and discover the steps it takes in order to find the right teacher and begin your path to enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;About the presenter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centersoflight.org/mother_clare.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mother Clare Watts&lt;/a&gt; is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 &lt;a href="http://www.centersoflight.org" target="_blank"&gt;Centers of Light&lt;/a&gt; in cities across the country.
