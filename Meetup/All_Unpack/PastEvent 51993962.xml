&lt;p&gt;i thought i would start off with a medium length game with a clear goal for you all to start with. then if you all like the game i was going to open the world up to the group and let you all roll play out the story how you like. with miner goals established from the first story. i don't know how well you know this game but it is going to run as an anti hero/ villain game where you all will ether play as abyssal (deathkights), corrupt solars (champions of the unconquered sun), and my be infernal (green sun princes). i have all the books as PDF just let me know if you need them. &lt;br /&gt;
