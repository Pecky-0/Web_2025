Don and Sharon will provide the turkey and you should bring a side dish from your family's holiday tradition.  After we stuff ourselves with turkey and are falling asleep with the tryptophan, we'll try to have our monthly business meeting.  At this meeting, we will be looking for nominations for officers for the coming year!  The election will take place at the December meeting.  Since this event is in a private home, you must RSVP to get directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the idea of having this be a costume party came up, that idea has now been nixed!  So, no costumes, unless you want to be the only one in a costume!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194569624000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191756317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Turkey Dinner and a meeting</name><id>6504532</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194130800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/6504532/</event_url></item>
