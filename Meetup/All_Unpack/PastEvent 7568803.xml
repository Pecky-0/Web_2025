O'Neil's CAN  SLIM approach.  All individual equity investors make some common mistakes as they learn how to become better at managing their own investments.  Specifically, these mistakes include buying subpar stocks in weak industries, buying at the wrong time, failing to cut losses, selling big winners too early, ignoring sound money management practices that maximize gains and cover downside risk, and, last but not least, letting lack of discipline and emotions preclude strong gains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William J. O'Neil has studied winning growth stocks and the characteristics that they all have in common.  Using this fact-founded analysis as a starting point, he built an approach and a database available in the Investors Business Daily newspaper and on &lt;a href="http://www.investors.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.investors....&lt;/a&gt; to help individual investors avoid the common mistakes, and buy and sell stocks successfully. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Investing is about playing the probabilities.  Thanks to O'Neil, we know what these probabilities are and how to use them.  In this series, you will learn what these probabilities are, how they inform your investing decisions and:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;What expectations and fundamental measures of company performance drive stock price and why they work. What information about a stock is irrelevant and should be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to use IBD's fundamental measures to find leading growth stocks in strong industries.  How to find companies with a sustainable competitive advantage within an industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to use chart patterns to know when to buy a stock and at what price.  When to add to your position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;When to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to monitor and manage your portfolio for maximum gain and minimum loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to interpret action of the entire market and ride the rallies.  What information about the general market is irrelevant and should be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to understand what to do during each stage of a complete market cycle (from bull to bear and back again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;What daily and weekly routines lead to investment success.  How to understand your emotions and their impact on your investing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a series of Wednesday Meetups, Mike Kinkead, a member of the Boston IBD Meetup group, will present thoughts on these topics and lead an interactive conversation about them with the IBD Meetup members.  Everyone is encouraged to contribute his or her experience to the discussion.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Talk led by Doug Roberts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug has delivered his Market Talk ever since we moved to MIT. The banter in our group of bulls versus bears has become vigorous as the market alternately rallies and tumbles. Join this discussion as Doug gives his perspective on fundamentals, technicals and sentiment. Doug is one of the leaders of the group and is a full-time trader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Basil Chapman, inventor of the Chapman Wave will be speaking at 5:30 pm.
