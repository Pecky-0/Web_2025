For $40 this course will allow us to.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn the basic elements of climbing safety, including: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Equipment: how to use a harness and belay device &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Knots: tying in with a figure 8 follow-through, plus a fisherman's backup &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Belaying: using a locking carabiner and ATC to confidently keep your climbing partner safe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Commands: how to communicate with your climbing partner &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking this course, most students can safely pass the MetroRock belay check, necessary to climb in the gym. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the details and get directions to Metrorock Everett at their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST REGISTER THROUGH METROROCK TO SECURE A SPOT &amp;amp; ATTEND!
