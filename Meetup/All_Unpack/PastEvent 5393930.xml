The question it seeks to answer is whether the inhabitants of a small town were part of the revolution before the fall of Communism in Romania in 1989&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; Sixteen years after the revolution that freed Romania from Communist rule, there is still debate about whether it delivered all that was promised. The buoyant little comedy &amp;quot;12:08 East of Bucharest&amp;quot; puts its finger on the problem in the best tradition of East European humor, savvy but concrete, gentle but sharp as a knife. Corneliu Porumboiu's first feature adds another voice to the growing ranks of interesting new Romanian helmers in this low-key audience pleaser for small markets.&amp;quot; Variety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film also won two awards at that other film festival,  Cannes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.floatationsuite.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=633&amp;amp;Itemid=45" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.floatation...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, I will be holding a Meet-Up sign near the front row and then off to a local spot to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1169683729000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168818577000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winner Best Film at 2006 Transylvania  Film Festival</name><id>5393930</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1169510400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5393930/</event_url></item>
