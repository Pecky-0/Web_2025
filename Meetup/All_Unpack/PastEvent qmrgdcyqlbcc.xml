&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://911expertsspeakout.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://911expertsspeakout.org/"&gt;Explosive Evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented World Premiere Tour of &lt;a href="http://911expertsspeakout.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9/11: Explosive Evidence – Experts Speak Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which began in late May in Beverly Hills and ran through July in San Francisco, was a resounding success, reaching thousands of people in 32 cities nationwide and countless others through live radio interviews and premieres that were live-streamed online. Many of the experts featured in this landmark AE911Truth documentary film joined architect/director Richard Gage, AIA, at tour stops across the country, as did family members of 9/11 victims and prominent supporters of AE911Truth. From the dramatic “Opening Night” premiere in Beverly Hills to the successful back-to-back screenings in New York City to the grand finale in San Francisco, the tour enlightened many attendees who were unaware of the evidence for controlled demolition and inspired supporters to take action and educate others.&lt;/p&gt;
