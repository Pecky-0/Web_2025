I bought 4 tickets for the game.  I am using 2.  So that leaves 2 for someone else.  Fantastic seats!  10th yard line on the visitor side.  Section 128 Row 5.  I opted to go for an early buy opportunity so I purchased these through ACE tickets.  This game will sell out fast so do not wait.  In past years, I have had no luck in buying tickets for a regular season game.  They would go on sale and by the time I get through to ticketmaster, they are gone.  Even via online.&lt;br /&gt;I will even save you the service and handliing charges.  The cost is $400 for the pair.  Get someone to go with you and it is $200 each.  PLEASE make you plan to pay up front for the tickets before you RSVP yes.  Last time I had to turn people down and reopen RSVP a few times, because people were not prepared to pay when saying yes.  So lets cut down on the email traffic and think before you say yes.  Much appreciated  :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tickets will be mailed to you once I get them from ACE Tickets</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Slammer</member_name><member_id>9179551</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285595289000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272909549000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PATS vs Bills</name><id>13369459</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285520400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/13369459/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/8/global_14809048.jpeg</photo_url></item>
