The 8:30pm Dining time is due to the fact that we are in the Private Dining room. It has two seatings and only the later one was available. For the most part Stephi's on Tremont has gotten great reviews on Yelp. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new restaurant with a interestingly familiar name has come to the South End. Stephi's on Tremont is the sister restaurant of Stephanie's on Newbury, a popular upscale restaurant that has been serving fabulous food since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Dinner we can choose to hit Stephi's Bar for cocktails or go to the Beehive for a lively Drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Street parking in the South end can be difficult, However the restaurant does have Valet Parking. The Closest T Station in the Orange Line Back Bay Station or the Silverline on Washington Street and a 5-10 Minute walk to Tremont Street will get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 All Participants of this meet up pay for his/her own meal, drinks, tip and taxes. Please bring cash as Stephi's would rather not break up the check for the table.&lt;/p&gt;
