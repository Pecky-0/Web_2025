This is loosely interpreted as tunes ranging from alternative to top40. He used to be scheduled on the 3rd Friday and now spins first fridays. This is typically a fun evening, good crowd range of age groups. This is of course an informal meetup due to the small space and larger crowd. But if you are interested in checking it out and enjoy seeing some familiar faces join in at any time of the evening. Music doesn't technically start until 11pm but some of us will be there earlier than that to stake out a spot, maybe grab a cocktail table.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322958535000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321577078000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday night downtown</name><id>41577822</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322883000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/41577822/</event_url></item>
