There are hints of Spanish, African, and Indian flavors in the food, which is usually a bit spicy. The menu here is very simple. Aside from a few American items like fried chicken, the meals are authentic Caribbean food served with cabbage, rice, and plantains. Dishes here are served in small, medium and large sizes. If you're really hungry, go with the large. Otherwise, the medium will probably be enough to satiate you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the jerk chicken, jerk pork, fish dishes, meat patties and exotic sodas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service tends to be a little slow, but the food is worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judy</member_name><member_id>5096147</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202664802000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199556119000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pattie Palace</name><id>7038372</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200528000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/7038372/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
