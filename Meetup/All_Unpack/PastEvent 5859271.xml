This posh, two floor club has a stage, dance floor, upstairs lounge space, and great DJs.  A great place to meet new people and to get your groove on!  All members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8pm in the first floor bar area of Troquet (140 Boylston St, next to the book store).  Troquet is a French restaurant located at 140 Boylston St, next to Commonwealth Books, by Emerson College.  We will head over to Mansion around 9:30-10pm to beat the lines.  I hear the lines at Mansion can be difficult, so please meet us before 9:30pm, as you may not find us later.  Expected cover: $15. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mansion is an upscale venue, so please dress appropriately.  If traveling by T, Troquet and Mansion are located between Arlington and Boylston T stops on the green line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
