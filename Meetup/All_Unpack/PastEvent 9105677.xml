We had a lovely beer/cheese/wine tasting there in May (&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/calendar/7717168/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;) and the owner, Jason, is thrilled to have us back! I'm excited too - Caseus has a wonderfully cozy feel, a kind and knowledgable staff... and good food and drink.  Caseus' motto is 'Every cheese has a story.'  Sounds kind of cheesy, right?  (Oh goodness... I did not even mean that pun.... smack me when you see me? Please? Negative reinforcement will be my only cure for being such a dork lol)  However, ask Jason about anything in his wonderful shop and you'll be persuaded - he has a great infectious enthusiasm for what he sells, and has obviously selected his wares with care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this event is CASH ONLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your contact is: Devorah (phone number in RSVP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason, from Caseus, has just emailed me with some great food offerings.  Caseus normally isn?t open on Mondays ? so it?s so nice of him to put together a mini-menu for us to purchase from! The offerings are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEESE BOARD&lt;br /&gt;SELECTED BY OUR MONGERS FOR SEASONALITY &amp;amp; PEAK RIPENESS ACCOMPANIED BY OUR BEST PRESERVES, NUTS &amp;amp; LOCAL BREADS&lt;br /&gt;SELECTION OF FOUR                    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARCUTERIE BOARD&lt;br /&gt;SEASONAL BOARD OF OUR BEST&lt;br /&gt;PATES WITH DRY CURED MEATS &amp;amp; SALUMI ACCOMPANIED BY MUSTARDS, PICKLED MIX AND LOCAL BREADS&lt;br /&gt;SELECTION OF FOUR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRISPY GOAT CHEESE&lt;br /&gt;GREEN OLIVE TAPENADE &lt;br /&gt; RED PEPPER JELLY &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POUTINE&lt;br /&gt;CHEESE CURDS, POMMES FRITES, VELOUTE&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TART DU JOUR&lt;br /&gt;PATE BRISEE, SEASONAL VEG,&lt;br /&gt;CHEESE , MIXED GREENS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRILLED CHEESE BITES&lt;br /&gt;OUR BEST MELTING CHEESES&lt;br /&gt;RUSTIC BREAD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHILI AND CHEESE&lt;br /&gt;NIMAN RANCH BEEF, &lt;br /&gt;MELTED XTRA SHARP VERMONT CHEDDAR &lt;br /&gt;TOAST &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POMMES FRITES  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>2956305</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>23</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227139666000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225977032000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>monday night drinks - anna liffeys</name><id>9105677</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226966400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9105677/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/d/a/global_6214826.jpeg</photo_url></item>
