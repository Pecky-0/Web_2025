Who knew? I sure didn't, not&amp;nbsp;until I tripped over the listing while looking for something else. (Note that is Scottish, not Scotch. Scotch is a drink. Scottish is an adjective.) IMHO, the British Isles wrote the book on breakfast, Scotland (whether it chooses to admit this or not) is part of them, and Jamaica Plain is about as close to them as I'm likely to get in the future.&amp;nbsp;Even though William Wallace (a.k.a. Mel Gibson) was not available to join us,&amp;nbsp;a Saturday Brunch (always less crowded than Sunday) seems like a good way to explore such exotic delicacies as bubble and squeak, finnan haddie, tattie scones, Scottish eggs (shown here)and lots more. I'm told the Haven also mixes a mean Bloody Mary and offer several various of "sweet stout," which is distinctly different from the drier Irish style variety (i.e. Guinness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, your reservation fee will be&amp;nbsp;applied to the tax and tip for our table and does not go into the Organizer's pocket.&amp;nbsp;Past experience has demonstrated that it's&amp;nbsp;just a better way to get people to commit to coming. (If we can get our full 8 attendees, I'll try to get Bob to wear a kilt! :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation is in Iris's name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333929427000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331826893000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Braw Scottish Brunch (Kilts optional)</name><id>56469892</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333814400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/56469892/</event_url></item>
