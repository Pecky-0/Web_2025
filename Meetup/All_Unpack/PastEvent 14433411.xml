At 2.5 miles, it was the longest private freight-and-passenger railroad in the United States. We will hike along the one-mile portion owned by the Manchester Land Conservation Trust, and on to Center Springs Park, which will take about 1-1/2 hours round trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the North End of Main Street in Manchester, behind Farr’s Sporting Goods, 2 Main Street. Park at the nearby shopping plaza or Eighth Utilities District office building; please do not park in Farr's parking lot. A special favor will be given to children who attend the hike, sponsored by the Connecticut Forest &amp;amp; Park Association's family ramble program, but open to all, especially those interested in local history. Extreme weather cancels. No dogs.
