And the promises of new breakthroughs could solve some of society’s most challenging issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However continued advances in biotechnology will require a supportive public environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Opinion Strategies and Peter Hart have conducted public opinion research for the Biotechnology Industries Organization (BIO) for over two years.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies will present an overview of their research on public attitudes towards biotechnology.
