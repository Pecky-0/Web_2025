Let's go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you haven't attended an event with us yet, then this is a great event to do so, you can meet a lot of the members/friends in a welcoming way!  So won't you consider joining us???&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People there is a LOT of information here, please read everything so we are all on the same page, it will take a few minutes to read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like breakfast we will not be seated until everyone is there, so please arrive on time, I have the reservation/Meetup time set for 11:30 but we won't be sat until everyone is there AND the room is available for us, please note that we may NOT be seated exactly at 11:30, but the restaurant will do their best to sit us when the room is ready for us, please be patient when waiting for the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read this to the end, as there are a few things that you need to know &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you RSVP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event has a few special rules, please read below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those of you that have eaten here with us before you know what to expect.  If the last time we went for breakfast here didn't work for you then please take that into consideration when RSVPing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We may not all be sitting at the same table, if there is enough of us we may get out own room, but different tables in the room, who knows you may be sitting next to your new best friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please bring plenty of smaller bills and some change to pay for your bill, remember one dollar bills are your friends, lol.  I have figured out a new (awesome) way for us all to figure out what our bill is, it is going well so expect that to be the way you figure out your bill. If you have used this before even you know how easy it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have RSVP'd for any past event and you were a no show, then you will NOT be able to get into this event.  This event/locationis popular and I really want everyone to be able to come.  But IF you have been a no show in the past, and want to come to this event then send me an email: msdondon2003@yahoo.com telling me that you plan on showing up at this event. Don't take up a spot that someone else could have had.  If you don't email and tell me that you are coming, then I WILL remove you from this event, and I won't send you an email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will be scheduling this on my 2 Meetup sites, so there may be more people going to this event then you see.  IF you are on both sites (Our Circle of Friends and Connections &amp;amp; Friends) then please only RSVP on 1 site.  If you end up putting in your yes on both sites I will remove your RSVP from one of the sites (ONLY your RSVP) also be looking for an email from me, explaining which RSVP I changed of yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have put a minimum amount of people that can attend this event, I MAY change it as the date gets closer, so be watching that you were taken off the waiting list and on the coming list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute now and put the Meetup phone into your phone, that way if you are are running late, can’t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, you already have it in your phone:     978-304-2811, please note this phone does not accept text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time for you to pay your dues?  Please look at your profile page where it states “Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer” You can pay your dues at any event.  Thank you in advance for paying your dues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAD Snow may cancel this event please remember to check back to see if we are still going to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a courtesy to everyone in the group come back to the event page and change your RSVP if your plans change or call me/send a message through the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you at Stephanie's&lt;/p&gt;
