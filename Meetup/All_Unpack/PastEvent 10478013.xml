As usual, the meetup is the third Sunday of the month. If you cannot attend because of Father's Day but think you can do Sunday evening, email me privately and if there is enough interest, I will have two meetings that day. We are back at Brugger's Bagles for this and the next meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminder: $1 donation is requested at each meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have the book on the table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1264377265000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243104561000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June Meetup: The Alchemist (Paulo Coelho)</name><id>10478013</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245610800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/10478013/</event_url></item>
