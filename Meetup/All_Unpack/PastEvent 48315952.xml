The winner from Jonathan's Lounge will compete against other winners in a nationwide contest with other winners from karaoke contests in bowling alley lounges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week until then, they are holding preliminary contests each Wed. and Sat., in which 1 finalist is selected each night. If you don't win, you can compete as many nights as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges are the dj and all previous winners who are in attendance that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those preliminary contest nights. There is no entry fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be regular karaoke both before and after the contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be competing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am listing this event for several meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
