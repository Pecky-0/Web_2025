The trail climbs the drumlin and esker, landscape features created by a glacier 15,000 years ago. We can also take a look at the huge rocks and exotic trees and shrubs that were part of a former arboretum. About 90 minutes - please bring yaktrax or snow shoes if there is snow or ice! Will cancel if there is a storm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO DOGS allowed here, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an admission charge of $4 for the sanctuary but it's free if you are a Mass Audubon current member. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From Boston and the south: Take Rt I-95 north to exit 50 and follow Rt 1 north. At the junction of Rt 1 and Rt 97, turn right onto Rt 97 south (toward Beverly and Danvers). Follow Rt 97 south and take the third left onto Perkins Row. Follow Perkins Row for 1 mile, and the sanctuary is on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the north: Take Rt I-95 south to exit 53A and follow Rt 97 south. At the junction of Rt 1 and Rt 97 in Topsfield, stay on Rt 97 south and take the third left onto Perkins Row. Follow Perkins Row for 1 mile, and the sanctuary is on the right.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Red subaru in parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234020460000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231708057000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary walk, Topsfield</name><id>9500166</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233415800000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/9500166/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/d/global_6592605.jpeg</photo_url></item>
