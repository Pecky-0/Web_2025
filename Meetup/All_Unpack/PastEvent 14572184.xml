My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules for Events with Reservations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at (617) 445-7549.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVPs are on a first come, first served basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO.

When a spot opens, your RSVP will automatically be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the event and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW if you haven't contacted me to advise you're not able to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I change you're RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update event confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within an hour of the event, it is counted as a NO-SHOW if you do not contact me of your change in plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email me (Tonya) about rejoining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so please, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will arrive 7:15 PM to to confirm our seating and welcome you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text my cell (617) 445 7549</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roberta</member_name><member_id>5678680</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287514497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283013362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jeveli's Dinner Saturday October 16th </name><id>14572184</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287271800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/14572184/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/9/global_17510809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
