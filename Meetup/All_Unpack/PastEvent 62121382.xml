This solo exhibition features her most recent science-themed paintings, all created in the 2010 – 2012 time period. The abstracted topics range from Bioscience and biophysics, through materials science, nanoscience, and high energy physics (the last are nerdly love letters to her neutrino-obsessed partner). April 29 at Athan's in Brighton. Talk at 5 PM, reception 6-8.
