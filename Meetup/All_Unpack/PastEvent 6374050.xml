You can find the movie at video stores, on Netflix, or in many local libraries. Bring food to share while we chat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A description of the movie is as follows: This film tells the incredible true story of a 23-year-old medical student from Argentina, Che Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal), who motorcycled across South America with his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) in 1951-52. The trek became a personal odyssey that ultimately crystallized the young man's budding revolutionary beliefs. Walter Salles's film is based on Che's own diaries of the trip. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret Vincent</member_name><member_id>1777042</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191452699000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190028305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tertulia: Movie Review of the Motorcycle Diaries</name><id>6374050</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191279600000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/6374050/</event_url></item>
