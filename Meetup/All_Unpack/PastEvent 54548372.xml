That's what we were thinking! Best Friends Pet Care is hosting a playdate for you and&amp;nbsp;your poochies. We allow any breed of any age, so long as your dog is friendly. We only ask that your pet is fixed and up to date on vaccines since they will be playing with other dogs. Our facility has a new indoor/outdoor area for them to be off leash to play and&amp;nbsp;socialize. We provide toys, water, and clean up so all you have to do is show up...and do you believe it? The meet up is FREE! There will also be refreshments for both humans and dogs to snack on. If you have any questions about the group please call: 860-721-8080. We hope to see you there and meet some&amp;nbsp;new friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>please check in at the front desk in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Pet Care</member_name><member_id>3611375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333402707000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>All Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DogLovers</urlname><id>448060</id><group_lat>41.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Rocky Hill "All Breed" Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330634004000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beat the Winter Blues...</name><id>54548372</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333213200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DogLovers/events/54548372/</event_url></item>
