<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Looking for hiking partners to head up the Lions Head winter route.  Want at least one other yes, but welcome as many people as want to come.  Must have ice axe, crampons, and winter hiking experience.  Whether we make the summit or not is entirely dependent on the weather.  If weather, avalanche conditions, or wind won't allow us to hike we will probably attempt another close by peak.  This is a strenuous climb, gaining over 4,000 ft. elevation in about 4 miles.  The Lions Head winter portion is steep.  Once again, must have and know how to use crampons and an ice axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions to Trailhead:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/lodges/pnvc/before-you-go.cfm#dir" target="_blank"&gt;Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check my profile picture.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238940222000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236894516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mount Washington</name><id>9942134</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238324400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9942134/</event_url></item>
