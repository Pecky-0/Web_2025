We will meet at Point Judith to catch the ferry to Block Island. You can bring your own bike or rent a bike on the island. After riding an hour-long ferry to Block Island we will go and rent bikes for those in the group that need one. For those that don't want to bike ride, you can walk to our first meeting point at Mohegan's Bluff (3 mile walk). Bike rentals are approximately $20 for the day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bike rentals we will ride to Oaks Bluff (South side of the Island and stop at the Lighthouse just before Mohegan Bluffs. The scenery is beautiful and spectacular. then it is a short ride to Mohegan Bluffs from the Lighthouse. We walk the 141 steps down to the beach and have lunch. see this link for pics of Block Island.  &lt;a href="http://www.blockislandinfo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.blockislan...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we will bike around the rest of the Island.
