<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Try navigating with a map and compass to find a series of checkpoints in lovely College Woods. Similar to a treasure hunt, in orienteering you locate orange/white flags in the woods whose exact location is shown on a premarked detailed topographic map. &lt;br /&gt;

Several courses of differing navigational challenge and lengths will be offered. &lt;br /&gt;

All ages are welcome! A great sport for the entire family! &lt;br /&gt;

You may start individually or in teams.&amp;nbsp; You may try to run fast or simply do a map hike. Instructions provided for those who need it. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I'm not doing a formal map and compass workshop this year, but I will be at registration all day and can give instructions, and help people chose a course. You are welcome to come and be matched with others if you want to go out in a group. &lt;br /&gt;
