He will present his recommended stocks and discuss why he thinks they have the most potential for price appreciation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul focuses on companies with the best growth potential, primarily in the rapidly growing BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, India, and China. All his recommended stocks are traded as ADRs on U.S. exchanges. He recommends stocks based on both technical and fundamental analyses, but he sell mainly for technical weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hulbert Financial Digest named Cabot China &amp;amp; Emerging Markets Report the top investment newsletter in 2006 and 2007, and since March 2009, it’s been ranked the top investment newsletter for the past five years. Paul has offered his outlook for emerging markets equities in numerous appearances on financial news organizations including CNBC, Bloomberg TV, Dow Jones Market Watch and others.&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to hearing Paul’s outlook on stocks in the rapidly growing emerging markets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To join our online discussion go to&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bostonibd" target="_blank"&gt;http://groups.google....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or send email to Jeff Orrik at orrik@comcast.net &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a friend you talk stocks with, bring them with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We strongly urge each person to make his or her own decisions about investing their money.
