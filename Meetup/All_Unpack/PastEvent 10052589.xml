Each class is filled with &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;calming, nurturing ways to enhance bonding and improve baby’s sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;During a Baby Itsy Bitsy Yoga class, babies enjoy yoga while on their backs, tummies, or held in loving arms. For parents, this class is a special opportunity to meet other parents in the community, and learn about baby's emerging personality. Most of the yoga we do in Itsy Bitsy Yoga is for baby, but you will also learn breathing and relaxation techniques as you practice a bit of yoga yourself. &lt;br /&gt;No yoga experience is required. Thank you for arranging just 1 parent/caregiver per family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Weekend Baby IBY Meetup Time: Saturday, June 27,  1:15-2:15pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost: $15/class (pre-payment required w/ YES RSVP)&lt;br /&gt;About Us: All Weekend IBY Meetup classes are taught by Alexandra De Collibus, Certified Itsy Bitsy Yoga Facilitator and Director of &lt;a href="http://www.AbsoluteYoga.net" target="_blank"&gt;Absolute Yoga&lt;/a&gt; in Hopkinton, MA.
