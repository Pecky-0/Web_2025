Those with an interest in possessing the item and benefiting from its power have sent agents to find it, but no one seems to know what or where it is. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Thesk for characters levels 1-4.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your characters from last time or if you want to create a character feel free to show up early, or use the guidelines on the RPGA site to create one before hand!  Just be ready to play at 11!  There is a Patriots game at 4pm that day so we are going to start an hour early this time at 11am and we will be done by 3pm. I have RPGA membership cards for anyone who needs one, there will be punch and chips to snack on as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time we had two guests not show up so no guests are allowed this time, if you want to reserve a spot then create an account please.  This way we can track who is RSVPing but not showing up.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the 6-3 bald dude.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Szewczyk</member_name><member_id>4695834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225036737000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219197231000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms Game Day 02</name><id>8580957</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221404400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/8580957/</event_url></item>
