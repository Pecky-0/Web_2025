It is very important that you play the character you have been assigned for the party to go well. Thank you!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other night in the library, when many characters were out of their books enjoying a sojourn in the night air, a crime was committed, grim and grave, right in our own library. As a result his Majesty Henry VIII – that&lt;br /&gt;famous monarch from the English history books – has disappeared. Gathered are the characters who were present in the library at the time of the nasty deed. Fortunately Master Sherlock Holmes is here to investigate, so the perpetrator of this heinous crime will no doubt be revealed as the night proceeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characters:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;br /&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;br /&gt;Cinderella&lt;br /&gt;Snow White&lt;br /&gt;Pinocchio&lt;br /&gt;Robin Hood&lt;br /&gt;Little Red Riding Hood&lt;br /&gt;Goldilocks&lt;br /&gt;Aladdin&lt;br /&gt;Dracula&lt;br /&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277660684000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264685808000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Murder Mystery Party - Mystery in the Library</name><id>12448338</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276984800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Out-and-About-Group/events/12448338/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/2/7/global_11644135.jpeg</photo_url></item>
