Join us at 8 for munch and chat. Get to know other members of the group, we have had lots laughs and met some really great singles. The band starts around 9 and the place is hoppin' so boogie on down and don't forget to RSVP so we can try to get enough tables and chairs.&lt;br /&gt;Rampage Trio is a high energy blues/rock band.&lt;br /&gt;cdbaby.com/rampagetrio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Longtime gig veterans Brian Owens on vocals &amp;amp; guitar, Eric Yanaway on bass guitar and Kevin &amp;quot;KC&amp;quot; Crowley on vocals &amp;amp; drums are stompin' around New England every weekend.
