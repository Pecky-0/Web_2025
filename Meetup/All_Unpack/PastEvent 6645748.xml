I'll be at Mezcal starting at 6 pm. Everything you bring will make a huge difference at a time where there are massive food shortages. Thanks for your help!! ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE: We are going to do a food drive at this Monday's Happy  Hour.  As we move into winter, now is the time that the soup kitchens need a lot of donations. Please bring nonperishable items to the happy hour at  Mezcal. Always good items to bring are cereals, peanut butter, canned vegetables, soups, etc. Jeanie has graciously volunteered to collect the items and bring them to the soup kitchen on Tuesday (Thanks, Jeanie!!!). Just taking a few minutes at the store and spending a few dollars -like what you would spend on one drink- will help a lot of people in need out!! Thank you for your support.
