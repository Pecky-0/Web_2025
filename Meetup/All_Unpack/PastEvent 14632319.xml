Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;b&gt;Get there early . . . even before 6:45 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served and admission is free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the &amp;quot;staff only&amp;quot; signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box. Mass Ave buses (to points in Arlington and North Cambridge) originate in Harvard Square on the Red Line and travel along Massachusetts Avenue, which is about a 10-minute walk from the auditorium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and directions, go to &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/public_events.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvar...&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A line forms early for this event. No need to cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. At this point, we can collect everyone from the lecture hall and the overflow viewing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the CfA: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Beyond UFOs: The Search for Extraterrestrial Life and its Astonishing Implications for our Future,&amp;quot; Jeffrey Bennett&lt;br /&gt;Is there really life beyond Earth? Astronomer and author Jeffrey Bennett will talk about why this question has become a hot topic of scientific research, and discuss how scientists are searching both for microbial life and extraterrestrial intelligence. Along the way, we'll also see why the possibility of life beyond Earth has profound implications to the future of our species, even in the unlikely event that we are alone in the universe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/images/sept10.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup sign. then sitting in back left of hall. then meet in courtyard after lecture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>74173</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marianne</member_name><member_id>9387943</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284858274000</updated><rating><average>4.55000019073</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>47</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283440412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory: Lecture and Stargazing Open to the Public</name><id>14632319</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284677100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14632319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/1/global_17076769.jpeg</photo_url></item>
