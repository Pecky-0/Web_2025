Their populations have risen in recent years due to nesting boxes! We are inviting you to help clean and install 30 Eastern bluebird nesting boxes for the MSSF Wildlife Management Area and surrounding spots within the forest. Meet at the MSSF Headquarters picnic tables at 10:00 AM, Sunday, March 18th. We will carpool to Cutter Field RD and a few other prime real estate spots. Volunteers are needed to help monitor Eastern bluebird boxes for the season as well. If you'd like to learn how to monitor bluebird nests, send an email to madshamel@gmail.com We will be holding a monitoring training meeting very soon. If you can't make this meeting, you can help native birds by setting up a birdhouse in your own yard. PLEASE BRING WORKGLOVES, a phillips head screwdriver and dress warm since we will be outside.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa </member_name><member_id>9473646</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332265011000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329153211000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nest box installation for bluebirds</name><id>52174012</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332079200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/52174012/</event_url></item>
