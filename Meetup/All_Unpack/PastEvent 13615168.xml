On April 10 we watched and discussed the first hour of the PBS video “From Jesus to Christ,” which seemed to present a rather accepting, conventional view of the Jesus story. On May 15, by contrast, we began to find problems with this view as we watched the second hour, which pointed out that during the 40-year “silent period” after the death of Jesus the only recorded “witness” to Jesus was Saul/Paul of Tarsus, the Jewish Roman citizen who first persecuted Jesus’ followers and then preached a kind of disembodied Jesus, revealing that Paul himself had never known Jesus as a personal, living human being. We also saw another film that advanced a frankly negative viewpoint rejecting the idea of Jesus as a real person. In our third session we’ll examine psychological effects of the Roman destruction in 70 CE of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, and then compare line for line the first Gospel (“Good News”) of “Mark” that followed it with those of “Matthew” and “Luke” that came after it—always asking what evidence, if any, for Jesus as a historical person we can reliably derive from the available documentation. Even if you’ve missed the first two sessions, you’ll learn a lot. Come and bring a friend!
