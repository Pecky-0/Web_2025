I've talked with the parks manager and gotten a trash drop off point. People seem to leave trash in places that already have trash so if we can get it clean now , it will stay cleaner and more enjoyable for longer.  The more the merrier so I hope you can come along and help make it a nice place to be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things to be aware of:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cape Elizabeth is a hotbed for deer ticks, be careful in the underbrush.&lt;br /&gt;- Poison ivy can be a problem, be careful in the underbrush.&lt;br /&gt;- Robert has yet to see a needle at this park, however if we see one, we'll make a note of the the location, notify the appropriate people, and leave it there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Please bring work gloves and trash bags.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beach at ships cove near playground at Ft Williams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who RSVPs yes will get a e-mail from Robert on Friday.
