Please take note - it's now posted for Blue Back.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1977, three years after the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) selects British TV personality David Frost (Michael Sheen) to conduct a one-on-one, exclusive interview. Though Nixon believes it will be easy to snowball Frost, and Frost's own team doubts their boss can stand up to the former president, what actually unfolds is an unexpectedly candid and revealing interview before the court of public opinion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Frank Langella, Michael Sheen, Kevin Bacon, Rebecca Hall, Toby Jones, Matthew MacFadyen, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: Ron Howard &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...perhaps the best work of [Ron Howard's] career...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Kenneth Turan&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Langella and Sheen originated these roles in the play by Peter Morgan (who also wrote the screenplay) and translate them to the screen with awe-inspiring deftness.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...tries to cast him as something of a tragic victim of his own limitations and foibles...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Variety&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Todd McCarthy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby.
