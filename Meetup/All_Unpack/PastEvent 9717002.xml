We went over the medications that are now considered (by a recent study of Fibromyalgia users) to be the best and worst for Fibromyalgia.  The study indicates which meds cause the least side effects and the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This next meeting I will spend some time going over the basics of a detoxification plan that will help your body to heal more efficiently.  I will come armed with &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; ways to do this and for those who like the easy way out and can afford to buy products the ones I believe work the best for Fibromyalgia sufferers either because they are targeted for the condition or work best for pain sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small donations are greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242170383000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234314650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia March Meetup</name><id>9717002</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237330800000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/9717002/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
