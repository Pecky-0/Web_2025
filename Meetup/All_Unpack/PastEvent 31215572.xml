&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Avery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, hopefully the hurricane aftermath will be behind us, and although a water venue would be perfect for a summer evening, higher and drier ground may be in order this Monday in particular - and so, we're going to the Avery!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Avery is by far the best reviewed bar in all of Providence and recently voted #1 Best Bar in all of Providence by the readers of the The Phoenix for 2011. Its a very cool bar in a neighborhood setting over on the West side and its an understatement to say its a favorite of many P-Collective members. Its cool relaxed interior has low lighting and nostalgic details. Its a real, bar-bar - and a perfect refuge from the storm.&amp;nbsp; They don't serve food, so make sure you stop for a snack before heading over. If you haven't been yet, then its worth checking out and if you've already been.....well....yey! - we're going to the Avery! So let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who have never been - The Avery is kind of on a corner intersection where Vinton St. dead ends into the intersection of Carpenter and W. Fountain streets. Vinton St. is off Broadway on the West Side of Providence. Click on the link for the Avery above and Google has a decent map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.
 &lt;br /&gt;Ever. Not even hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It won't be hard ... I'll have a flshlight!
