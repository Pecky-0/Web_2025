Our speaker will be discussing women's financial issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light snacks will be served.  Please bring your business cards for a raffle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that we'll be in the same building as before (in Newton -- right off the Pike) but in a nicer room, upstairs.  So please enter the FRONT door; not the back, side door.  There will be signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture on the site.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen K.</member_name><member_id>3407018</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207079011000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>You'll have the opportunity to meet career women like you who want to support each other.
