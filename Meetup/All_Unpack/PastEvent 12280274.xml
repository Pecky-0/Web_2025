If there's ice, we'll skate.  If there's snow, we'll sled.  If we're really lucky and there's both snow and ice, we get to do both!  You'll have to bring your own skates, but Gloria says she has a collection of sleds to serve us all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Don says we can have a bonfire, so bring some marshmallows for the fire, and maybe a thermos of your favorite beverage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don and Sharon live in Hebron.  Since this is a private home, you must RSVP for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Option 3 or Plan B, whatever you want to call it...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we're having a February thaw, Gloria will plan a hike and list the details back here a day or two in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266257459000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263163539000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outdoor Winter Fun</name><id>12280274</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266084000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/12280274/</event_url></item>
