I won't be doing organized stretches, but it's a good idea to do some on your own before you hit the court.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spring has sprung and it is time to get back outdoors!  Join players of all levels as we work on our swing, serve, volleys, and other tennis skills.  We are here to have fun and get back in the swing of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School offers plenty of opportunity to play tennis on its 6 tennis courts and two practice backboards.  Courts are available for up to 2 hours.  The BHS Tennis Teams and those w/ permits have priority over residents who all have priority over non-residents.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please Note: This is NOT instructional.  Therefore, you should have a basic knowledge of the game, how to use the racket, know the rules and know how to volley.  Ideally, you should be at least a 2.0 NTRP Rating or Advanced Beginner.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THU, May 6th, 2010 @6:15PM-8PM&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School Tennis Courts&lt;br /&gt;128 Town Street&lt;br /&gt;(Enter off Franklin St/Route 37)&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meeting Place&lt;/i&gt;: Tennis courts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Event Organizer(s)&lt;/i&gt;: Chandra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Min/Max&lt;/i&gt;: Max of 14 people.
