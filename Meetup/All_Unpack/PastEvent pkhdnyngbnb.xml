I am glad to see that we have had lots of people participating in our meet ups and everyone seems to be having a blast! The next meet up will be held on March 13th from 1:00 - 3:00pm. Whether permitting, we can either have the meet up inside or outside. Hope to see everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know prior to the 9th and we can schedule an appointment with a 25% off discount. If you have any questions give me a call or send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273342021000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268507335000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs April Meetup</name><id>pkhdnyngbnb</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270918800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/12867744/</event_url></item>
