I have yet to become a mean leader/organizer, and, well, I really hate making rules.  Thusly and therefore, please yield to my requests to change RSVP's accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And again I say, please:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my humble gratitude, and hopes for merry reading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the book on the table and my anxious face counting chairs :-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269013732000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265231903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers: Villette by Charlotte Bronte</name><id>12510589</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268265600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/12510589/</event_url></item>
