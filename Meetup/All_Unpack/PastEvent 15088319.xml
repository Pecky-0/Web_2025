When a woman who has raised her daughter to not believe in fairy tales such as the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus hires a homeless man to play Santa, she gets more than she bargains for.  After the man is institutionalized as insane because he claims to really be Santa Claus, the young lawyer whom the woman has been dating decides to defend him by arguing in court that he is the real thing.  And he receives help from a very surprising source.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291674543000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286918970000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Miracle on 34th Street" - Cine Classics at Cinema City at the Palace</name><id>15088319</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291563900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/15088319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
