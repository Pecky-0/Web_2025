Short notice, but......let's go! This is from the Tupelo Music Hall website: Melanie Safka first attracted national attention when she stepped onto the stage at Woodstock---yes, the real Woodstock. The summer of '69. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Who and so many others---including a young, gifted singer-songwriter, simply known as Melanie. As dawn broke, and rain began to fall, she performed on a stage that transformed a generation and changed music forever. And it was here where Melanie launched a legendary career that now spans more than 40 years.
