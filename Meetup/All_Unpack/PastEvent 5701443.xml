The circular structure of the film is determined by the accident which, although unimportant in itself, is a beginning and an end of the emotional turmoil which permeates the lives of all six of them. This psychological turbulence is skillfully veiled by the aristocratic climate of Oxford&amp;quot;  Edinburgh Univ.
