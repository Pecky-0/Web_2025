I plan on hosting some games this night for those that wish to not be alone just in case it all goes to hell in a hand basket.  For those that don't think anything will happen, well you can come up and game too just for the hell of it then!  Hope to see you there - games start at 5:00pm and will go to whenever people want to leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joey</member_name><member_id>9571736</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356538366000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355752563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of Days Gaming Get Up</name><id>95646192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356127200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/95646192/</event_url></item>
