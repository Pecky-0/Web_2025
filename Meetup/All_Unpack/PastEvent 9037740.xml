At the same time, the film addresses the problems suburbia faces in the wake of World Peak Oil in a lifestyle built on an ever-increasing supply of fossil fuels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, we'll be discussing Peak Oil and Climate Change and the position Portland may find itself in as these 2 issues start to play a bigger role in our community.  Cookies and Coffee, Tea will be provided...who needs a better reason to come?!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Not far from marginal way, near Sunny Breeze</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>matt</member_name><member_id>7777036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227224101000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>TT'rs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>TI-Portland</urlname><id>1233823</id><group_lat>43.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2900009155</group_lon><name>Tohidu Transition - Portland Maine</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225077703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Film Screening: The End of Suburbia</name><id>9037740</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226014200000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/TI-Portland/events/9037740/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/5/global_6050949.jpeg</photo_url></item>
