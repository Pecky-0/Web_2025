BYOB, same thing for food.  It looks like the coverage will run from 8:30 to 11:30.  Different sports will be mixed in including Lindsey Vonn attempt at gold in the Womens downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we get a large turnout we will move the &amp;quot;The Precinct Bar&amp;quot; which is walking distance from my apt.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>doorbell does not work.
