The orignal entry was the once put in by the systems as I didn't schedule this meeting ;-) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had originally planned a meeting primarily around a few homebrews that some of our members had been working on, but I'd be interested who else has something to add. This meetup group is in it's experimental stage to see if there is enough interest and a different audience from the Fellowship to justify a separate meetup group. I'm open to any comments or suggestions. For now I'll double post this event on both meetups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to join let us know what you'd like to talk about, if you have a game you're working on or what your hoping to get out of a meeting of the minds with fellow game designers. E-mail me if you have questions, ideas or suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just knock, I live there ... :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christian Loidl</member_name><member_id>1035154</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256194129000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Game-Designer-Guild</urlname><id>1421413</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Game Designer Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238380125000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Designer Guild Spring Meetup</name><id>10066624</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242500400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Game-Designer-Guild/events/10066624/</event_url></item>
