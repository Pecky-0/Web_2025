Even post-primary there are large masses of residents that have never heard Dr. Paul's message. We're still waking people up and gaining new meetup members who are excited by what they are hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your signs / stickers / handouts &amp;amp; enthusiasm as we show the "Constitution" state what a constitutionalist looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has always been a long-term process, and the seeds we plant now will grow into increased support for Liberty and a better educated populous in the near future. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;This is how we win&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; If you look at Ron Paul's CT primary results from 2012 and compare them to 2008 - he tripled his percentages. We need to maintain forward momentum and positivity so we can achieve our goal of returning to a limited government accountable to the people, while continuing to build our CT network of supporters for future town and state actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
