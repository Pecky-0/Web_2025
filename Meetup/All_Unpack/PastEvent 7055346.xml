Smith's trumpet performance is not a mere accompaniment to Fenz's film but rather an attempt by the artists to create a &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; that grows out of the combination of disciplines, with neither sound nor image subjugated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wadada Leo Smith is a multi-instrumentalist, composer and master improvisationalist whose forty-year career has included performances and recordings with legendary musicians Anthony Braxton, Don Cherry, Jack Dejohnette and Cecil Taylor. An influential composer and teacher of African American Improvisation at Cal Arts, Smith is also known for his work developing a unique music notation system and compositional theory known as &amp;quot;Ankhrasmation.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Fenz is among the more exciting and original young filmmakers working in and against the avant-garde tradition today. He shoots principally in black and white 16mm. Fenz's films have a rare energy and restless beauty that recalls both the jazz-inspired imagery of New York School photographers such as Roy DeCarava and Aaron Siskin and the landscape films of Fenz's former teacher, Peter Hutton. An inveterate traveler, Fenz has made films in Cuba, Mexico, Brazil and, more recently, India and France. He has also worked as a cinematographer on several films including Chantal Akerman's LÃ -Bas and From the Other Side. He is currently working on an ambitious film that engages the cinematic legacy of pioneering documentarian and HFA founder, Robert Gardner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film notes adapted from text by Jennette Montalvo.
