The meetup will hold at the Clear Conscience Caf√© in Central Sq like usual. If there are too many people come and no seat left in the coffee shop, then I will try to negotiate with the grocery store manager to see if we can rent their community room at upstairs in the back of the grocery store. So, if you come late and don't see us in the coffee shop, then please find us in a back room above the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will practice daily conversation in Mandarin. We may have Language Exchange in small groups if there are more than 10 people sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL LEVELS WELCOME!!! Feel free to bring books, course work, or anything you want to share with the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zhan</member_name><member_id>14049881</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336102655000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335490920000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Chinese/English Language Exchange Group </name><id>62329642</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335997800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/62329642/</event_url></item>
