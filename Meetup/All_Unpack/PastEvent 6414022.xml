One School at a Time&lt;br /&gt;by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From barnesandnoble.com:&lt;br /&gt;On the afternoon of September 2, 1993, Greg Mortenson realized that he had failed in his attempt to climb K2, the world's second-highest mountain. But disappointment was the least of his problems. Emaciated, exhausted, thoroughly disoriented, and suffering from edema, his grip on life was loosening. He was taken in and nursed back to health by the impoverished populace of a remote Pakistani village. Grateful, he promised to return someday to build them a school. Three Cups of Tea is the story of that promise and the story of how one man changed the world, one school at a time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing many of you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sabina</member_name><member_id>1638720</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193775078000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190581538000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Brookline Book Club October Meetup</name><id>6414022</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193601600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/6414022/</event_url></item>
