It is playing at the Liberty Tree Mall stadium Seating theater. I already saw the movie in previews and thought it was amazing not that I am biased or anything but my cousin Tom Kitt orchestrated the whole vocal arrangements for the movie. He also did American Idiot on Broadway as well as winning the Pulitzer Prize for Next to Normal. The movie has an amazingly talented and funny cast all of whom can totally sing Pitch Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the food court by Dunkin Donughts at 715 to grab a slice before the movie</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Brown</member_name><member_id>8675153</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy Blum</member_name><member_id>8796666</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350060376000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349299964000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday night flick Pitch Perfect in Danvers</name><id>85364772</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350000900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/85364772/</event_url></item>
