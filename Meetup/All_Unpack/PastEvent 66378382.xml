 RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go for a bike ride on the Nashua River Rail Trail. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.   This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.    I thought that we would bike for about two hours, and if people are in the mood, we could plan on going  out to dinner after our ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 6:00pm &lt;strong&gt;sharp&lt;/strong&gt;,  at the S. Depot Rd, Hollis NH   location. Please follow these directions.   Take Route 111 West into Hollis.   When in Hollis, take Route 111A East.   The trail is next to the Amerigas propane tank.   I will have a Meetup sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring your insect repellent and plenty of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is at no cost! I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
