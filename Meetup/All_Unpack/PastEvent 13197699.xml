So this saturday night they are having an open house, no cover, me &amp;amp; Jason as the DJ and reasonably priced drinks (Jason is much better than me).  If you guys have no plans please come on by....and if you do have plans come on by anyway. The doors open at 7 but realistically nothing will happen until after 8pm.  So I will start the event at 8 pm and you can come on down. I hope to see you there.... - R&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the DJ and will have a table for us</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271794036000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271389267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute Club night at Bay Pointe Country Club in Wareham</name><id>13197699</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271548800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/13197699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
