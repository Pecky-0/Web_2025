We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time. There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group). Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals. This is a dog free hiking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trailhead: Take I93 north to exit 35, take US3 north, make a right onto US302, at Zealand Campground make a right onto Zealand Road, parking lot for Zealand Trail at the end of the road. We will hike the Zealand Trail to the Zealand Hut (water and bathrooms) and the Twinway to Zeafcliff (3650'). Magnificent views from the outlook on Zeacliff.&amp;nbsp; 7.8 miles round trip, 1700' elevation gain, AMC booktime 5 hours, 8 hours estimated time for our group. (The faster part of the group can go on to the wooded summit of Zealand Mountain, 4260', extra 600' elevation gain, 3.2 miles, 1.5 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
