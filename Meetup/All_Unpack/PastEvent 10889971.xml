When Theseus returns, alive and well, Phèdre, fearing exposure, accuses her stepson of rape. The result is carnage. Academy Award winner Helen Mirren takes the title role in this savage play by Jean Racine, translated into muscular free verse by Ted Hughes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NT Live is a new initiative to broadcast performances of National Theatre plays onto cinema screens around the world.&lt;/b&gt; This production of Phèdre was performed in London on Thursday, June 25, 2009, and will be in presented from a stunning high definition recording on our giant main screen. Future NT Live performances coming this fall to the Coolidge will be presented live via satellite. Phèdre runs approximately &lt;u&gt;3 hours with no intermission.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Look at me – see a woman in frenzy.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cast includes&lt;br /&gt;Dominic Cooper&lt;br /&gt;Helen Mirren&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Tyzack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Nicholas Hytner&lt;br /&gt;Designer Bob Crowley&lt;br /&gt;Lighting Designer Paule Constable&lt;br /&gt;Music Adam Cork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to avoid a 'Sold Out' experience, tickets can be purchased at &lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/showtimes" target="_blank"&gt;Coolidge Showtimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film, we will go to a nearby eatery for desparately needed refreshment and 'decompression' discussion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the movies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will be sipping coffee using the Meetup Sign as a doily outside the Coolidge before the film, then holding a Meetup Sign in the lobby afterwards to lead the group to refreshment/discussion.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247758214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PHEDRE</name><id>10889971</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248620400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/10889971/</event_url></item>
