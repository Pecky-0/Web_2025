&lt;p&gt;Let's get together and explore the city of Salem for Halloween this Saturday! I have never really celebrated Halloween (wasn't allowed to go trick or treating as a kid), but figure this would be the ultimate experience. It would have to be only a day trip for me as I have a dress rehearsal in the morning and concert in the evening, but whoever wants to go early and stay late could find rides with others to and fro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can fit 4 people in my car; we can meet up near my rehearsal area at BU &amp;nbsp;around 1:15-1:30; those who would like to ride with me can email me for details on where exactly to meet. &amp;nbsp;We would have to be back in town by 6:30 PM at the latest. &amp;nbsp;If you have a car and would like to carpool, please post in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319913362000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319468631000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Day trip to Salem for Halloween</name><id>38498902</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319908500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/38498902/</event_url></item>
