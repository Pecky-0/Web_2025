This is a place for us to explore what we have in common and where we differ on topics that are important to us. This is not a seminar - there will be no presentation -  come with questions you'd like to explore. We'll creatively use the space:  smaller groups to focus on specific topics, pairing up, etc. Join us to learn more about yourself and other SoJusters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final topic in this series is: &lt;b&gt;Becoming Conscious of Our Privilege(s) on Monday, April 26th&lt;/b&gt; at Elephant &amp;amp; Castle* by the State Street T stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The questions we'll be exploring:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intro question: How do you identify?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st small group question: Name the ways in which you have privilege. How does that impacts your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd small group question: How can we use our privilege to create a more just society?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Possible privileges that will be discussed: straight, white, able-bodied, tall, male, Catholic/Christian, citizen, native English speaker, gender-conforming, cisgendered &amp;amp; upper-class)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So you know what to expect, here's what we have planned:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6pm Socializing - order dinner/drinks (30 min)&lt;br /&gt;6:30 Gather in large circle for introductions (20 min)&lt;br /&gt;6:50 Break into 1st small groups (30 min)&lt;br /&gt;7:20 Report back (10 min)&lt;br /&gt;7:30 Break into 2nd small groups (30 min)&lt;br /&gt;8pm Report Back (10 min)&lt;br /&gt;8:10 Closing (20 min)&lt;br /&gt;8:30 Socializing some more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Elephant &amp;amp; Castle is located at 161 Devonshire Street.
