Why not do some shopping in Downtown Crossing and finish off with a movie?  We'll then go to an area restaurant for a post-movie discussion.  Note that the actual start time is 4:55.  Hope you can make it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been talked about for ages, but as a reminder...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Juno: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juno MacGuff, the title character of Jason Reitman?s new film, is 16 and pregnant, but ?Juno? could not be further from the kind of hand-wringing, moralizing melodrama that such a condition might suggest. Juno, played by the poised, frighteningly talented Ellen Page, is too odd and too smart to be either a case study or the object of leering disapproval. She assesses her problem, and weighs her response to it, with disconcerting sang-froid. It?s not that Juno treats her pregnancy as a joke, but rather that in the sardonic spirit of the screenwriter, Diablo Cody, she can?t help finding humor in it. Tiny of frame and huge of belly, Juno utters wisecracks as if they were breathing exercises, referring to herself as ?the cautionary whale.? At first her sarcasm is bracing and also a bit jarring ? ?Hello, I?d like to procure a hasty abortion,? she says when she calls a women?s health clinic ? but as ?Juno? follows her from pregnancy test to delivery room (and hastily retreats from the prospect of abortion), it takes on surprising delicacy and emotional depth. The snappy one-liners are a brilliant distraction, Ms. Cody?s way of clearing your throat for the lump you?re likely to find there in the movie?s last scenes. ? A. O. Scott, The New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;That smart, hip, human comedy you've been waiting for all year? The one with dialogue like a sugar rush and performances like grace notes? It's called &amp;quot;Juno&amp;quot; and it just arrived in theaters.&amp;quot; - Ty Burr, Boston Globe&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the front of theater holding a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199986097000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Juno</name><id>7080827</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200260700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7080827/</event_url></item>
