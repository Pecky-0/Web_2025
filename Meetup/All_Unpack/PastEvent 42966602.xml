&lt;p&gt;I'd like to talk about Electromagnetic Pulsing Pads and see if anyone has used one and what it's effects have been.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading about them and then recently Dr. Oz did a 20 minute spread on this technology and it's miraculous effect on chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will bring my pain patches, inflammation patches and healing Carnosine patches if anyone wants to try them.&amp;nbsp; Just let me know ahead of time so I can come early and "patch" those interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also bring my laser if anyone has an interest in experiencing this technology as well. Again let me know in advance so I can schedule you for 6 minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring any XMAS goodies you might like to taste.&amp;nbsp; I'll probably bring something from my mother's bakery stash which is always amazing this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
