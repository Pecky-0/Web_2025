The road across the Dam is plowed. The trails on the state park side are packed. Yes there is water...Everett Lake...but I feel the pups will be fine as there is not a current by the beach or away from the immediate dam area. I will be bringing along a 30' leash in case of emergency and would recommend others do the same. This is a good idea for any hikes in the winter that are near water bodies. So come on down to Clough's for a fun get together.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park in the Everett Dam parking area.
