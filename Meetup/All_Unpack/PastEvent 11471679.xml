If you know &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sedaris" target="_blank"&gt;David Sedaris&lt;/a&gt;, you know he's hilarious! This play is adapted from an essay broadcast on NPR that launched Sedaris' career, based on his real-life experience getting a job as a Christmas elf at Macy's. It's a pretty dark (and really funny) commentary on Christmas commercialism. You can listen to the original NPR broadcast of &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/lists/sedaris/" target="_blank"&gt;SantaLand Diaries&lt;/a&gt;. (You need Windows Media Player to stream it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: limegreen"&gt;Meetup details&lt;/span&gt;: I'll get the best seats available. The ticket + those outrageous handling fees (PPAC, Amazon) = &lt;b&gt;$36&lt;/b&gt;. When you RSVP, please pay online. If I can't get tickets, I will refund your money. Don't wait -- there are still seats left, but I'm sure they will sell out. &lt;b&gt;The deadline to RSVP is 5 pm Oct. 16.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;If you miss the deadline, but still want to go, send me an email&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 8 pm, and we will meet in the lobby of the &lt;a href="http://www.gammtheatre.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Sandra Feinstein Gamm Theatre&lt;/a&gt; at 7:15 p.m. Look for a small red &amp;amp; white Meetup sign. There is limited parking on the left side of the theatre and on the streets around the back of the theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the show, we will head up the street to &lt;a href="http://www.dohertyseastave.com/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Doherty's East Avenue Irish Pub&lt;/a&gt; for food and drinks -- a fun local pub, 342 East Ave, Pawtucket. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info &lt;a href="http://www.gammtheatre.org/OurSeason/Season2520092010/TheSantaLandDiaries/tabid/275/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Play summary:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From award-winning humorist, playwright and National Public Radio contributor David Sedaris (&amp;quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;When You Are Engulfed in Flames&amp;quot;), a dose of unconventional holiday humor, adapted from the author's best-selling &amp;quot;Holidays on Ice&amp;quot;. A young man arrives in New York with dreams of being a writer for &amp;quot;One Life to Live&amp;quot; and instead lands a part-time job as a Macy's Christmas elf named Crumpet*. From humiliating interview to elf indoctrination to run-ins with miscast Santas, pushy parents and a host of oddball characters, the author's real-life experiences are merrily subversive and fall-on-your-knees funny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains mature language and themes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for small red &amp; white Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261875734000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253979922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SantaLand Diaries -- Gamm Theatre</name><id>11471679</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260663300000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/11471679/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/e/global_10899422.jpeg</photo_url></item>
