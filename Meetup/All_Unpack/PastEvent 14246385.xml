You can also email me if you would like to be RSVP'd***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sunday, the &lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boston City Girls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group will be having a Brunch at &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;Johnny D's&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Davis Sq (Somerville).  Today I checked on weather.com and on Sunday it should be in the high-70's with a 20% chance of precipitation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is their actual Menu:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.johnnyds.com/images/imgs_menus/Menu_Brunch-Sun.gif" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: orangered"&gt;**They do have a specials each week which are usually very tempting. Portions are GENEROUS!**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is &lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 women&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; due to the seating (five at each table which excludes us from gratuity but service is usually really good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have posted two simple questions as part of the RSVP. (Yes, this is my first time hosting a meetup.) I hope that at least ten are available on this day - if not we can reschedule for either the 15th or 29th. I will be arriving around 10:30am. At Johnny D's we can discuss any other places that we can go to next time but most importantly let's enjoy some live Jazz music, socialize and eat!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Near the small tables on right-hand side as you walk in.
