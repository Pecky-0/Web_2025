Stay to dance after. &lt;br /&gt;

The group who sponsored this event in February had a great turnout, and several singles who showed met someone special, and have been dating ever since!! (Congratulations!!) &lt;br /&gt;

$10. cover includes free food (their pizza is great!) and admission to club for the evening. Bring a friend of the opposite sex who is single and "looking" and pay just $8 each. &lt;br /&gt;

Profits will benefit Motivating Miles foundation, participate in 50/50 raffle and win $$$$ &lt;br /&gt;

This will be a fun event, if you are single and "looking" here is a great way to meet someone in a party atmosphere without any pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338167483000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335359989000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Singles Mix and Mingle at the Junkyard (formerly Sky Lounge) in Nashua</name><id>62054382</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338073200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/62054382/</event_url></item>
