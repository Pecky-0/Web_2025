Considering it? Come talk about how to do it!

Please bring along anything you have along these lines (even the co-workers if they are willing!) as a show-and-tell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never thought about riding your bike in winter? Take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.icebike.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.icebike.or...&lt;/a&gt; !
