Two or more happy climbers are friendly &amp;quot;competing&amp;quot;.  The audience will operate the twister wheel.  The wheel will tell you where you have to put your hands and feet.  You can either go for the color of the hold or the tape - both is fine.  The person who peels off the wall last wins our cordial congratulations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, there is of course plenty of opportunities for top roping and we'll probably head to the Village Manor later on for drinks and food.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that Meetup members climb with the Meetup at Rock Spot for $10.  &lt;br /&gt;If you want to top rope, you will either have to pass a belay test or take the class.  Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock Spot is easily accessible by public transportation. &lt;br /&gt;Please check out the following link for directions: &lt;a href="http://www.rockspotclimbing.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rockspotcl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, climbing, bouldering and playing twister are at your own risk.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climb away, &lt;br /&gt;Lilly&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Lilly at the front desk</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>8472361</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252453433000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251779346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Twister at Rock Spot</name><id>11254935</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251932400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/11254935/</event_url></item>
