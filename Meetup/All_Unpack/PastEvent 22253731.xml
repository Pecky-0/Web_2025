&lt;em&gt;Are you responsible for a budget, but not a finance whiz?&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;Join Socializing for Justice for a Skillshare on Budgets for Non-Financial Managers on August 1, 6:00 - 8:30 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues. We create social spaces that allow for the possibility of cross-issue connections and run a Skillshare Series, hosted by The NonProfit Center*, which increases our individual capacity for movement building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00-6:30 Socializing - 
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;bring your own dinner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;6:30-8:30 Training and Q &amp;amp; A
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Financial Vision and Budgets for Non-Financial Managers&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt; This is a hands on workshop designed to increase your financial vision and perspective. &amp;nbsp;If you are a non financial volunteer, staff, board member, consultant, parent or teacher and want to feel more comfortable looking at and discussing financial and budget matters, this is the course for you.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Socializing for Justice - www.sojust.org&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1750 members and almost 5 years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (95+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
