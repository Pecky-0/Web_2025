The practices are for dancers who have at least the basic knowledge of salsa and feel they have something to practice. We'll look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE! To help us run practices more efficiently and help you get the most out of them, please state a few ideas of what you'd like to work on in your RSVPs, or email one of the organizers to the left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The practice will be 1.5 hours! 3:30-5:00pm at the Dance Complex.  We'll also be going out to lunch afterward to hang out for a bit.  Anyone up for Ana's Taqueria at the MIT Student Center for a couple burritos?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Note!  Ana will be teaching a special 2 hour intensive Body Movement workshop prior to the practice.  This is a great opportunity to take the class and stay after for practicing what was learned during the workshop!  Visit www.MasacoteEntertainment.com for more info on the class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to join us for lunch, whether you attend the practice or not. See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your dance shoes, your smile, and some ideas of what you would like to work on! Music is always welcome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The studio is easily accessible off the red line in Central Square by T. Or, visit www.dancecomplex.org for directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1162416936000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158339388000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Salsa Meet-up Practice</name><id>5132721</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162153800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/5132721/</event_url></item>
