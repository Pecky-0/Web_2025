Expose the 9-11 Coverup.&lt;br /&gt;2. Abolish the Federal reserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Susan is asked to address other issues (such as abortion, environment, healthcare, etc) she will address them in brief terms (1 or two sentences) that are designed to redirect attention back to the above two issues whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone helping to collect signatures for Susan Allen's campaign will be encouraged to wear 9-11 gear, hand out 9-11 literature and offer DVDs to voters. (Please keep all DVDs and literature focused on the campaign's two main issues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free &amp;quot;Investigate 9-11&amp;quot; T shirt will be awarded to any/all petitioners who fill up a petition sheet for Susan's campaign. (That's 25 signatures.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;###&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP and we will send you instructions on when and where to meet.
