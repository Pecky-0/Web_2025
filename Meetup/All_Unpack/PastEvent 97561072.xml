&lt;p&gt;Although I've never been to a paint night, I've heard ladies rave about it and it sounds like fun. This event will be guided by master local artists and housing 29 of your newest friends (the event holds up to 30 people...and it fills up fast), these unique painting parties are designed to give you the right mix of a little bit of step-by-step art instruction, a splash of socializing, a dose of top 40 tunes, and a cup of a refreshing beverage that will ensure a memorable night. With the brush in one hand and the wine glass in the other, let your inner artist free and discover new ways of expressing yourself on the supplied canvas. These bars-turned-studios, which all serve tasty food and delicious beverages, guarantee a good time on this special creative night out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sue </member_name><member_id>2976623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361675905000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357167986000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paint and Cocktail night Part 2</name><id>97561072</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361656800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/97561072/</event_url></item>
