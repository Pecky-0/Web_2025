Come learn how to cope with the doldrums associated with inertia and procrastination- to take control of life once more and head confidently in the direction that we ourselves choose, freed from as much unnecessary baggage as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Martin will join us again to share insights gleaned from neurolinguistic programming (NLP)- which I have been finding beneficial, along with many others in our Meetups this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin will share with us a fantastic new&amp;nbsp;strategy called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;S.O.R.T.&lt;/strong&gt;, which&amp;nbsp;can be used to help&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;clean up the mental clutter&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that is a source of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Inertia&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free also to come share your SUCCESSES in tackling Inertia - as well as to raise any other particular clutter-related challenges for which you seek solutions. Feel welcomed to post comments here, as well, about topics you would&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to see addressed in our upcoming meetings, along with information about subject-matter experts you know of who could perhaps shed light for us on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-And perhaps come away with a Decluttering Buddy to help you steer into the weeks ahead with a cleared living space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new venue, Andala Coffee House,&amp;nbsp;is across Franklin Street from First Baptist Church at the intersection with River Street in the heart of Central Square, Cambridge ... here are photos, transit directions, and more information on Yelp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/andala-coffee-house-cambridge"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/biz/andala-coffee-house-cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Andala, we will meet downstairs (if you have any questions about location, just ask Leo) in a quieter atmosphere than we've enjoyed before, with no background music piped in around us - much better suited to NLP demonstrations, it seems. &lt;em&gt;We'll find out for sure&lt;/em&gt;- and I am excited to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please arrive by 6:30 pm&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to order refreshments, ALLOWING EXTRA TIME TO FIND PARKING, if needed, in or near Central Square. Parking in a lot is available ONLY&amp;nbsp;in City Lots 4, 5 , and 6 ("back of Central Sq.") off Norfolk Street &amp;amp; Bishop Allen Drive -- NOT in the private lot to the left of Harvest Co-op, i.e., off Essex Street, which is carefully monitored and ticketed ... meters in the city lots and on the streets around Central Square operate until 6 pm.&amp;nbsp;While no purchase minimum for refreshments is specified by our host venue, participants are encouraged to order something substantive to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;support the business in appreciation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Management's permission to meet in their space. Please also be advised that commercial eating establishments generally cannot permit on-site consumption of refreshments brought from elsewhere, due to liability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
