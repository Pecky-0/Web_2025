Hike part of the Appalachian trail. The 19 mile trail is always nice. It is a rewarding workout with great views if the weather is right. Casual hikers would enjoy the hike to Zeta pass and return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;North Carter isn't on the 4000 ft list and is in the trees, but there is a viewpoint just below the summit that is nice.  I found the ridge walk to Zeta pass to be very enjoyable with good views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the 19 mile trailhead parking lot , Hwy 16, and we will then  walk the road north to Camp Dodge in the morning about 1/4 mile, cut through Camp Dodge - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a road that's drivable by cars and will have to walk around a closed gate, then straight through the camp until you come to an old logging road which is very wide, walk down the old logging road. It's  only 1/4 mile from there to the Imp Trail, which crosses the logging road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here we take a right onto the Imp Trail to the North Carter trail, which eventually runs into the Carter-Moriah trail where we're forced to go either left or right.  If we want to see North Carter we will go left, 0.3 miles to the summit, then turn back re-trace your steps a bit on the Carter-Moriah trail, and follow that all the way up and over Middle Carter &lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/c/5/highres_1661413.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;and then South Carter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually we will get to Zeta Pass which sounds grandiose but is really just a trail junction.  From there we turn right onto the Carter Dome trail and follow that to the 19-Mile Brook trail and back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.8 miles, 3,500 feet gain, about 8 hrs depending on stops and trail conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carter range gets LOTS of snow on it. If we have warmer spring like conditions we still will need to pack snowshoes. Melting and refreezing ='s ice. I have also found this trail unbroken on a previous trip and also rotten crumbling trails where you will post hole to your knees.  Prepare for all conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;Disclaimer and things you must know before the hike. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><why>Let's add some winter photos to our album of the Carter range.</why><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201740472000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Hike series: South &amp; Middle Carter Mountain!</name><id>7230842</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205065800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/7230842/</event_url></item>
