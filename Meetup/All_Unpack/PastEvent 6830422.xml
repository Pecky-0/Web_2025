That's enough reason for us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Showcase Cinema is located near 3, 495 and the Lowell Connector posts the showtimes. The 7:55 looks to work for the largest number of people... but please try to meet by 7:30 or so to be sure of getting tickets and in order to meet everyone from the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Romanowski will be the on-site atheist organizer; spot him in his grey &amp;quot;Friendly neighborhood atheist&amp;quot; sweatshirt. He'll be meeting folks, answering his phone in case you get lost -- 978-987-6071 -- and, afterwards, coordinating plans for going out for a bite to eat, drink, or cup of coffee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've sent word to The Lowell Sun in case they want to see a group of good-natured, movie-going, family-loving atheists attending a film that has got a small portion of American Catholics all a-bother. So, smile widely and show your atheist pride.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198435816000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196438646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Golden Compass</name><id>6830422</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197074700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/6830422/</event_url></item>
