No reservations here in the bar area so every extra hand pulling tables together as they free up is appreciated. Please be sure to cover any bar tabs and food bills before leaving and don't forget to include tax and a tip. This is always a fun and well attended event, come out and dance, chat and meet some great people.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will gather along the back wall next to the entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218029252000</updated><rating><average>4.63999986649</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
