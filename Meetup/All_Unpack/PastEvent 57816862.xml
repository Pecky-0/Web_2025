&lt;p&gt;On Saturdays in May we will be holding outdoor volleyball QK doubles series. These are friendship tournament event meetups that are reverse coed doubles matches played in a King-Queen format, meaning that you will be playing with and against different people during pool play. Top players after pool play will compete in a playoff format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a friendship tournament format, meaning call your own faults, as there are no referees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers for these events will be Matt BenDaniel and Brian Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be using the ruleset listed in the first post on the following: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/messages/boards/thread/8548572?thread=8548572" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/messages/boards/thread/8548572?thread=8548572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will start at 10:30 AM and will likely last at least until mid afternoon (~3:30 PM). If you would like to play in this event you must commit to staying at least through the end of pool play. Remember to bring snacks/food and water/beverages, as this event will involve a significant amount of volleyball play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is intended for players with experience playing reverse coed doubles format. To sign up for one or more of these events, please send an email to Brian using the following link on meetup:Â &lt;a href="http://volleyball.meetup.com/122/message/?recipientId=4774008"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferably, each player in a signup pair should send an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this event we will aim to have player numbers in a multiple of four so that there are no sitouts for players. Preference is given to AA/A/BB players who sign up in male/female pairs, although some single signups will be allowed. Note that sending an email does not guarantee a spot to play; spots are only guaranteed if you are assigned a Yes RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336950472000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332711299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Outdoor (Grass) QK RevCoed Doubles Volleyball</name><id>57816862</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336833000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/57816862/</event_url></item>
