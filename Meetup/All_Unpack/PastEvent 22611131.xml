We'll have a brief introduction and then we'll do practices that calm the heart and mind, absorb Universal Qi from the universe and circulate it in the body. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Unfortunately, over the last few months, life has gotten in the way and and has prevented me from holding more frequent Meetups. If anyone has helpful suggestions or if you'd be interested in helping out as an Assistant Organizer, drop me a line or let's talk at the Meetup. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you haven't attended one of our Meetups yet, I'd love to meet you, and if you've practiced with us before, welcome back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 All the Best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dee &lt;br /&gt;
