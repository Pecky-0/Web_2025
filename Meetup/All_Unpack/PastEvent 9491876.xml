<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Allright - I hate to have to cancel meetups - but three people dropped out on the last day and of the remaining four three haven't logged on to the system in over a month (I haven't been checking) and never posted what they were bringing despite a couple emails asking them to. So I'm assuming they will be no shows as well. Hopefully Biagio got my email saying I am going to cancel. I'll schedule another meeting for next month and hope that goes better.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237760540000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><id>1354358</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231606880000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Meeting - Sicilian Food at Chris's place - CANCELLED!!!!!</name><id>9491876</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235343600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/events/9491876/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/c/global_6879276.jpeg</photo_url></item>
