Those interested in expanding their Arabic animal names vocabulary can come and learn them as we pass the exhibits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zoo is about 45 minutes from Metrowest and an hour and a half from Boston. Their website is here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southwickszoo.com/homePage.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.southwicks...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and admission fees are here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southwickszoo.com/rates-and-hours.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.southwicks...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested but can't make maybe we can arrange the event again for another date. We'll be there in any case so you are welcome to join in. If you RSVP yes I'll send a message with my cell phone number. Hope to see some of you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salam,&lt;br /&gt;Amr&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amr</member_name><member_id>9918217</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278173734000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Arabic Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonArabic</urlname><id>1143990</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Area Arabic Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278102424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Southwick's Zoo Interactive Animal Vocabulary Event</name><id>13985901</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278169200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonArabic/events/13985901/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/d/global_12044205.jpeg</photo_url></item>
