Special events at the Coolidge have a habit of selling out, especially when we don't already have tickets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://store.coolidge.org/WebSales/Pages/TicketSearchCriteria.aspx?epguid=615521cb-c61a-41c9-abd2-f75643670013&amp;amp;evtinfo=5213~3c2614bd-0781-48b8-a8a2-e21eaa37e962&amp;amp;" target="_blank"&gt;Tickets for Bolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to enjoy a fabulous breakfast and balletic discussion, we will meet at &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Zaftig's&lt;/span&gt; at 9:00 am and then go see the movie, rather than discussing it after so that folks can 'Bolt' to The Kendall Theater for 'A Film Unfinished'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the review on the Coolidge Corner website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dmitri Shostakovich's second ballet, Bolt, brings serious and popular music and dance all together including Komsomol routines, Red Army marches, circus acrobatics, and vaudeville antics. Its first and last performance at the Leningrad State Academy Theatre of Opera and Ballet was in 1931. Critics argued that, while the ballet's storyline was topical – addressing the threat of industrial sabotage and the promise of Soviet industrialization – the music and dance were extremely superficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world premiere of the ballet at the Bolshoi was in 2006, in honour of the 100th anniversary of Shostakovich’s birth. The choreography, sets, costumes and, above all, Shostakovich’s masterful score, have revitalized Bolt, making it a theatrical event capable of making even the most cynical viewer stand up and cheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“... Once again, Ratmansky shows an ability to deal with large-scale scenes involving the corps de ballet. He also proves to be a master of droll comedy”. - The Moscow Times Context&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conducted by Pavel Sorokin&lt;br /&gt;Choreography by Alexei Ratmansky&lt;br /&gt;Starring Anastasia Yatsenko and Andreï Merkuriev&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be outside the theater from 10:30 until 10:45, then I will go in and will save seats directly in the center.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284824414000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bolt at the Coolidge Corner Cinema</name><id>14813152</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286031600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/14813152/</event_url></item>
