Sure, it's only 5.5 miles long.  Sure, there is &lt;a href="http://www.brickleys.com/locations.html" target="_blank"&gt;great homemade ice cream&lt;/a&gt; along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every time we've tried this, we've had to cancel due to rain, snow and even the orders of the national guard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DON'T LET THEM WIN!  SIGN UP FOR THE GREATEST *BIKE RIDE* KNOWN TO MAN.&lt;br /&gt;SIGN UP FOR &lt;a href="http://www.southcountybikepath.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South County bike path&lt;/a&gt;  on Friday, August 7th at 6:15pm.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is not a race, but we don't go at a crawl.  Biking should be faster than walking.&lt;/b&gt;  We've had people in their 20s to their 50s.  You don't have to be an Olympic athlete to join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just as much about meeting some nice folks as it is about enjoying some fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;If it is raining OR I get fewer than 3 YES RSVPs by Thursday night â€“ I will reschedule for another day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us outside of Brickley's Homemade Ice Cream in Wakefield, RI.  &lt;b&gt;If you're good, we might even stop to sample their fine product after the ride.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us.  As usual, I will be sporting my signature red road bike.  &lt;b&gt;I don't have access to a phone or to the internet at work, so finding me before the event may prove difficult.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To RSVP, go to &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Bicycling/calendar/11011196/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red road bike.
