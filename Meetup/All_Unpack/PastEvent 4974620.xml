The rest of us tried, but found that there is more to training dogs to use agaility equipment than meets the eye!  Most dogs enjoyed going through the maze.  All of the Maltese present refused to go through the tunnel, even if treats were thrown into it!  Afterward, I was told that the tunnel needs to be shortened a lot at first to lure dogs through it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcomed Marion and Leon Semonian who came for the first time with their lovely little Sparky.  Marion, Leon, and their daughter are the distinguished publishers of the very successful Improper Bostonian.  We're hoping to see Sparky on the cover in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1152887661000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1150049395000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Maltese July Meetup</name><id>4974620</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1152464400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/4974620/</event_url></item>
