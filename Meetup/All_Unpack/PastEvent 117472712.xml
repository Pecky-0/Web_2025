&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence and the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: O'Rourke's Bar &amp;amp; Grill in historic Pawtuxet Village!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's Spring, and time for something a little different. Are you ready to travel!? Well, maybe just a little bit out of town, but not really &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; far. This is Rhode Island after all..... Â ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we're heading down to Pawtuxet Village on the Cranston/Warwick line. it's oh so far from Providence; maybe 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is O'Rourke's; an Irish-style pub with views onto Pawtuxet Cove and renovated a few years ago with a large oak bar befitting an establishment of this sort. They also have an outdoor patio and small outdoor bar as well! So if it's nice, we'll be able to take full advantage of the nice weather!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where's Pawtuxet Village? If you've never been, come down and check it out, and if you know it than you're already in the know.....the Village is a great little secret about 10 minutes south of Providence. After a drink or two we can head next door to Dear Hearts and eat ice cream on the bridge overlooking the cove........&lt;span&gt;So, let's check it out!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy and NYE 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a scarf of some kind and probably outside on the patio if it's nice!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
