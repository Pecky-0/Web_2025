Here is the description on 2nd Story's website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A tale set in Providence, told with great skill: A blind date, a hedge fund, a mother, a will.  A smart play with startling Je ne sais quoi.  Compelling!  Weâ€™re telling you: see Becky Shaw. Its dark sense of humor, its rapier wit.  The mark of a major league megawatt hit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ticket Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $27. Seating is General Admission.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each person is responsible for purchasing their own ticket.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For reservations, please call the 2nd Story Theater at 401-247-4200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Note that Friday nights at 2nd Story do sell out early.  Please do not wait to order your tickets! I strongly recommend that you order your tickets now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cafe is no longer open.  I received an e-mail stating that they are permanently closed for dinner.  We're going to try someplace new for dinner this time.  Tong-D, fine Thai cuisine, was recommended and is fairly close to the theater.  Here is their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tongdrestaurant.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tongdresta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that will be attending dinner, reservations will be made under &amp;quot;RI Theater Group&amp;quot; for 6:00 PM.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of dinner will be handled as follows:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinks will be consigned to a separate check from the meal.  Each person will add 30% to the price of their drink to cover the 8% RI Tax plus a 20% tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meal will be on one check.  A 20% tip will be added to the total and meal check will be divided evenly by the number of people attending the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send an e-mail including my cell phone number to all who RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. If you will not make it to the restaurant by 6:00 PM please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner is optional and is not included in the price of the ticket.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet-up Logistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fairly large parking lot located next to the theater between Market Street and Route 114 in Warren. A sign for Second Story Theater is on Route 114, although it's somewhat hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be in the lobby at 7:30 and will be holding a small MEET-UP sign. Seating is first-come;first-served, so please be prompt so we can all sit together. When you RSVP, I will provide my cell phone number in case you're running late or get lost.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside front entrance holding MEET-UP Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Correia</member_name><member_id>8033800</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296409070000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291517735000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Becky Shaw</name><id>15644288</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296261000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/15644288/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/global_6290483.jpeg</photo_url></item>
