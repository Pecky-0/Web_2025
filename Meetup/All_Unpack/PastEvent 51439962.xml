&lt;p&gt;by Glen Duncan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of British author Duncan's fine supernatural thriller, centuries-old lycanthrope Jake Marlowe learns he has become the last known werewolf on earth.&amp;nbsp; Soon Jake is on the run from not only WOCOP, an antioccult agency that wants to hunt him down for sport, but also vampires, who have discovered that a werewolf bite can desensitize them to the ravages of sun exposure.&amp;nbsp; After escaping horrible torments at the hands of both parties, Jake is shocked to discover that he may not be the last wolf standing, and that it's crucial he survive to propagate his species.&amp;nbsp; Duncan (author of "A Day and a Night and a Day") keeps the pages turning with hairbreadth escapes that have Jake globe-trotting for dear life from Europe to the U.S.&amp;nbsp; But the true allure of his tale is the poetic and evocative prose by which Jake relates his transformations, kills, and thoughts.&amp;nbsp;Savvy and exceptionally literate, this is one smart modern werewolf tale.&lt;/p&gt;
