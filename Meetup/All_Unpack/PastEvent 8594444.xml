We have members who are experts in different aspects of the industry, &amp;amp; many who are beginners  looking for help from the more experienced members. We have fun, great networking time, and projects to get involved in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our current  project is a Fashion Expo, &amp;quot;Let's Wake Up the World to the Boston Fashion Industry&amp;quot;, Sept. 18, at Lesley University, as a part of Boston Fashion Week, &amp;amp; as our Sept. Meetup. &lt;br /&gt;If you google this use 1815 Masschusetts Ave Cambridge ma not mass ave.  Using Mass ave returns a wrong location in cambridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need all types of fashion workers &amp;amp; entrepreneurs to join us.  We have many vendors who will have table/booths for showing and selling their fashion products &amp;amp; services. The booth/table area is in the Atrium of University Hall.   Panel discussions will be in the amphitheater and there will be workshops in the classrooms.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should attend if you are interested in fashion, modeling, photography etc.  The event will be fun as well as very educational.   You will learn a great deal about  the Boston Fashion Industry history, current conditions and how to navigate the maze to become successful here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attendees can come for the entire event or drop in when you want.  A schedule of the panel discussions and workshops and a list of vendors will be put up on the message board soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you all there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Fashion Industry Meetup organizers&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the atrium on the second floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Ranere</member_name><member_id>975035</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jamall Oluokun</member_name><member_id>6487580</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Prithi Pais</member_name><member_id>7208428</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224196771000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219360227000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Fashion Industry September Meetup</name><id>8594444</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221753600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/8594444/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/9/global_5522201.jpeg</photo_url></item>
