<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi gang, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a great Darwin Day party at Redline Feb 12, joining up with others of more or less naturalistic persuasions.  Next year it will be the old man's 200th birthday so we have a bicentennial bash to look forward to.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For March, we'll head back to Z Square and consider the status of mystical experience. As naturalists, we are of course skeptical about claims that mystical experience is a direct window onto the world. But how do we justify this skepticism?  Can we find any grounds that would convince the mystic that he should doubt his revelations? Is there any reason to seek out such experiences if they don't reveal reality directly? Philosopher Stephen Law considers mystical experience at &lt;a href="http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2008/02/mystical-experiences.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://stephenlaw.blo...&lt;/a&gt; .   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you March 10, 7 pm at Z Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;twc  at  naturalism.org &lt;br /&gt;617-480-8846 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month):  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the round table downstairs in the alcove.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205363086000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202864646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mystical experience: a reflection of reality?</name><id>7320339</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205190000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/7320339/</event_url></item>
