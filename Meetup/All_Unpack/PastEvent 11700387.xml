There is a large table for us which seat 15 for those who will be ordering food from the &amp;quot;special menu&amp;quot;. For those just wanting to drink beer...the Cambridge brewing Company will be set up in the front room serving Beer Flights for you to sample the different beers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The East Coast Grill is normally rather pricey so this is a great way to enjoy the fabulous food on &amp;quot;special menu&amp;quot; price with  $4.50 for a 16oz glass of  beer!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257379914000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256397518000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>East Coast Grill Teams up with Cambridge Brewery</name><id>11700387</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257206400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/11700387/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/global_11382286.jpeg</photo_url></item>
