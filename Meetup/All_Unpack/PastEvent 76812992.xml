&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS: "Winner of Cannes’ Un Certain Regard Special Jury Prize, Elena is a gripping, modern twist on the classic noir thriller. Sixty-ish spouses Vladimir and Elena uneasily share his palatial Moscow apartment—he’s a still-virile, wealthy businessman; she’s his dowdy former nurse who has clearly “married up.” Estranged from his own wild-child daughter, Vladimir openly despises his wife’s freeloading son and family. But when a sudden illness and an unexpected reunion threaten the dutiful housewife’s potential inheritance, she must hatch a desperate plan…. Masterfully crafted by award-winning Russian filmmaker Andrey Zvyagintsev (Golden Globe nominee The Return) and featuring evocative, Hitchcockian music by Philip Glass, Elena is a subtly stylish exploration of crime, punishment and human nature."&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>11815097</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346468094000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Russian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordrussianmeetup</urlname><id>723352</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Russian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344394799000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night (Movie is "Elena")</name><id>76812992</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346454000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordrussianmeetup/events/76812992/</event_url></item>
