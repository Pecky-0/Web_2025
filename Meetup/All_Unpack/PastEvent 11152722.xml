We're not sure about the overall quality of the beach/park in the selected location, but it seems it's OK for playing volley-ball (there may be extra nets already there so we may hold more people than usual, or not! if we decide to play 2-on-2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Players should hopefully fulfill this level: firm understanding of game strategy, with a varied grasp of skills (passing, setting, hitting; at least good in one), know the differences between the type of touches to do to the ball (and when to do them) and willing to do all the time the 3-touch dance (in order to achieve a spike at the end: pass, set, spike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Access by T: pick the Red Line until JFK U.Mass.&lt;br /&gt;By car: beware, it seems parking is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: bring bottles of water, or you will die by thirst while playing :D (especially the sunny days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andres G.
