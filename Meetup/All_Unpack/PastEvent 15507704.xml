This hike offers something new for both veteran forest hikers and newcomers as we sample a variety of forest terrain.  From flat roads by cranberry bogs to paths around ponds we'll turn off onto forest trails gouged out by motor bikes to see for ourselves the effect the bikers have on the forest.  We will also go by the only private campground in MSSF and see a number of the private cottages that dot the shores of the forest's larger ponds.  In the past, the dirt roads have shown the passing of other forest users including the tracks of turkey and deer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to dress for the weather though the trees will offer some protection from chilly winds and the hills will warm us up, too.  Remember it's still a good idea to bring water or even a snack.  Dogs are more than welcome but may need to be leashed if we walk along any paved roads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292287845000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290260776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December First Sunday Hike</name><id>15507704</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291570200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/15507704/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/6/7/global_19502407.jpeg</photo_url></item>
