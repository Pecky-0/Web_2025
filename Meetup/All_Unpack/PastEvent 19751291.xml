Really everything. Oftentimes people are grateful for the &amp;lsquo;good things in life&amp;rsquo; and have trouble feeling gratitude for the challenges or harder times. This seminar will enrich your understanding of how the attitude of gratitude profoundly changes your world and your experience of everything in it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare Watts is an ordained Priest and Master Teacher in the Order of Christ-Sophia.
