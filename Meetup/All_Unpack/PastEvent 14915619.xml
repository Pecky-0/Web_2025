Ladies &amp;amp; Gentlemen, the game is on!!!! This Friday night @ Kings in Back Bay watch the 2010 AFL Grand Final LIVE....again!!!! Be apart of history as this is only the 3rd time a GF has been replayed. Party starts at 10pm, game starts at 12:30am. We have pies, coopers and a heap of prizes. Bring your mates, bring everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone who turned up to the amazing GF party last Friday, it was nothing short of SENSATIONAL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably 150 Aussies drinking coopers and eating pies and having an absolute blast, our best GF Party yet for sure. Great venue, TV's everywhere, fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to keep you updated on plans for the Grand Final Replay. We are hoping to do it all over again, same place same time. We are just once waiting on Kings to gain permission  for the late license and we have been told that we should know by either Tuesday night or Wednesday at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your fingers crossed, say a prayer, whatever it takes to make this happen again as this was definitely one of THE best Aussie events I have been to in Boston (apart from when the Hawks won 2 years ago!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY TUNED!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Damo</member_name><member_id>4884584</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286059441000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285622175000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AFL Grand Final REPLAY Party LIVE!- ITS ON!!</name><id>14915619</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285984800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/14915619/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/1/3/global_12425907.jpeg</photo_url></item>
