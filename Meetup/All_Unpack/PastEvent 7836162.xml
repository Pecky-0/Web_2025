Sorry guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the change is last minute, but the Post Office Cafe in East Greenwich, RI accepted our reservation.  They have a very extensive buffet for $19.95.  I know this is a little more expensive than locations we have visited, however, I have really wanted to try their restaurant for a while...  Hopefully it will be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event fills up, please RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; with a comment requesting to be wait listed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you are aware, I have ammended the attendance policy for the group. It will be effective starting this month's event. Please be sure to view the &amp;quot;About Us&amp;quot; page or the Attendance Policy in the &amp;quot;Messages&amp;quot; section to make sure you understand it. Also, if you could update your profile to answer the question that you have read and agree to the policy. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has not attended previous events, please plan on bringing a dollar to help me defray the cost of posting on meetup. For everyone who has attended, I only ask that you contribute every other event. This would be such a big help to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you there! Yay brunch!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the one with red hair in my profile piccy.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213110534000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>The food is good and the people are friendly!</why><group><who>Friends who brunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Brunch-Bunch</urlname><id>964634</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch !</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209489991000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RI Brunch Bunch June Meetup- Post Office Cafe</name><id>7836162</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212937200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RI-Brunch-Bunch/events/7836162/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/7/f/global_4147919.jpeg</photo_url></item>
