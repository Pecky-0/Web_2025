The Elks is air conditioned and offers a great floor, great crowd, great atmosphere and great bar! &lt;br /&gt;We will be having a special lesson in the Shim-Sham with Larry Baker! Be sure to be there, it's such a fun dance! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Shim-Sham: &lt;br /&gt;The Original Lindy Hoppers at the Savoy had a considerable background in tap and jazz dance. They used to warm up for dancing by doing traditional jazz and tap steps. Eventually, their warm-up became standardized and a group of them (including Frankie Manning) could be found on the floor warming up as the band was tuning up.The warm up became so popular that even today you can see a Shim Sham at most Swing Dances. The moves that you learn in the Shim Sham will give your Swing Dancing a great vintage look. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The lesson will be starting on time so Larry can have a full hour to teach! &lt;br /&gt;6-6:30pm Beginner Friendly Group Swing Dance Lesson. &lt;br /&gt;6:30-7:30pm Beginner Group Lesson in Shim-Sham with Mr. Larry Baker! &lt;br /&gt;7:30pm Swing Dance with DJ Alan Hep2theJive playing a great mix of vintage swing music. &lt;br /&gt;Come With Or Without A Partner &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Rte 2, East or West, take Ex 31A. That will put you on Rte 12 South. Go through three sets of lights and the Elks is on your right (look for a white building). &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186524465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
