Ethics is defined as, "A set of principles of right conduct. b. A theory or a system of moral values. &amp;ldquo;In Wicca you often hear the word "ethics" with very little definition. What we are talking of here is the principles that govern the use of the Universal Power of Magick. The Wiccan Rede, "An it harm none, do what thou wilt" is the beginning of the just ethics of the Craft. Some other things to consider when discussing Craft ethics are the Three Fold Law, Revenge, and the attempt to force one&amp;rsquo;s will upon another against their will or without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class examines the basics as well as a foundation for utilizing a system that will be productive for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class begins at 6PM followed by Open Circle at 7:30PM&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>10028347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320674791000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310427984000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Magik &amp; Ethics</name><id>25391271</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320620400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/25391271/</event_url></item>
