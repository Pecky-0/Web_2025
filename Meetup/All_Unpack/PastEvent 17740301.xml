  &lt;strong&gt;Update: Since it's raining, Iron Horse will have a place
  for us inside their store. We will meet inside the store
  from&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;1-4pm. They need to close up at 4pm to clean up. See you
  soon! Sandra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;World Wide Knit in Public Day (WWKPD)&lt;/strong&gt; was started
in 2005 by Danielle Landes and takes place on the second Saturday
of June each year. It began as a way for knitters to come together
and enjoy each others company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knit in Public Day is unique, in that it's the largest knitter
run event in the world. Each local event is put together by a
volunteer or a group of volunteers. They each organize an event
because they want to, not because they have to. They bring their
own fresh ideas into planning where the event should be held, and
what people would like to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iron Horse&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;knitting store couldn't get it
together in time to make it an "official" event as you will not see
the event on their website or the WWKPD website. I've contacted the
owner and she will hold an informal event. Feel free to come early
as Natick has their Farmer's Market event on the center green. You
can also check out Iron Horse's shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron Horse said that they will provide chairs, however, I plan
on bringing my own chair just in case there's not enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
