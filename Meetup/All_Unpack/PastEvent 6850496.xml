This December 16th, American citizens will dump millions of dollars into the Ron Paul presidential campaign to protest the oppressive and unconstitutional inflation tax - which has enabled a flawed foreign policy, a costly war and the sacrificing of our liberties here at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us this December 16th 2007 for the largest one-day political donation event in history. Our goal is to bring together 100,000 people to donate $100 each, creating a one day donation total of $10,000,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP here, and sign up at &lt;a href="http://www.teaparty07.com." target="_blank"&gt;www.teaparty07.com&lt;/a&gt;.
