It was great to see so many new faces and wonderful returning members...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also wanted to thank everyone who came out to the Last Meet Up- It was wonderful to see all you joining in on the Wiki fun! Keep updating and keep reading it all the time! And a very special thank you to Casey for being the leader of the Wiki- King Wiki if you will...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The May Meet Up has a home! Jeff Baker has very graciously allowed us the use of his studio again. Thank you Jeff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This month theme is going to be &amp;quot;Swap Meet!&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has photo related gear that they do not use, do not want, or is just plain sick of having clutter up their space - should bring it to the next meet up. Folks can swap with one another - or maybe even just do like free cycle does! ( &lt;a href="http://www.freecycle.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.freecycle....&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is to get that stuff out into the world and be used by other photographers! Anything to encourage you to play with new photo items is encouraged. Bring your things and maybe leave with new fun things! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bags, lens, cameras, film, flashes, stands, lights, tripods, gadgets, cases, cards, readers, books, prints - if t's photo related bring it on down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has questions or comments, just let us know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Scott and I are always to try to greet everyone who comes to the meetups.
