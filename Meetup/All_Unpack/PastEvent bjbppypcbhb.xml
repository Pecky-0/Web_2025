January 19th (3pm to 6pm).&lt;/b&gt;* For other months, EZ Acupuncture will be offering healing sessions 1st Wednesday of each month from 3pm to 6 pm. Acupuncture sessions will last approximately 30 minutes and must be scheduled in advance by contacting Jeane at mimosa3005@gmail.com. Please let Jeane know what time you will be there. You must arrive no later than 5pm.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Community acupuncture is a return to traditional healing, where treatments were conducted in a group, rather than individual, setting. Group treatments foster a sense of community and support and are convenient for family members or friends to receive treatment together. This also makes acupuncture more affordable and accessible for our patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: $30  ($10 off for first time visits)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acupuncture is a safe, natural holistic therapy that utilizes your bodyâ€™s inherent ability to heal itself. This treatment relieves pain, reduces inflammation, enhances immunity and promotes healing. Additional benefits include relief from headaches, improved sleep, and a deep sense of relaxation. Community acupuncture is performed on zero gravity recliners or yoga mats for your comfort and convenience. Most treatments take about thirty minutes and require no disrobing. Please dress comfortably - loose clothing is good. (no tight jeans)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kirkhealth.com/images/quote_faq.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295472718000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285886533000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Acupuncture Healing Sessions</name><id>bjbppypcbhb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295467200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/15714959/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/1/global_18372625.jpeg</photo_url></item>
