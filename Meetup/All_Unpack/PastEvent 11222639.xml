Just a reminder, it's $6.00 Tuesday night at the theater! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that come to dinner get to help pick the movie for the evening. The first to arrive will grab a table at Tony Pilla's (which is next door to the theater) around 6:30 PM. During dinner we will review what movies are playing and have a start time between 7:30 and 8:00 PM. Whatever the majority can agree on is what we'll see.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP Marie will respond with her cell phone number so if you're running late and can't make dinner, you can find out what movie we've decided to see and when it starts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don't come without RSVPing.  Recently we ended up canceling dinner and eating in the theater instead because the movie we all wanted to see started to early to eat in the restaurant.  I need to know who to contact if plans change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Address for the Theater is: &lt;br /&gt;National Amusements Showcase Cinemas Woburn &lt;br /&gt;25 Middlesex Canal Parkway &lt;br /&gt;Woburn, MA. 01801&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Take Rt. 128/95 to Exit 35 toward Wilmington/Woburn.&lt;br /&gt;Go around the rotary and take the exit for Rt. 38 S/Main Street&lt;br /&gt;Go about 4/10 of a mile and turn right at the light onto Middlesex Canal Parkway.&lt;br /&gt;The Holiday Inn, Tony Pilla's, and the Showcase Cinema are all on the right side of the road.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send those that RSVP "Yes" or "Maybe" my cell phone number.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marie A</member_name><member_id>4623326</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252872513000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251440556000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Movie Night</name><id>11222639</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252449000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/11222639/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
