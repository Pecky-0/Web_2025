I am going to schedule meetups for all of them even if I cannot attend, to let people know about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don't know &amp;quot;Some Like It Hot&amp;quot; - starring Tony Curtis, who died last week, with Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe - the quick synopsis is &amp;quot;Struggling musicians witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and are now on the run from the Mob. Jerry and Joe cross-dress into an all female band. In addition to hiding, each has his own problems; One falls for another band member but can't tell her his gender, and the other has a rich suitor who will not take &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; for an answer.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen the movie more times than I can count and always notice something new.  Go, enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287411167000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286916339000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Some Like It Hot" - Cine Classics at Cinema City at the Palace</name><id>15087727</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287326700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/15087727/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
