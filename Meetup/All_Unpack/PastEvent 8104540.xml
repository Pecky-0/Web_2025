In each round, the moderator reads a passage of bad prose, and members of the panel try to finish it. Members of the audience try to guess which is the real ending. So funny, your laugh muscles will ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my dirty little secrets is that sometimes I rather enjoy the bad writing. This gets me thinking about what exactly makes prose bad. Is the cadence? Is it misused words? Is it thesaurusitis? How exactly does it go above and beyond the simple mistakes beginning writers are always told not to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge: Bring a &lt;b&gt;short&lt;/b&gt; sample of bad writing. It has to be published. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: What makes it so bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;Open Discussion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216081335000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212958982000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers July Meeting</name><id>8104540</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215892800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/8104540/</event_url></item>
