This event is in conjunction with the Hartford Heights Tall Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too hot in July for real hikes, so we’ll have a pleasant walk along the Windsor Locks Canal.  There is no loop to walk – we’ll walk out as far as we want and then come back on the same path.  This paved path was formerly the towpath for a canal that took boats around the Enfield rapids.  It’s a lovely walk with no hills involved!  Meet in the parking lot at 3:00 PM.  Lot is on Canal Road in Suffield, off from Route 159, just south of its intersection with Route 190.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner or pizza after if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/1099810/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;) is the leader on this one so please direct questions to her.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1154531329000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152545725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gloria's Walk Along the Windsor Locks Canal</name><id>5016636</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1154199600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5016636/</event_url></item>
