In the past we've held Willows nights on weeknights, but we know there are several members who can't make it then, we'll see how it goes on Friday night.  If you have never been to the Salem Willows, you are in for quite a treat.  It has all of the boardwalk foods you might want to eat, great scenery, a carousel, and greatest of all: skeeball!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at 6:30 outside of the casino (the first building you come to at the Willows) and then grab something to eat. Then, we can hit the arcade and the casino.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it at 6:30, don't worry. Just come later and you can join in the games.  (You can contact us that evening at 617-599-0440.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279582968000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278005348000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Go to the Willows!</name><id>13973112</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279319400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/13973112/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/a/4/global_4204260.jpeg</photo_url></item>
