The two mages met near the walls of the abbey of St. Avarthil and dueled all night long with black spells, laying the old monastery in ruins with their magic. In the morning the surviving friars found Evard dead in the wreckage, and buried him in the town’s graveyard. Vontarin was never seen again.&lt;br /&gt;Now, almost fifty years after his death, Evard’s final curse is about to descend on the town and everyone within it. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306451893000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306261189000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Encounters: Dark Legacy of Evard</name><id>19559061</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306364400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/19559061/</event_url></item>
