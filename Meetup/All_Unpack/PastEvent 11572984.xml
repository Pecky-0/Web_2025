You are also welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking will be a little tough for this Meetup, as it is October in Salem.  There will be no parking on Lemon St.  unless you are Salem resident with an October parking tag.   For parking you may park at the Salem Commuter Rail lot, the Church St. Parking lot, the Museum Place Parking Garage (all in a 10 minute walk), or you can park on or around Cross St., as long as you are past the orange signs--about a block down the street.  Parking is also available on Northey Street.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Members who have been a &amp;quot;no-show&amp;quot; in the last six months will not be permitted to RSVP for this event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255710713000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254939237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Games in October</name><id>11572984</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255131000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/11572984/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/9/global_11107753.jpeg</photo_url></item>
