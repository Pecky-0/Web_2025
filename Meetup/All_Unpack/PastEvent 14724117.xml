I will be performing my original songs at 7PM. There is no cover charge.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emerald Rose has specialty drinks including the Fruit Salad drink and every beer you can imagine.  They also have Irish dishes to American dishes including seafood.  Their reviews are great and the atmosphere hospitable.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play pop, rock and alternative originals and I write most of my songs. My music is about having a positive outlook on life. I try to write with the intent of helping people from all walks of life get past their fears and accomplish satisfaction in their lives. If I can reach people through my music, I believe I am helping my fans one by one.
