<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Over the next year we will be looking at different practices within the Native community.  Not every meetup, but a good number of them!  This month, Standing Bear will share his knowledge of moccasins with us as well as some wonderful flute playing.  Mocassins for hunting, for ceremonies, for winter, for summer, for weddings... so many kinds!  Learn how they are made.  He will have moccasins for sale and/or will take orders if you wish.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be ready for a good time, good food, and good conversation.  Bring enough to feed at least four people and we start at 6 PM!   See you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people who are not on the meetup list attend, so do not be discouraged by the numbers of RSVP's!  Just think, this will be our 101st meetup!!  Where does the time go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269301170000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266710910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paths to Light March Meetup</name><id>khcdnynfbbc</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269122400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/12659039/</event_url></item>
