<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>On our first day, we'll focus on getting to know each other, discussing the particulars of performing for children and elderly in medical and homeless care settings, and addressing logistical and technical issues concerning the group. It won't be all business though--we'll be doing a fair share of improv, so come energized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 03/01: Tomorrow's meetup has been *canceled* due to the expected inclement weather and because several group members expressed their preference to reschedule our first meeting to Sunday. I will email everyone as soon as a new date has been set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll see me in the lobby near the entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237150444000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234934130000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Beginning -- Let's do something great together!</name><id>9766068</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236555000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/9766068/</event_url></item>
