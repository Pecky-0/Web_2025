Here are some of the reasons people come: Two stages of diverse music, bonfire art. Woodland art. The annual rain (and rainbow!). Dancing and singing late into the night. Discovery through world class workshops. Fabulous food. Meeting happy people. Networking. Communicating. Energizing. As usual Flyby News will be contributing publicity for SolarFest, and in return receives networking opportunities. This year FN will share its space with &lt;a href="http://ne911truth.org" target="_blank"&gt;NorthEast 9/11 Truth&lt;/a&gt;. Nature is an incredible inspiration and teacher for balance and beauty.
