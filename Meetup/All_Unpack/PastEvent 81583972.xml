Tastes N' Toasts is an event that gives you the opportunity to try food at a variety of Blue Back Square's great restaurants while supporting a great local charity. For a $10 donation to the featured charity, you will receive a sticker badge identifying you as a Tastes n Toasts participant, and will be eligible for all the great discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charity we will be supporting is Covenant to Care for Children (Caryl, our organizer, is the Executive Director of CCC). Each week there is also a host restaurant, which this week will be Besito. Covenant to Care for Children will have a table set up in front of Besito, where you can make your donation to receive your badge and a listng of all the discounts available that night. Along with Besito, other restaurants include Flemings, Cheesecake Factory, Umi Shushi, Moes, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the option to come on your own and go where you want, or meet up with other Fabulous Foodies at &lt;strong&gt;5:30&lt;/strong&gt; in front of Besitos to join together and make your food plan adventure for the night. If you are new to the group, just ask someone at the CCC table who the Fabulous Foodie people are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event runs from 5 to 9 pm. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for the CCC table in front of Besitos</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer</member_name><member_id>3917688</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348100536000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347209056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tastes and Toasts for Covenant to Care for Children in Blue Back Square</name><id>81583972</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348088400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/81583972/</event_url></item>
