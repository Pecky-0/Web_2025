Yes, it's the remnants of a tropical storm. Unless the power is out at the theatre, we're still going!**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarity ensues when food poisoning strikes the crew and passengers of a 747 (including Leslie Nielsen), and it is up to a former fighter pilot, his old flame, and an uncouth doctor to land the plane safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally-speaking, these events are well-attended, so plan to be a few minutes early to buy tickets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet up at Richter's for a pre-movie drink (my regular stop before a movie) at 10:45p.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric is your contact for this event, and contact info is in the RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the tall, handsome fellow with glasses.
