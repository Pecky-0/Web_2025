I am looking forward to meeting all of our new members and seeing all of puggies... and people too.... &lt;br /&gt;           PLEASE RSVP, this lets us know how many people are coming. When you RSVP there is a comment box.  Please put down what snack or drink you will be sharing with all... human or puggy... This lets us know what we need to have on hand to make it a delicious and fun day.... oh.. Matt that cake last month was out of this world.. yummy... &lt;br /&gt;   The meeting is on Erie St.  It runs between South Main and Boyton.  IF you get lost you may call my cell phone 493-6005.. pug hugs to all...
