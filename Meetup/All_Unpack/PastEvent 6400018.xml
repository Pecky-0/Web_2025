The Green Briar is a fine Irish establishment that we have visited many times during the past several years, especially in the summer (they have a nice outdoor area out back). For more info and directions, see their web-site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.GreenBriarBoston.com" target="_blank"&gt;The Green Briar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from screening RWC 2007, The Green Briar screens NFL, basketball, baseball etc. etc. so there's something for every sports fan @ this pub. But on this day it's International Rugby that will be the focus - that's why they're opening the pub up early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RWC game starts @ 9am, and like all sports players we'll need to warm up beforehand - will confirm the exact opening time of the pub for those that want to come in for an early warm-up... :)&lt;br /&gt;Typically a rugby game runs 40 minutes each way/half, with approx. 10 minutes between the 2 halves of the game, so the game should be over by 11am.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191935063000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190341604000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rugby World Cup 2007 - Quarter Final Game 3</name><id>6400018</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191762000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/6400018/</event_url></item>
