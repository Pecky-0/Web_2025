<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Join Wakefield Artist Connie Festo Lafond for an afternoon of &lt;span&gt;watercolor painting&lt;/span&gt; with a twist! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Let's make paintings with straws &amp;amp; tooth brushes as well as our brushes. This class will be all about relaxing &amp;amp; having fun as the paint takes us to where it wants to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333333"&gt;“Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.” &lt;br /&gt;

 ― Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 No artistic experience necessary to create your own matted masterpiece. &lt;br /&gt;

 Fee for everything including wine is $39&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you hear a voice within you say, ‘You cannot paint,’ then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.” — Vincent van Gogh&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Connie Festo Lafond</member_name><member_id>18614111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369356140000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363699029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Watercolor Painting &amp; Wine w/ a creative twist!</name><id>109981642</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369348200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/109981642/</event_url></item>
