<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;As always I encourage you to attend &lt;a href="http://readercon.org/"&gt;Readercon&lt;/a&gt;, a science fiction convention that is devoted to the written word. It's at the Marriott in Burlington from July 14 to 17. For those of you who prefer public transportation, the 350 bus will get you to the hotel, and you should be able to get a lift back to Alewife. If you haven't been before, check out the Thursday evening sessions, which are free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the convention, there are so many interesting things to do, it's hard to make plans, but I expect we'll see each other off and on. There is, fortunately, a long dinner break on Saturday from 6-8 pm. So for our Meetup, I propose dinner at &lt;a href="http://www.laosichuan.com/en/menu.php?site=Billerica"&gt;Sichuan Gourmet&lt;/a&gt; in Billerica. If you'd like to join us, we will gather in the lobby of the hotel (where the comfy chairs are) and carpool to the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310927992000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852158000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>wtcdnypkbvb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310853600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/20829431/</event_url></item>
