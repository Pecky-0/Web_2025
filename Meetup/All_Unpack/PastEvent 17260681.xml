Plan on hiking about 4.5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children and good dogs are welcome. There are picnic tables at the East entrance parking lot, so you might come early and enjoy lunch in the forest before the hike. We will ask for donations to help pay for this meetup site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at 12:45 PM at East entrance parking lot just as you enter MSSF on Long Pond Road. If you are coming from Carver, be sure to look at the MSSF Forest map found in "Files". It takes about 20 minutes to drive from the Carver entrance to the Plymouth entrance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>East park entrance - Long Pond Road</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Vickstrom</member_name><member_id>11406046</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304361377000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302522428000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Sunday Hike - Friends Trail</name><id>17260681</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304269200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/17260681/</event_url></item>
