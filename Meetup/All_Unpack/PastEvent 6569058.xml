<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I hope everyone enjoyed a nice Thanksgiving Holiday, and didn't eat too much turkey &amp;amp; trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary topic for this meeting will be &amp;quot;Developing Trading Rules and Trading Plans.&amp;quot; Some may consider Trading Rules and Trading Plans to be one and the same thing. They are not, but while they are different, they are also very inter-related, and we will take an in-depth look at how, when, where, and why. &lt;br /&gt;Since this subject involves a great deal of information, I anticipate it will be the focused theme over our next several meetings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you currently have a set of Trading Rules (hopefully ones you actually use), it would be helpful if you could bring a written copy of them to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and to the right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198674888000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192662216000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum November Meetup</name><id>6569058</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198105200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/6569058/</event_url></item>
