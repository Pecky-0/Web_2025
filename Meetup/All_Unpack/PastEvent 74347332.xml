 &lt;br /&gt;

 Join us for our August monthly Community Meeting!  We now meet the 2nd Wednesday of the month @ the Braintree Community Youth Center. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will spend some time at tonight's Community Meeting discussing upcoming events and ways to help.  After our Community Meeting we will break out into Committee Meetings (primarily Outreach/Communications, Fundraising and Faith Relations).  Please join us to meet your Leadership Team, Committee Members and Neighbors at our monthly Community Meeting! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This is an exciting opportunity for those who want some hands-on experience with Habitat for Humanity, even if not actually lifting a hammer to physically build a home for a family. The Local Partnership Committee (LPC) participates in lots of behind the scenes activities and brings the community together. This is a great way to utilize your skills, meet neighbors, help spread the word about Habitat for Humanity work together to bring a local family into homeownership. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please join us as we learn more about Habitat for Humanity and each other. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;Please RSVP Yes only if you are at least 98% sure you will be attending.  If you are unable to attend but want to learn more and/or be added to the email list please email your contact information (name, email, town) to the email address listed below.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
