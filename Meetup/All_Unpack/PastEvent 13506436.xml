We have 5 maybes and several people on a waiting list so if you're still uncertain please consider giving your spot up to someone who is waiting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time riding this route so we may have to stop occasionally to get our bearings. I will drive the route and familiarize myself with it before our ride. We will ride together at a 12.5-13.5 mph pace and I expect to stop for 3 or 4 breaks. If you tend to ride faster than that please be prepared to either go slower and stay with the group or strike out on your own.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of our members, Tom, will be leading the slower paced version of a very scenic ride starting from Concord Center, heading west to out to Groton / Lost Lake, and then back.  We did this loop a few weeks ago, and it was beautiful.  The route is entirely on paved roads, many of them back roads with little traffic.  Some small areas will have steady traffic, but I have designed the route to minimize this as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=102779203779063114278.0004832cb5b3eef96282b&amp;amp;z=12" target="_blank"&gt;Here is a link to the route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be slower paced ride (12.5-13.5 MPH) with rolling hills, and a few climbs.  Expect the route to last approx 4 - 5.5 hours depending on how many pit-stops are taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/482869/Monument%20Sq%20Meet-Up%20Spot.jpg"&gt;Monument Square&lt;/a&gt; in Concord, MA.  Be there at 9:45am, where we can say hello as I hand out cue sheets and we will be on our way no later than 10:00am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each person should bring an extra tube that fits their bike, plenty of water, and it is a good idea to have some energy snacks to keep you going.  And please domnt' forget sunscreen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to JRA Cycles for sponsoring our group and making rides like this free of charge.  Be sure to head over to their shop to say thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>2015761</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274591306000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274101028000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lost Lake - 40 Miles (slower pace ride)</name><id>13506436</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274535900000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/13506436/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/5/global_14205189.jpeg</photo_url></item>
