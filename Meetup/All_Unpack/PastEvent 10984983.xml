But then, hold onto your hats oldies lovers, as they bring on Shirley Alston Reeves, original lead singer of the Shirelles (remember the songs: Soldier Boy, Will you still Love Me Tormorrow, Dedicated to the One I Love, Mama Said).  But the night is just getting started as they finish up with Jay Siegel and the Tokens (The Lion Sleeps Tonight) with special guest Jay Trainor of Jay and the Americans fame.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a fun night... Come join us.  Brink a chair/blanket and snacks if you with.  Some of us will try to get there by 5 to reserve a spot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the dark blue blanket with white stars on it.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252854703000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248882746000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doo-Wop Night at Meetinghouse Park, Hampstead, NH</name><id>10984983</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250373600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/10984983/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/a/global_9525242.jpeg</photo_url></item>
