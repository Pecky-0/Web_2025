&lt;p&gt;For those who have never been to this 4th of July celebration, please understand that it gets BUSY, especially as you get close to the start of the event (which is officially 7:30), so I have the start time scheduled for 5:00, and I may likely be there far earlier than that to get a good spot.  So please plan accordingly (both time to get there earlier, and time to drive around to find an empty spot).  I'll post in the comments when I plan on actually being there on the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a cooler, bring some food, bring some beverages, and, most importantly, bring a chair or blanket.  The festivities start at 7:30 and fireworks are planned for around 9:15.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will send out my number the day before for those that don't have it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nidal</member_name><member_id>8949503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341521529000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun Folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Games-Events</urlname><id>1435824</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Games &amp; Events Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340225795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fireworks at India Point Park</name><id>70019622</id><headcount>9</headcount><duration>18000000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341435600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RI-Games-Events/events/70019622/</event_url></item>
