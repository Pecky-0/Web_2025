One way we hope to do this is volunteering our time.  Join us to celebrate Earth Day 2009 at Broad Meadow Brook where we help spruce up trails and gardens, put on a fresh coat of paint, and dive into other spring cleaning projects. There are plenty of activities for all ages and abilities, like planting native wildflowers or more strenuous activities, such as clearing and hauling brush.  There will be three projects that we will be able to help with.  See details below.  If you would like to join in, please indicate what project you would like to be in when you RSVP for this meetup and we will do our best to accommodate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Work for Wildlife&lt;br /&gt;3rd Annual Statewide Volunteer Day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broad Meadow Brook, Worcester&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Butterfly and Fern Garden&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help us renew and prepare our Visitor Center Gardens for spring.
