<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;br /&gt;The next regular meeting will be on Monday July 12 at MIT in Room 4-231 as usual.  The speaker will be Patrick Raymond, executive director of the United Inventors Association.  The UIA is a non-profit that helps inventors and inventor groups across the country.  They are particularly strong in inventor education and in certifying honest, competent service providers.  Patrick, an inventor in his own right, will share his experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no meeting in August, this year or any year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The September 13 meeting, at MIT, will feature Gus Bigos of Evergreen IP as the speaker.  Gus spoke to us four years ago, shortly after Evergreen was launched.  Evergreen, which is certified by the UIA, has entered into an agreement with Clorox whereby they are actively looking for new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrive as early as 6:30 to network with others.  The meeting starts promptly at 7:00.  A map of MIT showing the meeting location is at &lt;a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?selection=4&amp;amp;Buildings=go" target="_blank"&gt;http://whereis.mit.ed...&lt;/a&gt;.
