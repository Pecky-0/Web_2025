Well, here's my first attempt to change that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, July 16th, I've rented out a studio at the Dance complex for the Salsa Meetup Group to get together and practice.  Everyone is welcome to come out and get some practicing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time is 1:30-2:30pm at the Dance Complex, Studio 5.  Bring your buddies or anyone you know you'd like to practice with.  We'll provide the radio and music (although you're always welcome to bring your own!).  And once there, you can decide to split off into small groups to practice spinning, styling, footwork, partnering, rueda, you name it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will just be a $2 cost to help pay for the studio.  Everyone is welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email Ana for more info or to sign up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;info@masacoteentertainment.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>27</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1154117292000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152226600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salsa Meetup Practice Session!</name><id>5011348</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1153071000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/5011348/</event_url></item>
