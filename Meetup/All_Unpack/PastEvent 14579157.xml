His dense, bebop-influenced neoexpressionist work emerged while minimalist, conceptual art was the fad; as a successful black artist, he was constantly confronted by racism and misconceptions. Much can be gleaned from insider interviews and archival footage, but it is Basquiat's own words and work that powerfully convey the mystique and allure of both the artist and the man.&amp;quot; (Written by Sundance Film Festival )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realartways.org/cinema.htm#basquiat-radiant-child" target="_blank"&gt;Details HERE.&lt;/a&gt;  I picked the September 9th showing because of this special added opportunity:  &amp;quot;After our September 9 screening of Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, join us for a conversation with Basquiat's longtime girlfriend and muse, Suzanne Mallouk. Known as &amp;quot;Widow Basquiat&amp;quot; after his death, Suzanne Mallouk lived with the artist for many years and appears in 'Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child'.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showtime is confirmed for 7:00pm per the Real Art Ways website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284134152000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283093689000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child" @ Real Art Ways</name><id>14579157</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284072300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/14579157/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
