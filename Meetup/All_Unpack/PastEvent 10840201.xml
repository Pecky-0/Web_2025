<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>UTV has released its first official trailer of the highly rated Ram Gopal Varma helmed horror thriller, Agyaat, starring Nitin Reddy, Priyanka Kothari and Ravi Kale.

Very roughly translated Agyatt means "without Knowledge".

The 1m 25s long trailer has most of the same footage as shown in the teaser trailer released in February.

A film unit is trapped in the Sigiriya jungles of Sri Lanka and something out there is killing them one by oneâ€¦

Going by the trailer, the film relies more on suspense, rather than horror, to thrill the audience.

It is still early days. RGV wrote in his blog: "There will be quite a lot of Special EFX work after that which will take as long as is required to get the intended effect."

The film is due in theaters on July 24, 2009.
