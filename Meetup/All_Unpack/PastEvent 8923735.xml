<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Gulu-Gulu has a regular Monday night game night that they are looking to beef up the attendance for, and we are more than happy to oblige by posting an event on our calendar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, come and bring your favorite word game with you (mention it in your RSVP so we don't wind up with 9 Scrabbles or 9 Boggles for 9 people). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gulu-Gulu is accessible to most of downtown Salem. Parking can usually be found on Washington St., in the Church St. lot, and in the lot between Lynde and Essex Streets (by the YMCA). Gulu-Gulu has a great food and beverage menu that can be found at www.gulu-gulu.com. I do request that when we hold Meetups in food or drink establishments that everyone in attendance order at least one item or beverage.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Carolyn.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226190791000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223490786000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Word Games at Gulu-Gulu</name><id>8923735</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225755000000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8923735/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/5/global_2882981.jpeg</photo_url></item>
