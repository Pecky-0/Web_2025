It's about a woman who is being stalked by a man after being set up on a blind date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a summary and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2001/nov/08/theatre.artsfeatures1" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; from 2001:&lt;br /&gt;A disturbing contemporary chiller about a woman whose life of accomplishment is quickly destroyed by a disturbed admirer, the play works powerfully at its most basic level, as a suspenseful tale about the unraveling of a strong woman’s sense of security in the urban jungle. TIME magazine’s #1 play of the year. “Rebecca Gilman is a playwright to hail. Boy Gets Girl is gripping, important, and the finest, most disturbing American play in years!” -TIME .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $16. Please buy your own ticket through URI's Box Office, 401-874-5843. **You should get your ticket early, as it may sell out.** This is general admission, so we will try to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play starts at 7:30. We'll meet for dinner before the play at 5:30 pm at &lt;a href="http://www.pinellimarrarestaurants.com/cucina_twist.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Cucina Twist&lt;/a&gt; nearby in South Kingstown. If you don't want to meet us for dinner, and just want to see the play, please email me so we can make sure we all sit together.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256247572000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252813613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boy Gets Girl - URI</name><id>11358468</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255815000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/11358468/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/global_6290483.jpeg</photo_url></item>
