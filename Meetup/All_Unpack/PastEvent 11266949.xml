Fair attractions include Roderick Russell-sword swallower, Bwana Jim and his exotic animals, fireworks, bands, Ed the Wizard, animals, rides, vendors, food and more. This year we added a Wii Tournament (bowling and Guitar Hero) and a food drive on Sunday both benefiting the South Windsor Food and Fuel Bank. The fair is the largest event of the year in South Windsor drawing over 20,000 and it entirely coordinated and staffed by volunteers.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Volunteers are provided a meal ticket for the Wapping Fair food booth, allowed to enjoy the fair the rest of the day after their shift and invited to our Appreciation Party at Hometown Buffet. Volunteers are needed all four days to assist with admission, Wii Tournament, food tent, grounds, souvenirs and more. Our Volunteer Chairman Erin Aldi will contact all our volunteers to confirm times slots and preferences&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are located behind LA Fitness</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Erin K.
