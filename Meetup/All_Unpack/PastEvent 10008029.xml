Here is a place to answer design critiques for your particular market, develop more efficient production pattern systems, and answer affordable production and sewing problems. Space is limited, so ONLY 10 CAN MEET AT ANY ONE TIME.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Willett and her fashion design proteges will share their expertise on the creative design, technical Stylometrics pattern system, and efficient and affordable production techniques. Shirley has built this experience over 60 years in the fashion industry, 3 corporations, and 3 apparel engineering design grants. She was given a Boston Fashion Week Ladder Award in 2007 by the Fashion Group International for her work in helping young designers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Email Shirley for graphic map of directions</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne Norman</member_name><member_id>8862626</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239105056000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237730358000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fashion Clothing Designers</name><id>10008029</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238853600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/10008029/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/a/global_7779386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
