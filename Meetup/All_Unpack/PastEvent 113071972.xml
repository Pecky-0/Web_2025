&lt;p&gt;No hills, a relatively short 18 miles, and no getting lost (as long as you stay on the trail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will try to keep a 12-15 mile pace when riding and we'll stop at a few places along the way.  18 miles is not a long distance for an experienced rider but proabaly too long for a beginner so use your judgement.  We try to stay as a group but will ask you to bike on your own or turn around if you cannot keep the 12-15 mph pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to bring:  Helmet (required), Tire Repair kit, Water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;afterwords we may stop at a local pub for some food and drink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's meet behind the Bank of America / Not Your Average Joe's parking lot which is near the corner of Mystic Ave and Mass Ave (RT 60 &amp;amp; 2A)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will email my phone number out to rsvp's Sun.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary</member_name><member_id>10329460</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366031974000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365300575000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Minute Man Trail Bike Ride (to get back into biking!)</name><id>113071972</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365962400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/113071972/</event_url></item>
