It is a popular summer event on its 14th season and has been named as &amp;quot;Best 100 Things in America&amp;quot; by Reader's Digest. Here is a description of the venue as described by the event organizer:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;....WaterFire's one hundred sparkling bonfires, the fragrance scent of aromatic wood smoke, the flickering light on the arch bridges, the silhouettes of the firetenders passing by the flames, the torch-lit vessels traveling down the river, and the enchanting music around the world engage all the senses and emotions of those who stroll the paths of Waterplace Park... &amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More detail information about WaterFire can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.waterfire.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.waterfire....&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It normally takes about 1 to 2 hours to complete the viewing. After WaterFire, the adventurous people can venture to the Sovernign Bank Plaza a block away for swing dancing. It is an open stage dance venue with a live band until late night.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transportation is your own responsibility, however if you need or want to carpool please email me directly at (changw1_2000@yahoo.com). We will do our best to help facilitate carpools as needed. Parking is available at the Providence Mall which is across the street from the event. Because of tight parking situation at the Mall and surrounding lots, you should arrive At LEAST 15 minutes earlier to allow ample time to find a parking space.  Some organizers are planning to get there early to visit Federal Hill in the late afternoon and have dinner in the area before the event.  Please indicate your interest when you sign up for the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the Cityside Exit at the Providence Place Mall (Next to Uno)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren</member_name><member_id>5756338</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tony / Pei</member_name><member_id>8262284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252110364000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249964801000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire 2009 with Swing Dancing</name><id>11083719</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250985600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/11083719/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/d/global_10145821.jpeg</photo_url></item>
