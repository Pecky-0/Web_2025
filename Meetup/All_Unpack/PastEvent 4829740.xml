The performance is in the Loeb Drama Center, located near Harvard Square at 64 Brattle Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.amrep.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amrep.org/...&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that each of us buy tickets separately. (It would be probably difficult to buy 5-6 tickets next to each other anyway.) Tickets can be bought online and picked up just before the show at the box office. (Prices are $37 or $64 for B and A seats respectively). We plan to meet for an aftershow discussion. Let's meet both before and after the show in the theater lobby!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540048000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1136853448000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit in the A.R.T</name><id>4829740</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1137630600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/4829740/</event_url></item>
