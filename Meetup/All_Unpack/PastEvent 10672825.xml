Please join us if you can.  -Phil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Boston Karaoke Meetup Members:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a couple of months since our last get together, so I am looking forward to seeing everyone again.  As a one time special, I am lowering the cost for this Meetup to only $5.00.  Please bring along some friends with you if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Meetup is perfect for both expert and novice Karaoke singers.  Many of our members attend Karaoke parties regularly, but we also have people who are first time singers.  The group is very supportive if you are new to Karaoke.  It's a great place to &amp;quot;give it a try&amp;quot; with very little risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue we've selected has the best song selection in all of Boston. They have an extensive song collection including rock, pop, rap, country, show tunes, soul, alternative bands, jazz, etc. Over 40,000 songs in all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The room's acoustics are good and they have state of the art equipment with multiple monitors throughout. Definitely a great place to perform or enjoy listening to others perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you all again in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Phil&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Phil or call my cell phone at 617-429-6571</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Philip L</member_name><member_id>1522860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256234125000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonkaraoke</urlname><id>212993</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245257769000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup - Rescheduled</name><id>10672825</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249167600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonkaraoke/events/10672825/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/4/global_7069268.jpeg</photo_url></item>
