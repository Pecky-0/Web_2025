Before his kite-flying days, young Franklin lived a humble Puritan life as a voracious reader, resourceful inventor, a printer's apprentice and with a sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us on a trip back to Colonial Boston to celebrate the life of Benjamin Franklin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets for this tour are $15 ($5 for Boston By Foot members).
