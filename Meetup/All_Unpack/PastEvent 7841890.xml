The shows, a week each, happen three times a year, May, July, and September. The shows are all located within a one mile stretch on both sides of Route 20. There are 21 Fields each approximately 3 to 5 acres.  It is by far the Classic Antique Event of the Year.  Besides hosting the largest Antique Show in New England, we are centrally located in Massachusetts.  Driving access to the area is made easy,  as we are close to Route 84 and the Massachusetts Turnpike.
