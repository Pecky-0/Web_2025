(Really, we'll stay as late as anybody wants to stay!) Come for an hour or two; come for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGENDA: This open studio will be to work on preparing your journals for the January meetup swap. Bring your journal in progress or come with supplies for working on it.  We can help with anyone who would like to make their own book (you just need to supply your own paper but there will be thread, sewing needles, and knowledge to share). If you don't want to participate in the JAM Journal but want to come to work on your own project or swap cards feel free to join us. Arrive and leave when you want. Work on your own projects at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that you keep your RSVP up to date so we know who's coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about the JAM Journals you can see the discussion thread here:&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/messages/boards/thread/10224371"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMENITIES: Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: $10 to help defray the Studio rental costs. (ArtStudio 360 renters attend free.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP: These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting list. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function. Please RSVP for your guests as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event. See the end of this message for an important update about RSVPs for Open Studios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO BRING: Your own materials and projects to work on (just as you do for the regular Meetup). But basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use. Even if you show up empty-handed, we can get you started on projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANCELLATIONS: In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot; So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen H</member_name><member_id>10331591</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295829758000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294694559000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Studio - JAM Journal Prep</name><id>15997794</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295287200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/15997794/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/b/global_19441659.jpeg</photo_url></item>
