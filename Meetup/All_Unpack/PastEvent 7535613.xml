Stacked high and tall, stack up past the great wall, hot dodgers, cold ball, bowls full of warm flandaber, flipstewer or old leather shoe on a skewer - no matter the cooker each bite will delight - so each will arrive ready to dine and to rhyme. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by Jennifer (much better than mine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Seussical dinner&lt;br /&gt;And what might that be?&lt;br /&gt;A dinner of favorites&lt;br /&gt;For you and for me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Imagine your pot roast&lt;br /&gt;With a new little twist&lt;br /&gt;Bright colors, fun names&lt;br /&gt;Just a few on the list.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or a who style cake&lt;br /&gt;Is what you might make&lt;br /&gt;With bingles and bangles&lt;br /&gt;Whatever it takes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It?s all up to you&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you dare&lt;br /&gt;Add some Seuss style magic&lt;br /&gt;For an incredible fare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All adult folk are welcome. This is a monthly event with a good mix of ages and personalities. Come join us!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how it works, you pick a recipe that seems to fit the theme for the month. You bring the ingredients (and something to drink if you like) to the host's home. We all crowd into the kitchen and cook together. Then we sit down and exclaim in delight about all the wonderful flavors as we chow down on the different dishes. No one worries about who is bringing what because it always works out great. If your recipe calls for special (not found in most kitchens) equipment you should ask the host if s/he has what you need or you should bring it. If your recipe takes more than an hour to prepare and cook then do as much as you can before arriving or cook it at home (though that isn't as much fun) and bring it ready to serve.  &lt;br /&gt;Some people have been bringing copies of their recipes printed out for everyone to share. I am collecting the recipes and will share them with everyone at some point. If you send me your recipe via email I will publish it on the group page.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>All the whos who say yes will not need to guess, the street will be known by address and phone.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208191124000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><why>This will be fun because food always brings folks together.
