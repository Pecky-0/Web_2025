Folks who have asked for this, we've heard you.  This is especially for you!  ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; ONLY if you know for sure you can join us. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're renting the space.

You may bring your anger and bitterness into every relationship and new experience. Your life may be so wrapped up in the wrong that you can't enjoy the present.  This definitely stutters the ease and grace of flow of joy and fulfillment into your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein Alhadi, personal/ business coach and BostonLOA member,&lt;/b&gt; will facilitate a discussion to take action and embrace forgiveness in our lives. Learn some simple yet powerful exercises that will help you let go of the past, enjoy the present and create an empowering future.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make the decision to heal, to embrace true forgiveness and more forward.  &lt;b&gt;Forgiveness is a gift you give to yourself. Your heart and soul thank you..&lt;i&gt;.in advance&lt;/i&gt;!   ;o) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yes…Come share what you’ve successfully done to have a forgiving and loving heart to open your heart’s doorway to attract more of what you want into your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you very much, Hussein, for your gift of time, knowledge and facilitation at this meetup!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Hussein Alhadi&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;husseincoach@yahoo.com &lt;br /&gt;617-304-6162 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein is a personal &amp;amp; business coach and an enthusiastic student and &amp;quot;practice-ioner&amp;quot; of Law Of Attraction.
