This time we will learn how to make &amp;quot;boo boo&amp;quot; bags to help with those little hurts that we and the children often incur!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, bring a dish that can feed at least four people, and be ready for great conversation, good food and a terrific time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Meetup/potluck is the kick-off for a series of sessions that Patricia will be hosting for a separate fee on plants and medicine.  You would be amazed how many plants you may consider &amp;quot;weeds&amp;quot; are actually very beneficial in helping with pulled muscles, coughs and other minor physical ailments!  None of this information, of course, is considered a substitute for seeking professional medical help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will let you know the schedule for Patricia's sessions right after this Meetup!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, more people than those here on this Meetup board attend, so do not be deceived by the numbers of RSVP's!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you soon!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295313576000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852129000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Making "boo boo" Bags!</name><id>khcdnypcbtb</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295132400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/15819293/</event_url></item>
