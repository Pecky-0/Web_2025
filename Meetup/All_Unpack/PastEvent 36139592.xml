This time around, we'll be at Porter Square Tavern, conveniently located just off the Red Line. We've reserved a section with high-top tables near the bar, which is ideally suited both for people who want to sit and dine with friends, or who want to put their beer down and mingle a bit. If you have any trouble finding us, call me at 617-935-4951.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318167621000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317758498000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Friday Mixer: Porter Square</name><id>36139592</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318028400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/36139592/</event_url></item>
