&lt;p&gt;The calendar says that Halloween is over but in this neighborhood it is not! Mysterious reservoirs, woods and hills greet us, along with beautiful fall foliage and scenic neighborhoods. Most of the walk is well light. However, about a small portion goes through a level dirt path through the woods. With a flashlight it is an easy portion to walk. Please bring a flashlight. I will have a few extra in case you forget. To celebrate completing an interesting walk, some of us might have ice cream at White Mountain Creamery. I find their ice cream is the best around! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will also start the walk in front of White Mountain Creamery, which is just past the end of the B branch of the Green Line. There is also plenty of parking on westbound Commonwealth Avenue just past the ice cream parlor. &lt;br /&gt;
