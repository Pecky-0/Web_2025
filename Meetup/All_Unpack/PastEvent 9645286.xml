Update your meetup preferences to accept emailings from the message group + announcements/events and keep informed. [/PSA]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to get the word out on a trip leaving in an hour out of Nashua, NH.  I have the details in the message board already, but we'll clear the squawk pipe and sent them again via this route:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer - Bill James &lt;br /&gt;Cell Phone - 603.557.6055 &lt;br /&gt;email - bill@imaginetworks.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi all - short notice, but there has *got* to be some people in this group who are still alive out there somewhere, so I wanted to make the offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snowboarding at Loon on Sunday, 1 Feb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am leaving out of Nashua, NH at approx 6am and I will have room for one or two people. Expected return to Nashua 6pm +-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be picking up two snowboarders up around exit 20 off of I93, so best way to get in on this trip is to meet me before I hit the highway, or get picked up along I93 as well. Have a Durango with a roof rack, so gear will be the only space issue inside. &lt;br /&gt;Planning on being back in Nashua while whatever football game is on is still in progress since the superbowl isn't really until next year as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If interested, please get in touch ASAP!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill_J</member_name><member_id>4839704</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234022792000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233482391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday at Loon Mountain</name><id>9645286</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233493200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/9645286/</event_url></item>
