If you want to play, you must be there by 8:30.  That's when they ask for $ and team names.  They won't accept more than 5 per team so if you show up after the game has started we might be full. The game is over around 11:15/11:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've RSVP'd as &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and can't make it PLEASE call or text me and let me know.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start thinking up those dirty team names!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie is the contact for this event 512-413-4119 (fyi, trivia is in the basement so reception is pretty lousy. Also you're not allowed to have your phone out during the quiz so after 9 we'll be unreachable.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188515202000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187785317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia Time!</name><id>6223954</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188342000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6223954/</event_url></item>
