If you happen to come after we already hit the walls, just try to find me.  Don't forget to check the ceiling - yes, you can climb the roof @ BRG!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just look out for curly hair that might or might not be hidden by a red or white bandana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym.  You can take a belay test when you get there.  If you are planning to flash the ceiling, you are required to pass a lead test.  If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at BRG.  Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class.  You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonrockgym.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonrock...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climb away,&lt;br /&gt;Lilly&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>curly hair might be hidden by a bandana, will be waiting till 7.15</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>8472361</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244505954000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243478276000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesday @ BRG for a change</name><id>10510384</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243983600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/10510384/</event_url></item>
