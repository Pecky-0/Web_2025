The Encounter is a board game that creates an opportunity for you to get answers to your deepest questions. You may start with an area of concern that may be causing you stress and with the help of Brenda, you will create a question to focus on. You will move around the board gathering information to bring clarity to your question. You will not only gather information, but are able to shift the energy of the blockage. The Game helps one to look at your life from where you are now, and use the information you have gathered to make new choices.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bring an open mind and be ready to share good food (bring enough for four people), good conversation and a terrific time.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254068957000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250377464000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Are You Ready for Your Encounter?</name><id>11120094</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253397600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/11120094/</event_url></item>
