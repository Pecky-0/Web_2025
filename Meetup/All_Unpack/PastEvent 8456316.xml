These processes are taught by Dr. Joe Vitale, another teacher featured in “The Secret”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The processes respectively relate to Ho’Oponopono and a Cleaning and Clearing Method. They help you identify, isolate, and eliminate counter-intentions that are currently attracting undesired results into your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You will learn these powerful 2 processes and discuss your experiences in smaller groups.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Below the surface (of your conscious thoughts), a complex and deep-seated collection of beliefs are exerting an extremely powerful magnetic force in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these subconscious thoughts are in harmony with what you consciously intend, you attract it...&amp;quot;  - Dr. Joe Vitale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Open Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; Bring your question &amp;amp;/or situation you would like help with.
