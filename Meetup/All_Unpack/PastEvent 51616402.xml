I have decided to make "North East Shibapalooza 2012". This will be the first one of many hopefully. We are expecting Shibas from NY, NJ, MD, NH, MA and hopefully more! We are hoping for a outdoor picnic/park pre meet up on May 5th (location TBD) and the official meet up on Sunday May 6th at Crate Escape in Belmont, MA from 11am-2pm. We have created a website the includes posts with information about the location and any updates we have to share. The website for the meet up is: &lt;a href="http://northeastshibameetup2012.wordpress.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://northeastshibameetup2012.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt; We hope to see lots of Shibas and Shiba owners/lovers there! Thanks!
