This allows for un interrupted travel via back roads to a destination or between waypoints on our tour. These rides often offer great photo opportunities and memorable people we meet on the way. Weather is expected to be in the upper 50's and partly cloudy. At the warmest time of day we will stop for lunch and some time to &amp;quot;park &amp;amp; polish&amp;quot; so bring your rags and cleaners along! We meet at 9am on rt 2 in concord, not at the rotary, but where rt 2 &amp;amp; 2a meet. If you want to ride there together, meet me at the Hess in newton at 8:00 for coffee and a backroads ride to Concord. Also do mention where you will meet me when you RSVP. I'm not planning any slab for this ride, so everybody should be able to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for big scooters</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320592966000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320093576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall carver</name><id>39406672</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320588000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/39406672/</event_url></item>
