Join us for the Walk For Hunger this year. Last year a group of us walked and some even walked all 20 miles. May is &lt;b&gt;Asian Heritage Month&lt;/b&gt;, so come out and help give back to those in need and help us meet our goal. Together we can make a difference! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be walking at a leisurely pace. And you can walk up to 5 miles or 10 miles or the entire 20 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot make it, please consider a small donation to our team pledge sheet.

Thanks for your support.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.projectbread.org/site/TR/Walk/General?team_id=62200&amp;amp;pg=team&amp;amp;fr_id=1130" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.projectbre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About The Walk for Hunger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 1969, The Walk for Hunger has been a tradition in Massachusetts. Today, the Walk has become the country's oldest continual pledge walk and the largest one-day fundraiser to alleviate local hunger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first Sunday in May each year, more than 40,000 Walkers and 2,000 Volunteers start off from the Boston Common to make a difference in the lives of our neighbors. In Massachusetts, more than 554,000 people do not have enough food to eat.  The Walk for Hunger raises millions of dollars for the 400 emergency food programs that support families in crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be outside between the outbound and inbound T station. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve </member_name><member_id>5132502</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272978924000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271989823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk for Hunger - Sunday May 2nd</name><id>13265449</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272805200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/13265449/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/global_14562182.jpeg</photo_url></item>
