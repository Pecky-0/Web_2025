This time we are taking the party to Vox Populi, a premier afterwork spot among the Boston nightlife scene. Better yet the  weather is looking to be 70 degrees plus with no chance of rain so come and join the group for a few cocktails as we kickoff the start to a wonderful holiday weekend and the official start of summer! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have not been to any or a few of our events whether an Afterwork Mixer, New Member meetup,  or even a nite on the town in the city with the group, I encourage all of you to come this Thursday and meet many of our wonderful members!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meeting Details: We will meet at the upstairs bar if open, if the upstairs is not open please look for us at the main bar first level.  Please look for me upon arriving my picture is on the left hand side of the website under the Assistant Organizer section. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND coming early as possible, this venue is guaranteed to fill up fast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my phone is 617-671-5310. Please make note prior to arriving. Look forward to seeing you all there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Transportation &lt;br /&gt;Green Line to Copley or Hynes &lt;br /&gt;Orange Line to Back Bay station. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie - Nightlife Organizer</member_name><member_id>2175480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180218895000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Night Life Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-nightlife</urlname><id>111392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Night Life Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179720892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Afterwork Mixer Memorial Day Weekend Kickoff Party this Thursday!!</name><id>5800584</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180045800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-nightlife/events/5800584/</event_url></item>
