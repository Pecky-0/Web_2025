The room where we sang in was quite spacious and the song selection was good.  There are multiple monitors available for lyrics and it was definitely a fun time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the Karaoke System reserved just for us with our very own KJ host for the entire two hours, so please try to come at 7PM to get maximum singing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing all of you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Phil&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing my name tag,but if you can't find me call me at 617-429-6571</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Philip L</member_name><member_id>1522860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237680279000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonkaraoke</urlname><id>212993</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233599052000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup - February 2009</name><id>9654709</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235260800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonkaraoke/events/9654709/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/4/global_7069268.jpeg</photo_url></item>
