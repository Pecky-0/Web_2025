You know you have had enough fruit cake and ugly reindeer sweaters.   As expected, I propose hiking.  Ragged Mt. is a trap rock peak on the New Britain/Berlin line.  We are going to do a 6.0 mile loop on the Preserve Trail.  This trail includes sections of the Metacomet and beautiful views.  Come out and enjoy this unusually warm post Christmas day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail trap rock and forest.  This time of year there is no shade without the leaves.  Make sure to bring water and snacks as we will be out there no more than 4 hours.  The trail conditions may be gooey, so make sure you are wearing waterproof boots on this expedition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always with me, NO DOGS-NO CHILDREN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are parking on West Lane in Berlin.  Its a small area so squish and be creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Berlin&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=%5B311-499%5D+West+Ln&amp;amp;zipcode=06037&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.6285&amp;amp;longitude=-72.80135&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Berlin Trail map&lt;a href="http://www.town.berlin.ct.us/filestorage/24/292/471/Town-hiking-trails%252520Model%252520(1).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.town.berli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
