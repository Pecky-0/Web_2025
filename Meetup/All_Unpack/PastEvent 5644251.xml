This walk will also be a training walk in preparation for the Hunger Walk. Those of us who want prepare for the Hunger walk will walk further east before heading back.  Just how far will we go? Perhaps as far as downtown, but we'll see how we feel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet outside of Skellig's at 10:30.  Park in the Embassy parking facility - enter off of Pine Street.  There are a number of good restaurants to choose from on Moody St, the group can decide then as you will all be walking there together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a ride?  Please ask for one in your rsvp, saying what area you are in.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176820567000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175874545000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charles River / Hunger walk training</name><id>5644251</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176647400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5644251/</event_url></item>
