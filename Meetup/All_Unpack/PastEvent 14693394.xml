The performances will be followed by a conversation with McElvain and his fellow faculty scholars, Bruce Duncan and John Paul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scenes from “The Life of Galileo” will be presented on Tuesday, Oct. 5, at 7 p.m. in Percival Auditorium. Tickets are $5 for the public and $3 for students, and available at the door.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286389458000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283916292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humanist Ed' Night: Scenes from “The Life of Galileo” @ Fitchburg State College</name><id>14693394</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286319600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/14693394/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/0/global_17943904.jpeg</photo_url></item>
