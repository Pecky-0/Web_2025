&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a small group of fast hikers to hike the entire Carter Moriah Range in a day. This includes six 4K peaks (Wildcat, Wildcat D, Carter Dome, South Carter, Middle Carter and Moriah) and a handful of other peaks we'll hit along the way - Mt. Hight, North Carter, Mt. Lethe. This isn't really a peak-bagging trip - if you need these peaks, there are much easier ways to get them! This hike is geared towards people who enjoy long, fast day hikes and are looking for a physical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 6:30 am at the Dunkin Donuts on Route 2 in Gorham, NH to plan our car spots (and a possible bail-out mid-way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On this&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;fast-paced&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;one-way trip we will&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hike about&amp;nbsp;20 miles&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;climb about 7,500 feet&lt;/strong&gt;. Book time is&amp;nbsp;14.5 hours - but our plan/goal is to hike faster than book time and finish in&amp;nbsp;12 hours. This trip is considered to be&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;ADVANCED/STRENUOUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain&lt;/strong&gt;. This hike is somewhat more difficult than the numbers suggest - it's almost as difficult as a Presi traverse, so be sure that you are appropriately prepared. Between the hiking and the car spots, this will be a LONG day - and you should be prepared to hike out in the dark if we run behind schedule. &amp;nbsp;You may want to stay over/camp the night before and/or the night after.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 possible routes we could take - One option is to start from the Glen Ellis Falls trailhead, up the Wildcat Ridge trail, over the Wildcats and down to Carter Notch (and Carter Hut), then the Carter Moriah Trail over the Carters, out to Moriah and down to our cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option is to do this hike in the reverse direction - starting at Moriah and finishing with the Wildcats. This is the same distance, but adds extra 1,000 feet of elevation. We're considering this route because we haven't ever traveled those trails in that direction and it would be a little something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are familiar with these trails, we expect all participants to bring a map, and be familiar with the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To sign up for this hike, you should be an experienced hiker who has recently completed trips of similar distance and elevation - faster than book time. Please answer all RSVP questions - if we haven't hiked with you before, you may also be contacted by meet up organizers to further elaborate on your preparation/experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
