We usually go at a 10 mph pace.  Maybe we'll push it and go for 11 or 12 this time - certainly nothing that will get you winded or tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically it's just a social event that happens to take place on bikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet up at the Lowes parking lot and start biking.  Can't find me?  Make sure to take my cell # with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;NOTE: Due to popular demand, many of us will be having lunch at Mr. Taco's Que Pasa Mexican restaurant at the end of the ride.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red car and a red bike - Try my cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269957942000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269208519000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BIKING Washington Secondary Path ~25 miles</name><id>12949226</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269784800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/12949226/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/2/global_13808946.jpeg</photo_url></item>
