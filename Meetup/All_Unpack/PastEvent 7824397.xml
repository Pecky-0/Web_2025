At 10:00 we'll head to Uno's in Harvard Square to have a drink and socialize.  Before attending our events, please review our About Us page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about/"&gt;http://fitness.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A map of where we play can be found here: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonfrisbee.com/images/cambcommonsat.jpg"&gt;http://www.bostonfris...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a light-colored shirt (for visibility's sake), water and a fist fulla awesome. We'll provide cones, frisbees, lanyards, glowsticks and fun new friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the equipment. If you wish to donate, consider bringing a couple bucks or donate online (link available at &amp;quot;About Us&amp;quot; page above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE RSVP.&lt;/b&gt;  We're anticipating lots of new players now that the weather is getting warm and it's extremely helpful for us to know how many players to expect.  For now, we'd prefer not to enforce any sort of &amp;quot;you can't play if you don't RSVP&amp;quot; rule--but such a thing may be on the horizon.  Our top two priorities are safety and fun, and neither is served well if 90 players show up when we expect 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more and make our lives complete by RSVPing 'yes,' go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/calendar/7824397/"&gt;http://fitness.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact the Organizers through the website!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and see you on the field!&lt;br /&gt;-Chris Beaman&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be on the softball diamond, throwing LED discs or warming up near the bench.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209686565000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Because you're a fun, exciting person, and we're a fun-loving, exhilarating community!</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209341748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Common Mud Frisbee</name><id>7824397</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209513600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7824397/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/7/global_1405527.jpeg</photo_url></item>
