The idea is you take a weekend (or in this case just a day) and make as many ATCs as you can, and trade, trade, trade. Once you get going you'll be amazed how much you create! I thought it would be even more fun to do it in person, with everybody creating in one place and trading live and in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have lots of ATC blanks and sleeves available, and we'll start with some quick reviews for background techniques like &amp;nbsp; using tissue/ napkins for backgrounds and for rubber stamped accents (a little preview of the March Meetups "Stamp-ede"!).&amp;nbsp; We'll also cover some finishing touches, like using embossing powders with or without rubber stamps,&amp;nbsp; adding embellishments, using glazes and 'drawing in' to help unify your collaged piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each collage-a-thoner will receive a packet of collage goodies; you are welcome to bring your favorite tools (preferred adhesives, scissors, pens, a few rubber stamps, inks, etc.) and a small assortment of special papers and embellishments. Got something you've been saving for something "special"? This is it! But please limit yourself to no more than a half-inch (or so) stack of ephemera.&amp;nbsp; Making art quickly often happens best when you are restricted to just a small amount of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW  TO SIGN UP: These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting  list.  Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function.  You may  RSVP for a guest as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests'  plans) change, PLEASE update your  RSVP accordingly. Please do this right  up to the start time of the  event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT TO BRING: All of the materials will be provided (included in  your cost for attending)&amp;nbsp; And basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS,   etc. -- are available for your use.&amp;nbsp; But if you have favorite basics, by all means  bring them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Even if you show up empty-handed,   we can get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CANCELLATIONS: In the  unlikely event that we need to cancel---or  even if we're just getting a  late start--we'll post a message on the  Web site and e-mail everyone  who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe  side, please check the Web site  and your inbox before departing for  ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading will be informal, just hold it up when it's done and say "Anyone want this one?" :)&amp;nbsp; At the end we'll display what we've made and (I hope) take some pictures of the ATCs...and conclude with a grand trading session!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>emelengy</member_name><member_id>4250560</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsi</member_name><member_id>5074581</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298825298000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><why>Inspired by virtual "a-thons" on the site AtcsForAll.com, we're going to spend a whole day (from 11am to 7pm) making collage ATCs using a few favorite tools and the materials provided.
