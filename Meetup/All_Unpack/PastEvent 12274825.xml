Check her out if you don't already know who she is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to reserve one table for 4 people at this concert at Club Passim - so we need to book fast as it's a small venue. Sitting at a table you get a better view but you have to buy food - which is nice and not expensive (Veggie Planet). They also serve beer and wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested, please let me know and sign up with payment immediately. I'm only taking RSVPS until Sunday at 5 pm as I don't want to miss this opportunity. This show will probably sell out and the venue doesn't lend itself to large numbers of people so I'm limiting numbers to me plus 3 people. For those wanting to sign up after this deadline you can go to the  Club Passim website and book yourself but we won't necessarily be able to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet for drink at Casablanca first at 7 pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265764458000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263096195000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karan Casey at Passim</name><id>12274825</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265590800000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/12274825/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/6/global_5526982.jpeg</photo_url></item>
