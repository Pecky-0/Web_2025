Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.  This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.   I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail.  So come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends.&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 2:00 pm in the parking lot off of the Audubon Center.   &lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Directions to Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;1. From I-93 and points west and north and south of Manchester, take Exit 7 to Route 101 East (Seacoast). Watch for the Audubon signs.&lt;br /&gt;2.

I hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295215806000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294792136000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Snowshoeing on the Audubon Society Massabesic Trails</name><id>16014976</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295204400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/16014976/</event_url></item>
