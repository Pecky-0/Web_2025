In the past, those who have walked it have been called monks or monastics and have lived secluded lives. Well, it is now a new age and a new millennia and the Order of Christ/Sophia has the way for individuals wanting a life of devotion and love for God, while being in the world, but not of it. Communities now exist in fifteen Centers of Light around the country where young and old as well as those raising families and single live the experience of a devoted and communal life. In this age of decadence, there is still a way back to innocence, and the Order of Christ/Sophia has found the way.
