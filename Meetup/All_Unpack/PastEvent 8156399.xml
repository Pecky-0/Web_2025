I can't wait for this weekend to play again. You are invited to join us. Whether you are good, bad or indifferent, our main goal is to have fun. We have a great group of regulars and have new people come every week and always look forward to fresh faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get to the Redline, its pretty easy to find us. Get off at the Alewife 'T' stop and head toward Rindge Ave. Cross over Alewife-Brook Pkwy and head to the fields. We'll be at the football field or the grass field right next to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214971997000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213671095000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FLAG FOOTBALL - SAT 4PM - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8156399</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214078400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8156399/</event_url></item>
