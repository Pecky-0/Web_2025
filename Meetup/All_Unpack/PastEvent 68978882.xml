Why settle for pen and paper trivia, where someone throws a sheet of paper in front of you and your respond to the questions asked. Then have to wait for your score. Why not have the questions asked via Video display, and respond by using a buzzer and keep track of your score as you go along. 4 fast paced rounds, thought provoking, challenging questions. We have a winner each round and a grand prize winner for the individual or team with the most overall points scored that night. So instead of being STUMPED by the others why not come to the Rosebud and get your BUZZ on. Lot's of great fun, unbelievable menu, and great drinks, mixed my M&amp;amp;M himself.... Looking to start a Trivia Tournament in a few weeks, we have a great prize a White Water River Rafting trip for 2. So come check us out on Wednesday Nights.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340249312000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339592975000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Interactive Game Show Style Trivia (Live)</name><id>68978882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340236800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/68978882/</event_url></item>
