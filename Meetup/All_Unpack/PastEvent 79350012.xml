Almost everyone knows the history of the French Impressionist art movement and the oft-repeated story of these artists freeing themselves from the strict rigidity of the French Academic art establishment. In the late 19th century French Impressionist artists were the avant-garde. Their paintings spawned a century of “modern art”. &lt;br /&gt;

 Fast forward 100 years and you find this same dynamic in reverse. Today’s bohemian artist is acting out against modernism and the prevailing academic dogma that devalues technical mastery. There are now a cadre of small artistic groups reviving the academic methods of the 19th C. Ecole des Beaux-Arts globally. In Boston these bohemians call themselves the Academy of Realist Art, Boston. Join other Euro Social and FCC members for the opening from 6:30 to 8:30 pm. Complimentary French wine will be served at the opening reception. A call to the FCC at 617-912-0400 to RSVP would ease your entry.&lt;/p&gt;
