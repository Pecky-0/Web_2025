&lt;p&gt;At the Guard Up After School Program your child begins the adventure each afternoon at our Burlington facility. Upon arrival to the facility, they will have a chance to unpack their things, settle in, and have a snack. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 After the snack, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take out their books and do their homework. All of our staff are willing and able to help your child with any difficult assignments, so feel free to let us know about their problem areas! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Once all of their homework is done (according to the Homework Contract they sign with you, the parent, before they attend our program) it&amp;rsquo;s time to begin the adventure! Kids gear up with their fellow adventurers and fight monsters, solve riddles, and uncover treasures in our magical and mystical realm!&lt;/p&gt;
