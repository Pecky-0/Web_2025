What a great way to spend a Friday night - get some exercise, improve your climbing, meet some new folks, and head out for food/beverages after. Newbies and old friends are equally welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at the picnic tables at 7 PM and we'll team up. If you arrive later, find me climbing and I'll hook you up with a partner. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and now for the usual stuff... &lt;br /&gt;Please note: you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt; for directions. You'll NEED them if this is your first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>4202767</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266192841000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265839860000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Climbing at MetroRock!!!</name><id>12573895</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266019200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/12573895/</event_url></item>
