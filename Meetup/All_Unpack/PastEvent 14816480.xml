Amazing dark wood paneling with incredible detail grace the entire bar area coupled with the old-world charm of herald painted stained glass windows. It is truly a feast for the eyes!  Plus the restaurant side is very trendy and known for their locally grown eclectic mix of gourmet fare and house-created drink concoctions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can it be true!!!??? We haven't been to Local 121 for an MNM in over a year!? Well its high time we go then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a blue messenger bag with me, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
