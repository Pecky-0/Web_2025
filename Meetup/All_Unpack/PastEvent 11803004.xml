Through quality and consistency and the personal attention of an informed staff, the Buttery strives to cultivate a pleasurable and welcoming experience, akin to enjoying a home cooked meal.  Our cuisine is driven by an eclectic combination of fresh ingredients and infusions that draw out the natural flavors of contemporary twists on classic American and English fare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mulling over whether to open the Buttery space in the Winter of 2005, we thought of naming the longtime neighborhood coffee shop something inviting and homey to reflect our concept for the new eatery.   Inspired by favorite haunts from our native New York and London, we decided to name our new bakery café after the type of communal dining place you might find in England that serves as a local mainstay for eat-in or take-away comfort food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because quality products speak for themselves, South End Buttery is committed to using organic, locally-grown and natural ingredients as much as possible.  We care about your health and use no trans fats in any of our cooking or baking. We searched for a specialty coffee roaster for months before choosing to feature the delicious blends of Equator Estate Coffees, a specialty roaster in San Rafael, California.  When we heard that the renowned French Laundry serves Equator’s fine coffees, we figured the blends must be awesome for Chef Thomas Keller to select them – and we were right.  Experience Equator’s fresh roasted coffees brewed to our exacting standards and prepared for you by our skilled baristas. We only grind espresso just before brewing and craft all of our espresso drinks by hand, using freshly pulled espresso shots poured within 10 seconds.  Likewise, our loose leaf teas are hand selected by the expert staff of Somerville-based MEM Teas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specialty coffee is the most labor-intensive crop in the world with thousands of indigenous people involved in picking and processing. Equator Estates supports projects and farms that promote quality and continuity of life for those who produce specialty coffee. South End Buttery is committed to serving sustainably grown coffee – coffee that is grown under a canopy of indigenous shade trees in a manner that preserves the natural habitat of the bean.  Our coffees come only from farms that practice bio-friendly, bio-diverse agriculture with an emphasis on organic crop management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, the Buttery also supports and has implemented environmentally-caring efforts in the workplace, such as using Dyson airblade hand dryers in all of our kitchens and bathrooms.  We also have eco-powered lavatory facilities and use recycled paper products and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As important as respecting and protecting the environment, one of South End Buttery’s principal core values is to treat everyone with respect, courtesy and dignity.  Customers, fellow staff and community members at large all deserve the same regard, kindness and attention. We even make sure your four-legged buddies are taken care of every day with fresh biscuits from Polka Dog Bakery right down the block from us!  Dog lovers (we have three), we also donate a portion of our cupcake sales to local animal rescue causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A knowledgeable customer is an enthusiastic one and that energy is contagious.  Isn’t it time for a fresh cup?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259691483000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257437822000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Brunch @ The South End Buttery - Winner!!!
