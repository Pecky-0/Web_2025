<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>*** Weather update 1/24/09: Temp for the hike will be about 26 F. Winds will be &lt;b&gt;moderatly high 18 mph with a wind chill that makes it feel like 12 F&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear plenty of layers, have head protection, ear protection, face protection (if possible), good gloves&lt;/b&gt;. With melting the past few days and overnight freezing it is anticipated there will be crusty snow and ice in traveled trails where snow is packed down. I don't think snowshoes are called for (except crampons built in will help with traction). &lt;b&gt;I advise microspikes, crampons, or instep crampons for traction in slick areas&lt;/b&gt;. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Tom State Reservation is a little Northwest of Springfield with 2,082 acres with 20 miles of hiking and walking trails; cross country skiing and ice skating on Lake Bray. Mt. Tom boasts an unparalleled view of the Connecticut Valley north and south, the Berkshire mountains to the west and the Pelham hills to the east. The exact length and path covered on this hike will depend on the weather conditions. If there is little or no snow ***we'll do a traditional hike.*** If there is something like 6 inches or more of snow we will either hike or try snowshoeing. We'll hike no more than approximatly 7.5 miles with less being the case if conditions require more effort given a 6 hour window for hiking. Most of the hike is estimated to be moderate in difficulty with some limited opportunity for high-moderate exertion. Streams, forest, and quiet solitude will dominate the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go need to have: &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food and water. &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed warm hiking boots or comfortable winter boots (no sneakers!) - There will likely be snow or it could be wet/muddy! &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks - To keep those feet warm even if wet. &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing - Avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too. &lt;br /&gt;* Gloves - MUST have &amp;amp; warm ones too! &lt;br /&gt;* Jacket - BRIGHT color best (white isn't too good)&lt;br /&gt;* Hat - You loose 20% of your heat through your head! Protect those ears too. &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water - MUST bring! &lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate food/lunch - (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;* Bright clothing -(I don't mean white!) for visability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advised equipment depending on conditions:&lt;br /&gt;* Gators or snow pants - Strongly suggested, as there could be snow on the trail and you want to keep it out of your boots! &lt;br /&gt;* MicroSpikes (or Crampons) - strongly suggested, to get through icy areas but not required.&lt;br /&gt;* Hiking poles (or snowshoe poles) - For better stability&lt;br /&gt;* Snowshoes - Advised if there is 10 inches or more of snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jacket shouldn't be too heavy as other layers of clothing should add to your insulation to keep warm and layers would be added or removed as needed. While hiking you WILL be hot but if you stop you WILL get very cold after about 15 minutes and thus need more dry layers added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 9 AM at the parking area at the main entrance by Lake Bray (see the park map). Directions are below. We will hike (with rest stops and sightseeing) about 6 hr. and get back to the vehicles at about 3 PM. Then the plan is to head out to eat an early dinner together at a location to be determined. We would finish up eating at about 4:30 PM and head home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S can provide carpooling for up to 6 from the Wal-Mart in E. Windsor ***leaving*** at a 8 AM for those interested. There will be a blue Dodge Grandcaravan Sport. Please chip in for gas and the drive is an hour. Return at about 5:30 PM. It is advised to call Kevin (number in RSVP) so he knows you plan to carpool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to meet at park parking area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Holyoke&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;address=50+Reservation+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/directions for the carpool meet-up can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;searchtab=home&amp;amp;formtype=address&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=69+Prospect+Hill+rd.&amp;amp;city=East+Windsor&amp;amp;state=CT" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General park information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/mtom.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/print/Mt.Tom.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this event is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
