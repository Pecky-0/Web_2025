Father Peter?s devotional and inspirational music springs from a heart dedicated to the Divine. His musical style, which infuses folk/rock with the essence of spirituality, is striking and powerful and clearly sets forth the ancient truths of the spiritual path. All donations will be dedicated to the Sophia Temple for World Peace, an interfaith temple for world peace. For more info: www.SophiaPeaceTemple.com.
