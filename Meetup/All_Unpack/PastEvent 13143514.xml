Taught by Sensei Craig, this is an anti-bullying and self-defense seminar featuring instruction, role-play, question and answer session as well as last-resort self-defense techniques. This event is for children ages 5 and up and only open to members of this group. Please RSVP to attend. We will need 10 children attending for the class to take place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced this class before. It is powerful and important information that they won't teach your child in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seminar is for children ages 5 and up. There is no cost to attend but you must RSVP the number of children attending through this MeetUp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, May 1 &lt;br /&gt;5pm-7pm&lt;br /&gt;80 School St&lt;br /&gt;Watertown, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://craigskempo.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://craigskempo.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maureen</member_name><member_id>11316246</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272921027000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Boston Parents</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Working-Parents-Group</urlname><id>1528072</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Boston Area Working Parents</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270920457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anti-Bullying and Self-Defense Seminar</name><id>13143514</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272747600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Working-Parents-Group/events/13143514/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/1/d/global_14249149.jpeg</photo_url></item>
