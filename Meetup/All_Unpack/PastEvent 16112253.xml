Through an ingenious use of camera and flashbacks, Kurosawa reveals the complexities of human nature as four people recount different versions of the story of a manâ€™s murder and the rape of his wife. Toshiro Mifune gives another commanding performance in the eloquent masterwork that revolutionized film language and introduced Japanese cinema to the world.                  - The Criterion Collection &lt;br /&gt;                                                             I couldn't pass up the chance to host a film at the Capitol in Arlington - very convenient for me. Hopefully the Capitol will continue this series for the rest of the coming year ... here's hoping. &lt;br /&gt;                                                          After the film we will go to a nearby restaurant. There is a good number of such within a few blocks of the theater. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCZ9TguVOIA" target="_blank"&gt;Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tim will be holding a film meetup sign in the front after the film </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>tim t.</member_name><member_id>4445447</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296534012000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295480364000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rashomon</name><id>16112253</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296338400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/16112253/</event_url></item>
