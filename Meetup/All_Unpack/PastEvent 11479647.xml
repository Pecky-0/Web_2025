Our first portfolio night last spring was a great opportunities for our new members to meet, and there has been a lot of interest in repeating the event. Join other fantastically creative Boston artists for a night of sharing graphic design, digital photography, interactive/web, video, animation, beverages, and tasty ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will not have a projector, so please bring prints or a laptop. We should have wi-fi access, if you want to show your online portfolio on my laptop. If you would like to share your work, please note this in your RSVP comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our group includes many incredibly talented artists and I look forward to seeing everyone's work!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256247867000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254079127000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portfolio Night II: Rescheduled</name><id>11479647</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255561200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/11479647/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
