&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is an absolute must-see film regarding the extraction of natural gas in North America and, increasingly, in the Northeast region of the US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is especially urgent for all of us to see this while the natural gas rhetoric is heating up in our own state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's possible that natural gas may be "cleaner" at the tailpipe, there is an entire product life cycle that leads up to the point of use that should inform our energy consumption and production decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, gas drilling has been sharply on the rise, and when Josh Fox, a theatrical director and&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;filmmaker, was offered $100,000 for the gas rights to family property on the Delaware River Basis in Pennsylvania, he was curious about the possible effects of drilling. Fox set out to talk to other property owners about what he could expect, and their answers startled him -- fracking taints water sources near drilling sites, and many households have discovered their water is not only undrinkable after gas drilling, it's even flammable. It turns out this is just the tip of the iceberg of the environmental damage done by reckless gas drilling, and in his documentary Gasland, Fox travels to 34 states and talks to dozens of property owners and environmental experts on the under-reported menace of fracking and the truth about the dangers of natural gas. Gasland was an official selection at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
