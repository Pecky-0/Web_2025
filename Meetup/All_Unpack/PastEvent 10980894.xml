We will meet in the small conference room on the other side of the building as we did last time.  I think the space is nicer and I don't have to set up the tables and chairs which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to discuss with the group the direction future meetings should take.  Would you be interested in monthly speakers, do you like the format of sharing our stories and journeys?  &lt;br /&gt;Come prepared to share with the group what you would prefer.  If you cannot come to the meeting and wish to e-mail your ideas please do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still actively looking for a new meeting room in the Reading area but it has to be very &lt;br /&gt;close by for me to actually use it.  I generally am finishing up with clients a half hour before our meetings.  Stoneham, Reading, Wakefield, or N. Reading would work probably. If anyone knows of a place let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks  BETSY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please understand I pay for the room and the meetup costs each month and I am not meeting those expenses through donations at this time. I don't want to charge for the meetings but I might have to do this soon.  The charge would be $3 if I do.  I know many of you are in dire straights financially so I will put off doing this another month or so.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255478394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248826221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia September Meetup</name><id>10980894</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252450800000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/10980894/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
