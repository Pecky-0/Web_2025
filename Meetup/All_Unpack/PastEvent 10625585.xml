<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Trivia is held at Chuck's Steakhouse in Auburn on Thursdays, from 7pm to 9pm. Teams are comprised of roughly 6 people. An emcee reads the questions, and each team bids a certain number of points per question. The team with the highest amount of points wins a prize, usually a gift certificate. I cannot reserve space ahead of time, but the game is held in the lounge area. We usually meet at an area within the lounge that looks like an elevated living room.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a sign; plus I'll give out cell # closer to event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorena Nozzolillo</member_name><member_id>4168426</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246143827000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244681526000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia at Chuck's</name><id>10625585</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245970800000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/10625585/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/4/global_7250436.jpeg</photo_url></item>
