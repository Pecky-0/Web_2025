Directions/address below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address is 119 Old Turnpike Road 3G, Concord 03301. It's an industrial park and a bit difficult to find, but not busy on a Saturday. The brewery is across from South End Auto. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Open House will be from 4 pm to 7 pm or perhaps a bit later. We expect to have the Combat Ale and also the Imperial Blonde available, possibly a pizza or two. Keeping our phone number available (603 617 2409) sometimes helps stranded travelers! We're very convenient to the Manchester Road exit off 93.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letâ€™s show our support for this new start-up business owned and managed by FSP early movers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Todd Puterbaugh</member_name><member_id>4083337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228352752000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227483575000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Introducing Free State Ale to Discerning Beer Drinkers</name><id>9218973</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227992400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9218973/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
