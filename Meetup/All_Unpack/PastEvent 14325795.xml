<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Hi all, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard this band is a blow-out awesome rock band playing all kinds of stuff! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band is called &amp;quot;Over 6&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only a $6 cover charge (at the door). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner is offering us all free appetizers too! (All he asks is that we each eat or drink $10 worth and we'll all get the round of free appetizers.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Middle Eastern Food and actually really good and authentic. So he said like free chicken fingers, taboli, fries, etc., so I think that's a good deal for us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band does not actually start till 9:00 so we meet there at 8:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple other Meet Up groups coming. There will be more than just this group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring along friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gregory DerBogosian</member_name><member_id>12639635</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281222943000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280982598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner + New England's Largest Cover Band!!</name><id>14325795</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281139200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/14325795/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/7/global_16963159.jpeg</photo_url></item>
