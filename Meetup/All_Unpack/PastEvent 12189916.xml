Avatar has been hailed as the next major advance in film-making. &lt;br /&gt;We are going to the afternoon showing of the 3D version. Check out the review at &lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091211/REVIEWS/912119998" target="_blank"&gt;www.rogerebert.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at Cinemark in Hadley at 4:40pm (the time/date feature for the Meetup listing goes by 15 minute increments but the film actually starts at 4:40) by meeting at Arizona Pizza in the &lt;br /&gt;all. Please wear something red to help us recognize each other. It will be nice to find each other ahead of time so that we can introduce each other and sit together. But if you're late meet us afterwards at dinner as long as you've seen the movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are associated with the &lt;a href="http://www.MovieTalk.org" target="_blank"&gt;Noho Film Group&lt;/a&gt; From that site you can sign-up for the listserv and email their entire group. It's a great place to discuss film with devotees from Northampton and beyond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.meetup.com/766/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please wear something red</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jonathon Podolsky</member_name><member_id>9289550</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263245771000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>filmgroup</urlname><id>1279822</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Western MA Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262363485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Avatar then Meet after at Arizona Pizza</name><id>12189916</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263072600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/filmgroup/events/12189916/</event_url></item>
