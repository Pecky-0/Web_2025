In this first Sunday morning topical meeting, attendees are invited to share their techniques, experiences, and advice for keeping it calm and cool when explaining your beliefs to others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also discuss the frequency of this meeting in the future, pick a tentative date for the next one, and take suggestions for topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reporter attended our last Wednesday evening meeting, and we expect a photographer, Joanne Ciccarello, to attend this Sunday meeting to obtain illustrations to accompany the story in the Christian Science Monitor (a non-denominational and international newspaper on current events, online daily and in print weekly). In your reply, please let us know if you are willing to have your &amp;quot;graven image&amp;quot; and/or name included with the story. And if you attend the meeting, please let the photographer know if you prefer not to have your picture or name published.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have pulled together some tables and chairs.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul S</member_name><member_id>4811434</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie </member_name><member_id>7248057</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246493133000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244739279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday morning topical meeting:Techniques for Rational Discussion of Atheism </name><id>10630211</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244989800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/10630211/</event_url></item>
