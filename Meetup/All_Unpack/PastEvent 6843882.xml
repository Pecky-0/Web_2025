We are most often at a downstairs table, but you can occasionally find us on the patio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should come? &lt;br /&gt;Rational sojourners! Anyone with an interest in Ayn Rand who would like to meet fellow admirers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should people come?&lt;br /&gt;To meet &amp;amp; drink beverages &amp;amp; socialize &amp;amp; ponder A is A and man qua man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's a good ice-breaker question members can ask each other?&lt;br /&gt;What is your favorite film embodying one or more of Rand's virtues? (Example: Saturday Night Fever is about a young man coming of age who realizes that life is not all parties and discos, and that he ought to make more of his life. Virtues: mostly productiveness, some integrity and independence.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should members bring anything?&lt;br /&gt;Yourselves! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will members find you when they get there?&lt;br /&gt;I'll have dollar-sign bling bling. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196637065000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand January Meetup</name><id>6843882</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199656800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/6843882/</event_url></item>
