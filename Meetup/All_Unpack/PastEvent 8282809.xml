This will be a very special evening, as it is the last week that our usual trivia master, Tucker, will be running the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come meet the other members of the group, meet new people and have fun answering questions about anything and everything.  Even if you think you're no good at trivia, you'll probably know something the rest of us don't, join us!  Last weeks crowd was large enough that the we had 2 teams competing and earned first and second place finishes.  The competition is getting better, we need your trivia skills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trivia game starts at 9PM.  I'll be there around 8:30 to find a table big enough for everyone who has RSVP'd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've been racking up a small pile of gift certificates with recent first, second and third place finishes, we aren't allowed to use the certificates on Monday nights during trivia, so we'll have a dinner sometime soon to spend those winnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sad news, this event will be the next to last with our favorite (okay, my favorite) trivia announcer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the guy with bicycle gear and a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216255205000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Great conversation, fun people, a fun game, good music</why><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215292154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Trivia @ Fatty McGees</name><id>8282809</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216081800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/8282809/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
