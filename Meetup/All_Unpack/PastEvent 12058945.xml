I've been watching the weather but more specifically the wind speed forecast for Sunday. Right now it looks like it could go either way. Since this is the case we will do the following-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should meet at the WHITEHOUSE trailhead as originally posted no later than 7:45 am. I will have an updated weather forecast as well as the updated wind speed forecast. We will discuss these forecasts and go from there. Either way we hike and have a great day out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you have the correct gear for extended above timberline travel. Snowshoes are also highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all on Sunday @ the WHITEHOUSE trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Milton</member_name><member_id>4294409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1263905418000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260460761000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Liberty &amp; Flume</name><id>12058945</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263732300000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12058945/</event_url></item>
