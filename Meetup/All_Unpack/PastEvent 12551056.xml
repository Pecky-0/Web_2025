I recommend you to go directly to this link to get the feel of the movie and trailor. This is an inspiring story that has been used by many to inspired others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freedomwri..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.freedomwri...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilary Swank stars in this gripping story of inner city kids raised on drive-by shootings and hard-core attitude - and the teacher who gives them the one thing they need most: a voice of there own. Dropped into the free-fire zone of a school torn by violence and racial tension, teacher Erin Gruwell battles an uncaring system in a fight to make the classroom matter in her students lives. Now, telling their own stories, and hearing the stories of others, a group of supposedly &amp;quot;unteachable&amp;quot; teens will discover the power of tolerence, reclaim their shattered lives, and change their world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you, &lt;br /&gt;Rev.
