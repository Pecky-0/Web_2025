Snowshoeing is different than hiking and it's a lot of fun. At this time of year, with the foliage mostly gone, and no bugs to contend with, being outside is truly pleasant. People just need to dress for the conditions. Wearing layers, wearing clothes that wick water away from the body, having gloves, a hat, warm socks, and good footwear make being outdoors comfortable. And don't forget to bring fluids and something to snack on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.beaverbrook.org/" target="_blank"&gt;beaverbrook.org&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Download and print maps here: &lt;a href="http://www2.beaverbrook.org/bbtrails.htm" target="_blank"&gt;maps and trail info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather should be nice on Sunday. Plan on a 2-hour hike (or more if people are up for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, send mail to Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me and Tessie (the friendly black lab).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff</member_name><member_id>2268166</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199808575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>The snow is beautiful, but may not last long!</why><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199560616000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Short Notice: Sunday Snowshoe</name><id>7038950</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199635200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/7038950/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/9/global_2914153.jpeg</photo_url></item>
