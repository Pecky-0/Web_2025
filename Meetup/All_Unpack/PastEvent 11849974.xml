Susan is 5' 2&amp;quot; and has a lot of blonde curly hair. She may or may not be wearing a red meetup hat. If the movie is upstairs, she'll be waiting by the tables by the big window. If the movie is downstairs, she'll be waiting behind the rope across from the refreshment stand. She'll be at the theater at 6:50, and we should go get seats at 7:05.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walt Disney Animation Studios presents the musical &amp;quot;The Princess and the Frog,&amp;quot; an animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans. From the creators of &amp;quot;The Little Mermaid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Aladdin&amp;quot; comes a modern twist on a classic tale, featuring a beautiful girl named Tiana (Anika Noni Rose), a frog prince who desperately wants to be human again, and a fateful kiss that leads them both on a hilarious adventure through the mystical bayous of Louisiana. &amp;quot;The Princess and the Frog&amp;quot; marks the return to hand-drawn animation from the revered team of John Musker and Ron Clements, with music by OscarÂ®-winning composer Randy Newman (&amp;quot;Monsters, Inc.,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Cars,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Toy Story&amp;quot;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot embed the trailer, but you'll get to it if you click on the link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8N-kIiELUA" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>461418</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264953998000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257950897000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Princess and the Frog</name><id>11849974</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261267200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/11849974/</event_url></item>
