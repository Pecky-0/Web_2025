Vocalist Dana Lauren will sing classic Sinatra big band arrrangements, transcribed and rescored specially for female vocals.  These include &amp;quot;The Way You Look Tonight&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I Could Have Danced All Night.&amp;quot;  (You can also catch Dana the following week at Scullers singing with Arturo Sandoval!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band plays from 9pm to midnight, and there will be a beginner swing dance lesson at 8:00pm.  No partner is required.  The lesson is a great opportunity for meetup members to meet each other (or at least the meetup members of the opposite sex) because the &amp;quot;followers&amp;quot; rotate through the &amp;quot;leaders&amp;quot; continuously throughout the hour-long lesson.  You will get to know dozens of people before the dance even starts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dance is hosted by &lt;a href="http://bostonswingcentral.org" target="_blank"&gt;Boston Swing Central&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Frank will be on stage conducting the band.
