In recognition of that, I'm changing our next meetup to Thursday, January 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the venue is changing as well.  In response to feedback, we are changing to a quieter, non-restaurant forum.  Andover-Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.&lt;br /&gt;You can get directions here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ants.edu/about/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://ants.edu/about...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a map of the campus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ants.edu/about/mapcampus.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://ants.edu/about...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this location is NOT handicapped accessible, as it entails climbing two flights of stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had an excellent meeting this month, and are all looking forward to continuing the momentum into the new year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the discussion at our first meeting, we'll be focusing on sharing NLP techniques with each other, coaching each other on ways to most effectively apply NLP, and actually using NLP with each other to generate change.  Both newcomers and experts are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168733115000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164369950000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Neuro Linguistic Programming December Meetup</name><id>5287773</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168560000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/5287773/</event_url></item>
