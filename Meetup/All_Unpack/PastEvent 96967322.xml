&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800000 ; font-size : large"&gt;Come over anytime after 3:00 ... the pizza's will be delivered around 4:00. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800000 ; font-size : large"&gt;If this changes your plans, please update your RSVP so that I don't order more than we can eat.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;Thursday is supposed to be sunny ... so let's get some exercise at Benson's Park.&lt;/span&gt; I will let "Mother Nature" guide your choice of hiking, snowshoeing, or cross country skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will travel at a moderate pace and keep to the flatter trails so that we can chat and enjoy the scenery along the way. Please dress warm enough and bring plenty of water. Hikers should bring cleats for their boots just in case it gets slippery. As always, everyone who participates at meetup events does so at their own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;After, we've had enough exercise, let's go back to my place for Pizza!&lt;/span&gt; I originally scheduled this event for December, but I was sick and had to cancel. I will provide the pizza and a large salad so all you have to bring is either an appetizer or a dessert to share. For those of you who can't make it for 2:00 but still want to join us for pizza, just come to my place at 4:00 so that I can get an accurate head count before ordering the pizzas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reach me on my cell (603) 540-7467 before I leave for Benson's or after we get back to my place. Unfortunately, my cell service at the park is limited to one bar, so we might not be able to connect during the meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : xx-large"&gt;HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet in the parking lot near the entrance.
