He has a schedule change. They are making him a company instructor (check airman) and he has to be in DC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I'll be providing an overhead shot using Google Earth and we can discuss options for off field landings departing all runways at FIT. Bring your thoughts on this. Locations are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we have the movie &amp;quot;Gathering of Legends&amp;quot;. We can view this after our business and discussion. This movie was made a couple years ago in Columbus Ohio during gatherings of P-51's and other legend aircraft. Should be quite interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also be discussing the possible Wings and Wheels from our last meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AirVentue raffle tickets are still on sale for The Big Weekend... Drawing will be at April's meeting.... Here's your chance to attend the Greatest Aviation event in the world.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, food at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon.&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ Hume</member_name><member_id>4096811</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Reinhart</member_name><member_id>6711977</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237725543000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234311140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association EAA Chapter 1454 March Meetup UPDATE</name><id>9716362</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237327200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/9716362/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/c/1/global_4198801.jpeg</photo_url></item>
