They seemed to have mixed reviews but nothing bad about the food mostly about the people who go there (but we will be there as a group anyway.)  I am saying Happy Hour because all of their appetizers are 1/2 off Monday - Friday 4 to 7pm in the Main Lounge.  I get off from work at 4pm and could head over there.  I am thinking a group of 10 for this event as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their appertizers actually look pretty darn good! :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking a Wednesday or Thursday night (but really Wednes).  Oh, did you see their Specialty Martini list - EndLess!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/Text Me but I will Check-In with updates as to what to look for!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Des</member_name><member_id>10861926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282171736000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280948347000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mid of the Week Happy Hour @ the Living Room</name><id>14319457</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282167000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/14319457/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/9/global_17140553.jpeg</photo_url></item>
