<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Well - the % chance of rain on Saturday keeps going down, so I'm going to take a chance and schedule this walk.   I have been wanting to walk the big loop at Ravenswood for a while now.  There will be a place part way in for folks who want a shorter walk to turn off back to the main trails.  Bring rainwear just in case.  If it's drizzling we'll go.  If a downpour will cancel.  Since I have no Internet after 3pm on Friday, here is my cell 978-269-4232&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location : Ravenswood Park in Gloucester, MA     Meet at the park entrance- Joan's silver Honda Fit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hike Details : An easy 4.8 mile loop - Magnolia Swamp Trail to Fernwood Lake Trail to Ledge Hill Trail - which will take us 2.5 to 3 hours to complete.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking boots are recommended, and it can't hurt to bring along bug spray.  Dogs are allowed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: From Route 128, take exit 14 (Route 133) and follow east towards Gloucester for 3 mi. until it dead ends into Route 127. Turn right onto Route 127 and follow for 2 mi. to entrance and parking area (12 cars) on right.   Also can park along the road if the lot is full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/357_ravenswood_park.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Silver Honda Fit</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joan C</member_name><member_id>5518283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242484965000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241523134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ravenswood Park Hike - Saturday May 9th</name><id>10341678</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241879400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/10341678/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/6/global_8499174.jpeg</photo_url></item>
