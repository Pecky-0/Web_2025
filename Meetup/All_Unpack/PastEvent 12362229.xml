Our goal is to summit via the North Slide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crampons, snowshoes, and an Ice Axe are required for this hike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we start up the slide and deem it too dangerous we will descend and summit via the Scaur Ridge and Pine Bend Brook trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will decide on the summit of Middle whether to descend via the South Slide or the Pine Bend Brook  and Scaur Ridge trails based on the conditons we find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hike at or slightly faster than book time with plenty of short stops (in order to stay warm) for food and water. Plan on food/snacks that you can eat while moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check your maps and AMC White Mountain Guide for a description of the trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody considering joining should be experienced in Winter hiking for longer distances, be comfortable hiking after dark, breaking trail in deep snow, bushwhacking around blowdowns, and be knowledgable in the proper Winter gear required for such an endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for full Winter conditions - snowshoes, crampons, microspikes, goggles, extra gloves/clothes may all be needed - plan your hike accordingly based on your experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions on equipement or the hike please ask before showing up for the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob &amp; Geri</member_name><member_id>4842806</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264613933000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263917801000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tripyramids via North Slide - ADVANCED</name><id>12362229</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264167900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12362229/</event_url></item>
