Sick of cooking? Or just looking for a night out with food and conversation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very spontaneous dinner plans for this Friday night. I have a craving for Twist (and personally for their wheat/gluten-free menu). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone care to join? Possibly stop on Thayer or Wickenden post-dinner for a beverage. If you don't join for dinner, but want to meet after contact me for my cell info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep the conversation manageable the rsvp is limited. Please bring cash so we don't have to worry about the check. And please make sure you show up if you rsvp because I'll call ahead for the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!&lt;br /&gt;val&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/4/09 1:30PM&lt;br /&gt;This meetup has moved earlier to 5:30. For those interested in joining up later, you will need to contact one of the other rsvp-ers. I'm heading to a last minute invite to Cambridge for a long-time friend's party after dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265630005000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259709079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Twist</name><id>11993920</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259965800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11993920/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
