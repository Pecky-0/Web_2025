We are inviting a limited number of participants to a small group presentation by IES. The IES team will be demonstrating their Virtual Environment energy analysis platform and discussing Revit integration. While our last session looked at Autodesk products such as Green Building Studio and Ecotect, this is another important platform that is making big strides towards offering BIM integrated energy feedback. For those folks who are energy focused, looking for early stage feedback, and want to survey other options besides the Autodesk offerings - Please sign up! More on IES Here: "Global thought leaders in measurable sustainability. We help businesses reduce the carbon emissions of buildings like nobody else can. We enhance our customers' triple bottom line: economic, social and environmental - shaping a sustainable future, today". &lt;a href="http://www.iesve.com/software" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.iesve.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Enter Box Office Unit #104 off of the North side parking lot on the 1st floor.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Wade Keating</member_name><member_id>8961244</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337818647000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Revit Users</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Rhode-Island-Revit-Users-Group</urlname><id>1414420</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Revit Users Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326825667000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special Session - IES VE Energy Analysis for Revit</name><id>48471442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329345000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Revit-Users-Group/events/48471442/</event_url></item>
