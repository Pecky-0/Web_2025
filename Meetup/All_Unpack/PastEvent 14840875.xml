<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A lovely Fall &lt;b&gt;2-day&lt;/b&gt; hike on the Appalachian Trail (AT) starting at Bear Mtn. State Park and heading southbound into Harriman State Park to East Mombasha Rd. for a total of about 17.6 miles. This is the next segment of the AT southbound for the group. We'll spend the night at a shelter or tenting area near the trail (you need a tent just in case or must arrange to share with someone). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, third time offered is the charm and I will do this hike! ;-) I just need at least one other person to go which a vehicle so we can place a vehicle at the end. Come on people, this is Fall, lovely leaves and weather! :-) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day we would start out on Seven Lakes Drive on the south side of Bear Mtn. We would hike 10 miles to the Fingerboard Shelter on Fingerboard Mtn. If there is room we'd stay in the shelter. If there isn't, we must tent for the night at the shelter. The second day is easier with only 7.6 miles of hiking. Should be done by about 2 or 3 PM at East Mombasha Rd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, and individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike and may necessitate backup plans if any member of the party runs into significant issues or if there are weather related issues that spring up. I have been conservative with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonably fit, experienced, and equipped we should come in earlier than I estimated.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES ==&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Full pack &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable, and broken in &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing -Avoid cotton as it stays wet (this includes underwear).
