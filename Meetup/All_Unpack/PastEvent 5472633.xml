THE NEXT MEETUP IS STILL IN APRIL, 2007!  THE LAST MEETUP WAS IN DECEMBER, 2006.  IT'S STILL TOO COLD!!!  BRRRRRR...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PUG MEETUP ORGANIZER!  &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Creeley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we PROACTIVE, or what? That's right, the next meetup isn't until April, 2007! As much as our Pugs want to go on playing together right through the cold winter months, the human members of this meetup would rather wait for warmer weather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST MONTH'S MEETUP... &lt;br /&gt;The December meetup was held at Clovis's place in Brockton, MA. It wasn't too cold (for a New England December!), but it was cold enough to keep most people home! However, several lucky Pugs did come out to play, while their owners braved the early winter weather. Thanks to all who came, and to John and also Charley for providing the goodies! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have!  If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend.  Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it because of all the fun that we (Pugs and people alike) have!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541007000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171224817000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug March Meetup</name><id>5472633</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173636000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5472633/</event_url></item>
