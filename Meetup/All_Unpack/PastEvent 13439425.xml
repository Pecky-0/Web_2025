However, with so many different applications/programs in the suite, there is sometimes a little confusion as to which app does what.&lt;br /&gt;This month's meeting will give an overview of what program is typically used for what (ie, Photoshop for digital images), as well as some of the cool new features in each of the programs. Most of the CS5 Design as well as the CS5 Web suites will be highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;Software and book giveaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: We usually meet in Webster Hall, Room 106. Sometimes circumstances beyond our control (such as the room is somehow double booked) require us to move to plan B.
