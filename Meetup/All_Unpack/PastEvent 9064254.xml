Yes again, he's given us a nice home to meet at- thank you Jeff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of the month? How about- Let's not have our MeetUp on Thanksgiving day?! Thanks Casey and Don for pointing  that out! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's have a party around modifiers- light modifiers- camera modifiers - anything having to do playing in photography! An example would be a &amp;quot;Gary Fong&amp;quot; flash modifier. Really any 3rd party do-dad that modifies light from either a flash, strobe or sun. Or possibly a camera modifier such as a &amp;quot;lens baby&amp;quot; etc. I'll be bringing my own DIY beauty dish I made for my flash. You are welcome to bring anything you've created as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring it in and share...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scotty&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Scott and I are always to try to greet everyone who comes to the meetups.
