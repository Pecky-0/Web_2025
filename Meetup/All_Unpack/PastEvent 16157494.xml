I will be going to the  Cyclones Arena and hope that some of you will join me!  Itâ€™s always so much more fun when we do things as a group.  &lt;br /&gt;The public skating takes place at 3:00 and last till 4:20.  Feel free to join us anytime between those hours.  After the event, we will decide on a nearby venue for a hot drink, snack or light meal  and great conversation with  good company.  &lt;br /&gt;Please remember to wear layers and gloves, so that you will stay comfortable and warm.  I hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is $5.00, call the center to inquire about the rental rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you will be renting skates, I recommend that you bring extra socks, to be sure that your feet are &amp;quot;cushioned&amp;quot; comfortably into the skates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cyclones Arena is located at 20 Constitution Dr, Hudson NH. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296466160000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295826049000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ice Skating in Hudson, NH</name><id>16157494</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296416700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/16157494/</event_url></item>
