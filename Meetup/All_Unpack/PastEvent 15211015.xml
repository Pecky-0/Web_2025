Teachings include the Dieties, mantras, Bhatki &amp;amp; Shatki, the Dattatreya approach to Kirtan and lots and lots of chanting. All workshop participants receive a 30 page handout titled 'A Bhakti Yoga Perspective on Kirtan'. This workshop deepens chanting practice while enriching knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiential workshop, the teachings allow you to connect your understanding with personal experiences. And together, we will chant in harmony, raise energetic vibrations and share uplifted consciousness as a community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Cohen leads Kirtan in a manner that blends Eastern spirituality and Western musical influences. Eastern spirituality is represented by Sanskrit mantras that calm minds and opens hearts and Western musical sensibilities are represented by musical influences such as funk, soul, rhythm and blues, jazz and rock.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This incredible workshop will be happening one day only so please register to secure your spot. Mike will also be available for somatic bodywork sessions Nov 17-21st.

Kirtan is fun and easy, and no prior experience is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirtan with Mike Cohen is an invitation to sing, clap, meditate and dance together to create deep connection to the secret places of your soul.  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ISwq00Erc" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Tube Video of Mike &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike's music is an expression of the Dattatreya lineage of Swami Kaleshwar and Shirdi Sai Baba as transmitted through the teachings of Philip Lipetz, author and one of Sri Kaleshwar's most senior Western students.
