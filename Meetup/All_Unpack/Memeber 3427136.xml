I'd love to develop a social network but find if I can't include my dogs at an event, I often don't attend.  Oh, one more thing, I work weeknights so weekends are my time to play.</bio><hometown>Amherst</hometown><topics /><name>Marc</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>3427136</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Amherst</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/3427136</link><visited>1369497922000</visited><lon>-72.47</lon></member>
