Several of Beantown Swing Orchestra's band members played the national anthem at Fenway at one of the postseason games against the Angels, and some play in the brass band on Yawkey Way during home games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYC vocalist Alex &amp;quot;Big Al&amp;quot; Hanon will be featured at this dance as he performs classic Sinatra big band charts. This is a special chance to catch him if you missed his performance with the Beantown Swing Orchestra at the North End's Italian Festival on August 12.  Many said it was the best performance ever by this band, and it was attended by hundreds - including Red Sox outfielder Coco Crisp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a beginner swing dance lesson at 7:45pm with Jay and Sarah Provost, and the band plays from 9pm to midnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, including driving directions, check out Swing City's website at &lt;a href="http://www.wannadance.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.wannadance.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Sox, and swing hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193615332000</updated><rating><average>2.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Swing Dancers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>swingdancing-110</urlname><id>549506</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston-Area Swing/Blues Dance Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193191407000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swing Dance at Swing City in Newton, Mass.</name><id>6606283</id><headcount>200</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193442300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/swingdancing-110/events/6606283/</event_url></item>
