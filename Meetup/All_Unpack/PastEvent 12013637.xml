<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a self guided tour that includes several inns, bed and breakfasts, shops, etc. in several towns in the Monadnock area of NH. At each stop there will be cookies and/or other refreshments and recipes. The cost is $8 per person(cash or check only) and you will need to bring a container for cookies to take home. We probably won't get to all of the stops by 4pm. We had a great time doing this last year but it won't be the same without an ice storm!! For a list of all the stops and more information go to currierandivescookietour.com. We can meet at exit 4 in Londonderry and in Nashua. We will need drivers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy </member_name><member_id>3699089</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260825669000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259890497000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Currier and Ives Cookie Tour</name><id>12013637</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260633600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/12013637/</event_url></item>
