Point Street called me and just told me that they want us to go for it! They want us to bring in 80 people if we can, so ya know what, that`s what we are gonna try and do! Blame it on me, and say I was being too conservative, or whatever, it doesn`t matter. Lets go for an attendance record!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get to the door, you can give them my name, and say that you are with meetup, but even with that distance I will bet that our very large group might be visible to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover for Point Street is $5.00, at the door. Also, if you know you are going to be late then let us know as Jodi did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the waiting list, and the attendee limit are off!&lt;/p&gt;
