If there are no Yes RSVP's to this on Saturdays I will cancel that morning as we can go locally where there will definitely be other dogs to play with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite dog park because it's in a beautiful natural setting in the woods. It's only a short hike to it so we get to enjoy a nice walk beforehand.  Just be careful when using google or a GPS as I was directed by them to enter the park on the opposite side from the entrance via non-passable &amp;quot;paths&amp;quot;.  I have found using The Pines Restaurant as a direction point when mapping it is a great way to find it easily as it's just down the street from the Park. There is plenty of parking too!  Look for my blue Yaris or a green CRV and my black lab Beau.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us near the parking lot or horseshoes.
