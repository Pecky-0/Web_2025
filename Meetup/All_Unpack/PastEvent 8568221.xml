Lots of great lobbying can happen at this time that will impact animal welfare. We want you to know the most effective ways to get involved and communicate your message. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will show you basic &amp;quot;lobby&amp;quot; techniques for citizen activists and provide information regarding some of the activities happening this year. We will also look to the next session, which begins in January of 2009, and review possible legislation concerning issues such as farm animal welfare, puppy mills, and wildlife related legislation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join me and bring a friend!   RSVP here so that I can plan on how many handouts to bring!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be upstairs in Room 316</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222208598000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219068641000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lobby 101 for Animals in Portland!</name><id>8568221</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221687000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/8568221/</event_url></item>
