These vaccinations include: DHLPP, Bordatella (canine cough) and Rabies. &lt;u&gt;Please ensure that your dog is healthy and current on all vaccinations before coming to the meet ups!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily McHugh </member_name><member_id>6348089</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227472181000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-41</urlname><id>404601</id><group_lat>41.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>The North Attleboro Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222015556000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Halloween Meetup Party at Off The Leash </name><id>8801910</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225047600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-41/events/8801910/</event_url></item>
