Have you already done so, but don't really know how to use it, so are still using it as a &amp;quot;point and shoot?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Gayle Lee will demonstrate some of the basics of digital SLR cameras as well as explain some of the sometimes confusing topics of speed, f-stops, depth of field and focusing, to mention just a few things.&lt;br /&gt;She will demystify some of the settings for you as well as give some words of advice on inspiration and perspective.&lt;br /&gt;Even &amp;quot;point and shoot&amp;quot; camera users can benefit from learning some of the settings that are available (but hardly ever used) on their own cameras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://groups.adobe.com/posts/9eab64a64b" target="_blank"&gt;http://groups.adobe.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:  This month only!!!!
