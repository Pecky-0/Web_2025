<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Russ’ offer to host, we will be having a Ticket to Ride game night at the end of this month. Ticket to Ride is a terrific game. Players build cross-country train routes in an effort to connect cities before other players’ routes block them from doing so. The more routes you build and the longer they are, the more points you earn. You will be making strategic decisions during every one of your turns, but it’s also an easy game to learn and plays fairly quickly once you get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathy has both the original Ticket to Ride game and the Ticket to Ride: Europe version and it now appears that we also have another version so we can accommodate up to 15 people (or up to five per game). In addition to the games, Cathy will be bringing the train cake she makes for her nephew, and there will be some salty snacks available as well. If you would like additional snacks, please feel free to bring them. Drinks are BYOB, and, as always, we request that each person contribute $1 toward the group’s Meetup fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>PLEASE USE SIDE DOOR</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy</member_name><member_id>25472152</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russell</member_name><member_id>43507082</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349018523000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347257819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>All Aboard!
