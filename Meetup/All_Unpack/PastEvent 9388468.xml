Lets get together for the final regular season game and cheer on our Bears for a fourth consecutive victory and hopefully a playoff spot.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can not find me you can call me on my cell phone @ 315-506-0040.  I hope everyone had a great holiday, and I look forward to seeing you all on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Chicago Bears T-shirt and try to have a meetup sign with me.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239060650000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Chicago Sports Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Chicago-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1195793</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Chicago Sports Club of New England</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230272061000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Week # 17  Bears vs. Texans</name><id>9388468</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230487200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Sports-Club/events/9388468/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/3/global_5815875.jpeg</photo_url></item>
