&lt;p&gt;For those of you not familiar with SITN's lecture format, lectures are free, accessible, and open to the public. All lectures are given entirely by graduate students at Harvard and focus on hot topics in science research and news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All lectures are on Wednesdays starting at 7 PM at the Armenise Amphitheater at Harvard Medical School. They are 2 hours in length, with a 10 minute break in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will have light refreshments before the lecture (coffee, tea, cookies, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 Fall Schedule is as Follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 19:  Broken Genes: The Role of DNA Repair in Preventing Cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 26:  Big Love: Monogamy and Promiscuity in the Animal Kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 3: How Evolution Generates "Endless Forms Most Beautiful"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 10: Biotechnology and the Emergence of New Therapeutics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 17: Living Foods: The Microbiology of Food and Drink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 24: The Universe is a (Pretty Big) Box: From Cells to Galaxies using Supercomputers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 7: Clean Energy of the Future: Solar cells, Biofuels and Fuel Cell Catalysts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 14: Thinking about Thinking: the Science of Decision Making from an Economics and Neurobiology Perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 28:  What's in Your Genes: Whole Genome Sequencing and its Impact on Personalized Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best way to get there is by T.  The closest Green Line stops are the E train at Longwood Medical Area, and the D train at Longwood.  The Harvard Medical School Quadrangle is on Longwood Avenue, across from the half traffic circle at Avenue Louis Pasteur.  The Armenise Amphitheater is the first building on the left (facing into the quadrangle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is parking at the Masco Garage at 375 Longwood.  Evening rate is $7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll gather on the benches outside the main entrance of the Courtyard Cafe (or in the lobby if it's wet out). We'll hang out there until about 6:45, then go in to get seats and refreshments before the lecture.  Afterwards, they usually have lab tours, or if anyone's up for more food, drinks, and socializing in the 9:00 hour or so, there's a Bertucci's down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the SITN website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us at 7:00pm this Wednesday (October 24th) for The Universe in a (Pretty Big) Box: From Cells to Galaxies Using Supercomputers. This talk presents the general concept of supercomputing (or High-Performance Computing) and how it is used to address complex research questions across a wide range of scales from the microscopic to intergalactic. As examples, the team of three lecturers will present how we use state-of-the-science high performance computing to address the science of blood flow, global weather, climate &amp;amp; air-quality, and the formation of galaxies and the largest structures observed in the universe. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Scientific evidence indicates that the laws of physics are the same in systems throughout the entire Universe – whether those systems be microscopic, or intergalactic. Thus, the same principles apply here on Earth as in distant galaxies. Our understanding of, for example, fluid dynamics or gravity can be applied across boundaries that otherwise make different systems seem unrelated. In this presentation, we demonstrate how the application of supercomputing makes these systems – spanning vast ranges in scale from blood flow to global weather and climate and all the way to galaxy formation – accessible to science. We also demonstrate how their seemingly endless complexity requires number-crunching power of modern supercomputers which has only become available within the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll gather on the benches outside the main entrance of the Courtyard Cafe (or in the lobby if it's wet out).
