Camille’s (Catherine Deneuve) life is shattered when her son is killed in a car accident. Unable to come to terms with it, she becomes attached to Franck (Thomas Dumerchez), her son’s best friend, who was also responsible for the tragedy. Camille’s friends and family do not understand her attitude. She finds herself alone. So what if people are shocked? Franck becomes the consenting object of her affections.
