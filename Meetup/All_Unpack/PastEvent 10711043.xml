Please join me for a tour of beautiful Rockport Harbor Massachusetts and paddle to Thacher Island on Saturday June 27th at 1pm

This is a 3 1/2 hrs / 4 mile paddle and NO Experience is Necessary
 
Located a half-mile off the eastern shore of Cape Ann, Thacher Island has something for everyone. After circling the island to view its high granite cliffs and towering lighthouses, kayakers can land on the west-shore ramp and enjoy a tour.  The 50-acre island contains a National Wildlife Refuge, and birders will love wandering the extensive trails and observing the variety of species that nest on or visit the island.  Thacher hosts two lighthouses, the only operating twin lighthouses remaining in America. The North Tower is on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public. Visitors who climb the 155 stairs to the catwalk, 166 feet above the sea, are treated to a fantastic view of the Atlantic coast from Boston to Maine
