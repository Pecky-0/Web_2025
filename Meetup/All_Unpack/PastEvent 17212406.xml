&lt;p&gt;About the book "True Love: A Practice for Awakening the Heart" by Thich Nhat Hanh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book of March. It is a simple, yet deep book with valuable  concepts about the nature of real love. The author explores the four key  aspects of love as described in the Buddhist tradition: loving  kindness, compassion, joy, and freedom - explaining how to experience  them in our day-to-day lives. He also emphasizes that in order to love  in a real way, we must first learn how to be fully present in our lives,  and he offers simple techniques from the Buddhist tradition that anyone  can use to establish the conditions of love.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Celine</member_name><member_id>4475598</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304345382000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>"True Love: A Practice for Awakening the Heart" by Thich Nhat Hanh</why><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>newearth</urlname><id>1147858</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7200012207</group_lon><name>New Earth Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302132160000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Meeting</name><id>17212406</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304118000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newearth/events/17212406/</event_url></item>
