<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a wonderful roughly 2.5 mi. vista hike I did twice last fall and have been meaning to do again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start out In the Giufrida Park parking lot at 2 PM and hike past the dam for Crescent Lake. This part may be a little wet as we have to cross below the dam where the trail crosses the spillway. Then we hike up the steep side of the ridge and climb only about an easy 10 feet or so of traprock cliff face. The path to climb is very easy with lots of secure places for feet and hands and can barely be called climbing. The reward is great though as at the top on Chauncey Peak is a WONDERFUL vista of the whole valley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail follows the cliff edge to the north with a great view of the lake below and Lamintation Mtn. on the other side of the lake. Eventually, as we get past the lake, the trail will cut down steeply from the ridge line. There is no climbing, but you need to watch your step lest you slip on leaves or scree and slide a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path continues into the forest and up the side of Lamintation Mtn. and we then turn south following the topography. We eventully decend and down by the side of the lake and finish with a pleasent walk through the old evergreens at lakeside and get back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll roughly estimate this hike to be a beautiful 1.5 hrs. but the actual distance is uncertain as I don't have a good map for the trail here. We'll stop for dinner afterwards (loc. TBD) at about 4 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S is the lead on this hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no good map for the park and trails that I can find. The link provided takes you to a topographic map of the area centered on Chauncey Peak. Older maps (this topo link included) list the lake as being named Bradley Hubbard Reservoir . You can zoom out on the map by changing the View Scale on the left to 1:50,000 or a little higher to get a context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail is not well marked, especially on Lamintation Mtn. A careful eye is needed for finding the white blazes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from the Hartford area:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-91 S&lt;br /&gt;* Take the MIDDLE ST. exit- EXIT 20- toward COUNTRY CLUB RD. (go .2 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* Turn LEFT onto MIDDLE ST. (go &amp;lt;.1 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* Turn RIGHT onto COUNTRY CLUB RD. (go 1.6 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* COUNTRY CLUB RD. becomes WESTFIELD RD. (go roughly .6 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* The entrance to Giuffrida Park will be on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;amp;n=4603131&amp;amp;e=686860&amp;amp;s=25&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;datum=nad83&amp;amp;layer=DRG25" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;amp;n=4603131&amp;amp;e=686860&amp;amp;s=25&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;datum=nad83&amp;amp;layer=DRG25" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.topozone.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1146679126000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike to Giufrida Park, Crescent Lake, &amp; Chauncey Peak in Meriden CT</name><id>4921416</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1147024800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4921416/</event_url></item>
