Much Ado About Nothing is a comedy by William Shakespeare. First published in 1600, it was likely first performed in the winter of 1598-1599 and it remains one of Shakespeare's most enduring plays on stage. Stylistically, it shares many characteristics with modern romantic comedies including two pairs of lovers: the romantic leads, Claudio and Hero, and their comic counterparts, Benedick and Beatrice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Nothing" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nashuatheatreguild.org/summer.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nashuathea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play starts at 12:00, but we need to be there by 11:00 to get good seats.
