&lt;p&gt;This event takes place at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, at Phillips Auditorium, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge. Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;strong&gt;get there early . . . even before 6:45 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the "staff only" signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Harvard stop on the MBTA Red Line, take any bus or trackless trolley going west on Concord Avenue in Cambridge (Arlmont Village and Belmont Center&amp;nbsp;buses; Huron Avenue trolley) and get off at the Observatory Hill stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information and directions,&lt;/strong&gt; go to&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. (If you are in the separate screening room, turn right after you exit and walk toward the courtyard, then look for signs pointing the way to the telescopes.) You can also look for me and my meetup sign while we are waiting in line to look through the telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of nighttime objects to observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Event&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, November 3, 2011, &lt;span style="color : #19294b"&gt;"CfA's Fall/Winter Sky Guide," Sue French, author/contributing editor,&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Sky &amp;amp; Telescope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Join us tonight for a preview of what's up in the skies over New England in the coming months. We'll check&amp;nbsp;where things are in our solar system, what constellations are easily visible, and what interesting deep-sky objects you can see with binoculars and small telescopes. And as a bonus, you'll learn how to image the sky with your iPhone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;******************************&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup sign. I usually find a seat at the left rear of the lecture hall; look for me there. After the lecture (and weather permitting), we will meet in the courtyard or in the telescope lines up on the observatory roof.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>74173</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marianne</member_name><member_id>9387943</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>9</waitlist_count><updated>1320438772000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1314308534000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CfA/Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory: Special Event</name><id>30948821</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1320360300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/30948821/</event_url></item>
