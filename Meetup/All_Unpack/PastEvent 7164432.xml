We will not accept &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; responses for this ticketed event but hope you will commit to joining us for some laughs and good company! If you respond yes &lt;u&gt;you must pay Chuck&lt;/u&gt; for your ticket when you arrive as he will purchase them in advance and reserve tables. Thanks Chuck for doing this, paying in advance for all of us is above and beyond but a clear message about the fine people in this meetup group! ;-) If you choose to join in at the last minute (after Wed Jan 30) please come along but you will need to purchase a ticket at the door and hopefully we can squeeze you in at our tables...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Comedians:&lt;br /&gt;Greg Boggis and Ric Cormier&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Back by Popular Demand&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;PAUL D'ANGELO - Stand-up comedian / writer / actor &amp;amp; former Assistant DA &amp;amp; criminal-defense counsel&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cash bar with Music&lt;br /&gt;and a Fun Filled Night&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;$20 per Person Donation&lt;br /&gt;for Lions Eye Research&lt;br /&gt;and Related Charities&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202498405000</updated><rating><average>4.78999996185</average><count>19</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
