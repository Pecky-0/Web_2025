I went there for dinner the other night, and I was really impressed.  It is the perfect place to linger over a glass of wine or cocktail and talk to friends (they also have several beers, I should add).  The food was also wonderful - they offer a 'small plates' menu with a wide variety of styles of food (and prices lol - so don't be too scared by the fancy decor). Speaking of the setting though - some of you may remember nikitta's(sp?), which is the restaurant that used to be in that same space.  They had good food, and a pretty good atmosphere, but the space itself was broken up in a disjointed way, and the colors were a bit dark.  Now they've literally knocked down a a wall or two  to make it spacious, sexy and warm.  I can't wait for everyone to come and see it : )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;The wonderful event coordinator Sasha is giving us some fabulous deals.  They've graciously offered to extend their normal great happy hour deals just for us from 6pm-???(when we leave) (because they're cool like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The specials are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$4 House Wine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their ENTIRE specialty cocktail menu.... $4 each (woo hoo!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pear-Tini&lt;br /&gt;Decadent Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;Apple Pucker&lt;br /&gt;Cherry-Tini&lt;br /&gt;Orange Mojito&lt;br /&gt;Firtini&lt;br /&gt;Classic Margarita&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;a href="http://press200.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://press200.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally can't wait until Monday.
