&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come join us for an evening of some unique wines that are really food friendly.  Think strong fatty cheeses, charcuterie, full-bodied appetizers, or even spicy finger foods when considering your appetizer donation!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357934619000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356043184000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Tasting:  "Orange" Wines</name><id>96075692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357862400000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/96075692/</event_url></item>
