<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Although this isn't a traditional dining out meetup, some members expressed some interest. I will be holding a purse party at my apt. in Quincy. &lt;br /&gt;

 The representative will bring between 30-40 bags and accessories, of different styles and colors. Prices are reasonable, ranging from $19-$135. If you don't see what you like, you can also order online. Check out the website, beijobags.com. &lt;br /&gt;

 I've had 4 purses over the past 8 years or so (not because they wear down, just because I love them), and get compliments where ever I go. &lt;br /&gt;

 Because this is not a traditional event, there are no event fees, and feel free to bring a guest. Just RSVP so I know how many people to cook for, and yes... I will be cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So come and check out the bags, and hang out with us for an afternoon. And if you don't want to buy, no big deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will email my address to Yes RSVPs close to the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Debbi  </member_name><member_id>22304061</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359242714000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354453433000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Purse Party</name><id>93713442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359223200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/events/93713442/</event_url></item>
