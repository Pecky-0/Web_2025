We are pleased to announce our fourth Meetup Game Nite. All Meetup groups are welcome to participate. Let's see if we can get over 100 people at this event! (Last game nite we had 80...) This is a great way to mix and mingle with old and new friends, and perhaps learn something about other meetup groups in the area! So grab your favorite board games, a deck of cards, and anyone that you want to bring for an early night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the following meetup groups are participating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/"&gt;Social Fun&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/FUNgirls"&gt;Girls Just Want to Have FUN!&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonCards"&gt;Boston Cards and Conversation &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inquisitiveminds.org/"&gt;Inquisitive Minds &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boardgames.meetup.com/434/"&gt;Beantown Gamers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetin.org/city/MEETinBOSTON/index.cfm"&gt;MeetIn Boston&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to ask the organizers of your other groups if they are participating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any card and board games are welcome. Apples to Apples is always a hit at Social Fun game nights. Those of you who love cards, but don't quite remember how to play, don't despair! Members of Boston Cards and Conversation are always willing to teach old and new card games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mafia has been a hit at the past events and will surely be played again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't stay at home and watch TV, come out and have some FUN with us. And if you're going out on Friday night, the event is early enough that you can come socialize, play a few games, and then hit the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come for dinner, ice cream, or just games and socializing! Since this is an open event, come early, come late, stay for a bit, stay for the whole event, anything goes! Games last until 9:30 or so, and many people go out for drinks and food after the event...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the rear of Food Court next to Pizzeria Regina.
