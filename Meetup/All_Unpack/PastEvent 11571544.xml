In addition to being a great singer/songwriter, he's also one hell of a guitarist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer had this to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Gearan has a deep, drawling voice that quickly wins you over. His ragtime cover of &amp;quot;Sittin' on Top of the World&amp;quot; and James Taylor's &amp;quot;Lo and Behold&amp;quot; are further highlights, though most of his tunes are original and testify to his hard-gigging talent. He also plays Fridays at Atwood's Tavern in Cambridge in a more stripped-down setting.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His friday shows at Atwood's are really something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on out for some seriously good music.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>8876864</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255581171000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254928742000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tim Gearan Band at Atwood's Tavern</name><id>11571544</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255140000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/11571544/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/a/global_10830698.jpeg</photo_url></item>
