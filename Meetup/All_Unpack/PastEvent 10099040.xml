Here, there are films about activism and inspiration, about the challenges facing wildlife, and about the people standing up to those challenges. The Film Festival sits apart by leaving you feeling engaged and motivated to go out and make a difference in your community and the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this year's first Wild and Scenic Environmental Film Festival, we will show environmental and adventure films that illustrate the Earth's beauty, the predicaments currently facing our planet, and the work communities are doing to protect it. Take, for example, the Oregon street program that involves neighbors in painting a huge canvas onto a busy intersection that is then festooned with art and used as a meeting place. Perhaps the story of the free bicycle system in Paris can inspire you to envision new possibilities for your street or neighborhood. Or perhaps the documentary of people in Appalachia fighting to stop mountain top removal of coal seams that are stripping old forests and destroying local fresh water systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; inc. - hosted Wild and Scenic Environmental Festival will take viewers across the globe as we see pristine coral reefs, mountain top coal mining, and activism by five young people preserving habitats around the globe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to an evening of delightful films, convivial company, delicious foods, and a chance to engage and enjoy.
