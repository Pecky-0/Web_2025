Many people come to JP on weekends especially for their brunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Center St Cafe is located at:&lt;br /&gt;669a Centre Street • Jamaica Plain, MA • 617-524-9217&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're taking public transport, the No. 39 Bus goes right by the Cafe. You can pick up the No. 39 bus at Copley Square, anywhere along Huntington Ave, or at the end of the Green E Line at Heath Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I need a firm Yes (or No) RSVP for Brunch by THURSDAY Sept. 4th so that we can coordinate with the restaurant accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info on the Cafe and their menus, see &lt;a href="http://www.centrestcafe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Center Street Cafe&lt;/a&gt;.
