Hmmmmm, well, maybe its undiscovered, but the crowd in the know already knows about it. P-Collective first-timers, you'll remember where it is and if you don't know about it yet, its worth knowing about........ So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a black polka dot  scarf, but we're not hard to find!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
