<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Urban Shamanism is the contemporary application of shamanic practices for use in healing, problem solving, self-discovery, and personal growth. It is a living, evolving system of healing tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tools transform and heal the conflicts between body, mind and spirit created by the chaotic pace of modern life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;organizer's note:&lt;br /&gt;This class is the most requested and well received class we give. I personally have given this discussion at Book Stores, Churches and Metaphysical shops, all to very positive gatherings. If there is a class you don't want to miss, this is the one!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247943690000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237304965000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Urban Shamanism</name><id>9972984</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247436000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9972984/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
