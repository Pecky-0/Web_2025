<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;World renowned artists are convening on Revere Beach for the 9th Annual National Sand Sculpting Festival. This is the largest sand sculpting event on the east coast. Over 500,000 spectators are expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have been invited by the chairman to record the event, works, festivities, and awards ceremony.&lt;/span&gt; There will be a limited number of Press Passes (TBD) for photographers who request and commit to providing a CD of their photos for this charitable event. Please RSVP if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also being announced through Boston Portrait Photographers Meetup Group. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need your flash to fill in shadows depending on your shooting angle and to enhance the appearance of the sculptures depending on the time of day and incident light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In place of a flash, this might be be a good opportunity to practice with your reflectors and with color highlights (silver and gold). Bring an assistant to help with the reflectors (or to at least carry water) and maybe get in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your camera. Shooting at the beach is fun, but sand and salt can wreak havoc on equipment. This is not a good place to be changing lenses, so plan ahead or get off the beach to make changes. If you have a camera raincoat, use it. It's not just for rain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also put your camera in a plastic bag (clear is better) screw in the lens hood over the plastic and then carefully (with a razor blade) trim the lens opening. If you have a UV filter, this is the time to use it to protect your lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean your lenses before you leave. When you return home, clean them out with an air can on manual blower - don't rub in the fine (microscopic) sand particles with a lens cloth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you might want to bring a compact umbrella - for shade, or just in case it rain (this is New England, you know, at least bring your Sun hat for the daytime events).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is activity from Friday July 6th (setup) to Sunday July 15th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
