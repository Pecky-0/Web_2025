&lt;p&gt;          This sounds like a nice event for both runner and walker alike. We could meet at 9:30 and the event will start at 10:00 a.m. The cost for pre registration is $20.00, and $25.00 for the day of the event. The foliage should be in full swing for this 5k run/walk, and 10k run. I expect a fair amount of walkers, so you do not have to be a runner to do this event. The event will start at 183 Howaqrd Hill Road near the Foster Fair Ground, and all proceeds will benefit the South Foster Volunteer Fire Department. For more information including registration click on the link below. From time to time I might try to post events that may be good for both running and walking. It looks like we might get to use our paypal accounts again, but the event is also payable by check.Following the event, we can be open to suggestions on where to go for lunch or a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
