<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For people like me who aren't going away for Memorial Day weekend, thought I'd schedule this day trip:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just found out about these cruises. This is a special longer tour that they only do until the end of June. My idea is to do this tour, then have lunch and walk around Salem and see historic homes and shops. Contact info for Mahi Mahi Cruises: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mahicruises.com/about/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mahicruise...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;800.992.MAHI (6244)/978.825.0001 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have to pay in advance, but you do have to make a reservation with a credit card to guarantee your spot. Cruises fill up quickly. Please let me know in your RSVP that you have made a reservation. For every 10 people, we get $1 off, so say you are with Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour leaves at 10 a.m. so we should be there at 9:30 a.m. and I will wear a Meetup button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Newburyport/Rockport Commuter Rail goes to Salem from North Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mbta.com/s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salem Lighthouse Cruise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two-hour cruise concentrating on Salem Sound’s historic lighthouses with a live and informative narration and exceptional views of Beverly’s Hospital Point Light, Marblehead Light, Salem’s Derby Light, Pickering Light, and secluded Baker’s Island Light which is best viewed by boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated Sightseeing Cruises bring Salem Sound to life through an informative yet laid-back narration by one of our knowledgeable crew. This is no recording so feel free to ask questions whenever. As we cruise by the beautiful shorelines of Salem, Marblehead, Beverly, Manchester-By-The-Sea and the Misery Islands you’ll learn of town history, the boom and bust of the local maritime industry, ocean life, historic landmarks and of course today’s latest gossip on all those multi-million dollar estates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On all cruises passengers are welcome to visit The Conch Shell Bar &amp;amp; Grill where there are plenty of bar options, refreshments and food choices. Cash and credit cards accepted on board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Departs 10 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;    * Two hours in length&lt;br /&gt;    * Costs: Adults $18&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and will be wearing a Meetup button.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>404606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275533970000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274624974000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salem Lighthouse Cruise</name><id>13568113</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275226200000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/13568113/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/2/global_15219250.jpeg</photo_url></item>
