Quincy Whitney, author of the book Hidden History of New Hampshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden in the cracks and crevices of the Granite State are the stories of pioneers who pursued their passions, creating legacies along the way. There is the tale of the mountain man who became an innkeeper; the Bird Man who took his passion to the White House; the gentleman who ascended the highest peak in the Northeast in a steam-powered locomobile; the story of one skier's dramatic win at the 1939 American Inferno Mount Washington race; the Shaker Meetinghouse, built in just one day, in complete silence; and the gallant efforts to save the Old Man of the Mountain. Quincy Whitney's compilation of stories makes for a colorful narrative of some of New Hampshire's most notable news-makers and remarkable historic events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This free event includes refreshments.  Kensington is located on New Hampshire's Seacoast and can be reached easily from 101 or 95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If members are interested we can get together for dinner following the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>7235827</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255783874000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254161756000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hidden History of New Hampshire</name><id>11488950</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255473000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11488950/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/4/global_10956756.jpeg</photo_url></item>
