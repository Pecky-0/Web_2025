As with every other NYC ballot initiative, the City of New York is denying the will of its people to vote on the issues it considers most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYC CAN responded by filing suit, and on September 9 the City conceded NYC CAN did in fact submit enough valid signatures to put the referendum before the voters. Now NYC CAN is battling to prove the petition is legally valid. On September 28, the referee will report on the petition's legality, and a final determination will be made in the days that follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of the referee's decision, let us take to the streets in the THOUSANDS on behalf of the families, first responders and survivors of September 11th and the 80,000 New Yorkers who signed the petition. As the climate ripens and public opinion continues to swing in favor of a new investigation, this is our opportunity to send a message like never before. If we stand together, we can make history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 27. 2pm. Battery Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are able to volunteer to hand out fliers for the march, starting&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, September 19, please email volunteer@nyccan.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://nyccan.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://nyccan.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://nyccan.org/MarchForAnswersFlier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://nyccan.org/Mar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://nyccan.org/MarchForAnswersB&amp;amp;W.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://nyccan.org/Mar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254261395000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253243138000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NYC CAN's Historic MARCH FOR ANSWERS 9-27-09 </name><id>11402908</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254074400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/11402908/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/6/global_981894.jpeg</photo_url></item>
