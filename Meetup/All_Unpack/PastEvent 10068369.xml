Aquarium (blue line), Haymarket (green &amp;amp; orange lines), State (orange &amp;amp; blue lines), Government Center (blue &amp;amp; green lines), and South Station (red line &amp;amp; commuter rail) subway stations are no more than a five (5) minute walk away. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below, I've copied some details from the group for which Biagio organizes.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kitty O'Sheas is one of the best spots to host another Mix and Mingle cross Meetup party for 160 members on Friday, April 24, 2009!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; a Singles party. So anyone can come that means couples are also welcome. Let's get to know one another, socialize, and dance.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;BE RESPECTFUL TO EACH OTHER AND DRINK RESPONSIBLY!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Music will be at a medium level in the main room upstairs and tuned very low in the back room, so members can have a separate area to chat. Be prepared for the music to be cranked up for dancing, which means, &lt;b&gt;IT WILL GET LOUD AFTER 9&lt;/b&gt;. So get there &lt;b&gt;EARLY&lt;/b&gt; if you want a chance for quiet conversation.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kitty O'Sheas is in Boston (near Faneuil Hall) 131 State St Boston, MA 02109 617-725-0100    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kittyosheasboston.com/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Kitty Link&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd floor can accommodate 160 people. There are 2 bars upstairs, 4 huge comfy couches, its own DJ area with light machine and dance floor as well as its own bathroom....the makings for our own private party.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biagio is ordering $200 worth of appetizers (wings/veggie platter, cheeses etc) because their Kitchen is small and it would be difficult to get enough food for 160 members, individually. Each appetizer platter will be refilled just once, so get there &lt;b&gt;EARLY&lt;/b&gt;, if you want some grub.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/b&gt;, whether you eat or not, please pay Biagio $5, to help cover the cost of this event, which includes renting the whole 2nd floor, 3 bartenders, and the DJ in addition to the food. Please find Biagio&lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/887/members/3847345/"&gt; (his photo)&lt;/a&gt; at the party to pay him. He is the ONLY person you should pay.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS ALWAYS YOU MUST MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon entry into the building Security will check your IDENTIFICATION, (after 9 you will also have to pay a $15 cover) then proceed to the bottom of the stairwell on your left, where you must check in with Security again. You will be able to enter upstairs by telling Security you are with the &lt;b&gt;Social Fun Group&lt;/b&gt; because that is how our party is registered.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the top of  the stairs be prepared to pay $5 to Biagio, so the line moves quickly and the stairs aren't blocked. If the line on the stairs becomes a problem, Security will make members go back downstairs.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstairs will open at 7, so if you arrive early hang at the downstairs bar for a bit. Line for upstairs will begin forming as early as 6:30. Each Mix + Mingle has reached capacity before 7:30, so get there &lt;b&gt;EARLY&lt;/b&gt;. If you arrive after 7:30 you may have to wait in a line downstairs before being allowed upstairs. Great reason to get there &lt;b&gt;EARLY&lt;/b&gt;.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;After 9 Kitty O'Sheas charges a mandatory $15 cover to enter the building. Remember, you will also have to pay $5 to Biagio, who will be upstairs.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The invited Meetup Groups are:    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/calendar/10017551/"&gt;Social Fun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/1169/calendar/10120022/"&gt;Beantown and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://euro.meetup.com/76/calendar/10037773/"&gt;Boston Euro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/"&gt;Brunch and More&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/1555/"&gt;Metro West Singles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were at least 175 members at each of the last few Mix and Mingle cross Meetup parties. There were also a few members who could not get in because they came late and it was full. So, RSVP now and arrive &lt;b&gt;EARLY&lt;/b&gt;.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;JOIN US FOR ANOTHER GREAT TIME!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The entire second floor has been reserved under the name Social Fun</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241130335000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>39</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238410570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Mix + Mingle Part 6</name><id>10068369</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240614000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/10068369/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/1/global_4320785.jpeg</photo_url></item>
