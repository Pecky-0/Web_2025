To join in the dog parade, show up near the Discovery Center at 1:30 to 1:45 pm, we will line up and march off at 2:00 pm.  We have some signs, or you can make your own.  Costumes for dogs and people are encouraged but not required.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be also food, music, and other entertainments.  Come one, come all, bring your friends and family (well behaved, leashed dogs are OK, too.)  It's basically free unless you choose to purchase food, drink, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MeetUp:  If you want to be in the Parade,  met at the Discovery Center, near Avenue A and 2nd Street, between 1:30 and 1:45 pm.  We march at 2:00 pm.  After the Parade, Kristi (and Martha, a black lab with a blue leash) will be milling around Main Street at the front of Peskeomuskut Park near the intersection of Avenue A and Seventh Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best parking is probably near Unity Park on 1st or 2nd street, (near start of parade), or in the Food City/Rite Aid Plaza just south of the Park at the corner of Avenue A and Seventh Street.(end of parade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.turnersfallsriverculture.org/2009/08/8/1012-Turners-Falls-Block-Party-and-Fashion-Show-/" target="_blank"&gt;Turners Falls RiverCulture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info, maps &amp;amp; directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rt 91 to Routes 5&amp;amp;10 North out of Deerfield, past Old Deerfield (HIstoric Deerfield?) over Green River Bridge bear sharp right, under railroad underpass -- this road becomes Avenue A in Turners &amp;amp; takes you into the center of downtown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, contact:Lisa Davol, RiverCulture Coordinator, 413-230-9910 or riverculture@montague.net&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the parade, Kristi  &amp; Martha, black lab w/blue leash will be near the at corner of 7th St. &amp; Ave.  A</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250445895000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248973256000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Turners Falls Block Party, Parade &amp; Fashion Show</name><id>10994264</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249754400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/10994264/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/3/global_9944259.jpeg</photo_url></item>
