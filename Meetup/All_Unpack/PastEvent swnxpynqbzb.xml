Look left and see Orleans Restaurant on the right hand side of the street. Walk about 1 minute and you're there! We'll be at a table or two, signing. Anyone who drives should know that there FREE parking on Sunday--you do not have to pay at the meter, and you can park on the street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be a celebration of all the fun we've had this past year in Boston ASL, so come ready to relax, drink, eat, and be merry. No gifts or cards are necessary! Just bring good cheer! And of course, feel free to invite your friends, roommates, etc. Anyone who can sign is welcome, but no voices (and that means YOU!). You can dress up or dress down, but this is a party, so come dressed for the holidays in some way ... COME ON! Get in the spirit guys!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginners and people who have never been to a Meetup, this one would be quite fun to come to, so come one--why not? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST officially RSVP, even if the RSVP is &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; so that we know who is definitely going to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be great to see folks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ, Connie, Erika, and Marc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEACE ...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Erika Wentworth</member_name><member_id>487803</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292954229000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>ASL Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonasl</urlname><id>1298565</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston ASL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277417746000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ASL Holiday Party</name><id>swnxpynqbzb</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292792400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonasl/events/14901116/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/1/global_16399809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
