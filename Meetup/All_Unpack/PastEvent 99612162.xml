Please join about 20 to 85 friends for an evening of dancing and socializing. This is the largest Singles Dances in NH, with between 200 and 400 singles, in a ballroom setting, not a Bar. Yet, it is not a ballroom dance. Meet and dance with the most tasteful variety of people and ages you will find anywhere. Because of the popularity of this Dance. Tables and seats are hard to hold, much past 8:30. Parking is also limited to only around 250 cars. So, bring your walking shoes. If you are late. Plus, the Cover Charge goes from $12 to $15 after 9 pm. Please get there as close to 8 pm as possible. I will do my best to introduce you. If you get there late, introduction become very difficult. Because by then we are all up on the dance floor. If itâ€™s your first time joining us, you can ask where the meetup tables are located. &lt;br /&gt;
