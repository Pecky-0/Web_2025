Union Restaurant in the South End has a prix fixe brunch for $9.95 from 10 to 11 on Sundays, and it's a short walk from the South End outdoor market. So after we've stuffed ourselves, anyone who feels inclined to do so can walk it off checking out the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather is nice, some of us are likely to drive to Alewife Station and take the T downtown. If not, well, the restaurant does have valet parking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but because of problems we have had with no-shows at our last two meetups, you must pay in advance via Paypal* in order to reserve your space. You have 24 hours from making your reservation to do this, otherwise you will lose your spot and someone from the waiting list will get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find out more about this restaurant at their web site: &lt;a href="http://www.unionrestaurant.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.unionresta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more about the South End market, go to: &lt;a href="http://www.southendopenmarket.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.southendop...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email address to use for Paypal: purrform@tiac.net&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in front of the restaurant by 9:45, reservation is for 10</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245019981000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243302494000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Brunch in the South End</name><id>10491266</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243777500000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/10491266/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/7/global_8808407.jpeg</photo_url></item>
