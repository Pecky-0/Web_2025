For directions or if you have questions, call Stephen (me) at 508-410-3172 or Marie at 508-269-6551. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another combo event..but this time it's a pond side bbq and my birthday! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's event will be at a beautiful pond right over the Leicester line in Spencer (only about 15/20 minutes from Worcester) It's a private home with a deck, grill and small dock that goes right into the water. There's possibility of a party boat and kayaks.. but the guarantee of a good time! :) You can bring bbq-able items (like fruit, kabobs, etc) but enough veggie burgers/veg dogs will be provided for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring a bathing suit! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******** Also...no more desserts!! lol We will have nothing but at this rate.  If you have already planned on it that's fine.. but everyone else please bring some kind of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; food instead, thank you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling will be available as always, just contact me in advance so it can be coordinated. Also try to RSVP as early as possible for this one so we can prepare for enough people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181063053000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178510681000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp June Meetup</name><id>5749476</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180890000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/5749476/</event_url></item>
