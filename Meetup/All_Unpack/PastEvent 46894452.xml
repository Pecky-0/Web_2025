I haven't been before so we'll be exploring with a small map...recommending a 3.5 mile walk which is about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in length and involving woodlands, pond and a hill...some of which is described as "rugged"...should be fun and weather forecast is good - sunny and about cool but not freezing.. Bald Hill reservation is not far off I-95 - take exit 51 - head for Middleton (south) and take first right on Middleton Road. Follow this 1.5 miles to parking lot on the left where there is a sign and a map.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a bright red jacket...red subaru.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326160138000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325819917000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bald Hill Hike in Boxford</name><id>46894452</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326034800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/46894452/</event_url></item>
