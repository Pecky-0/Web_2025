Do you tone down your atheism for religious friends and family at holiday gatherings? How do you handle the pre-meal prayer? Do you opt out of gatherings, or attend and bite your tongue? Have your religious friends and family ever changed their own behavior to try and respect your views? Share your stories, your approach(es) toward sticky situations, and how it has worked (or failed)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;At every Sunday topical meeting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What to expect: The monthly meeting typically begins with an introduction all around for the benefit of any first-time attendees, and discussion of any announcements, upcoming events, etc. We then move on to a topic of interest to atheists (usually) chosen beforehand. Sometimes participants bring print-outs of articles, research, or books to share on the topic, and sometimes people just come with stories or opinions to share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We loosely moderate the topical discussion to give everyone a chance to participate. Then the conversation often flows onto other related subjects, sometimes in smaller conversation groups around the table. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any ideas for meeting topics, please let any of the co-organizers know. We can also add announcements or &amp;quot;mini-topics&amp;quot; to the agenda if there's anything you'd like to share with the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the large group, some might be wearing atheistic shirts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul S</member_name><member_id>4811434</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie </member_name><member_id>7248057</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290436261000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287344521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Morning Topical Meeting--Dealing with religious friends and family</name><id>stgrpynpbcc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290353400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/15138498/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/2/global_10991506.jpeg</photo_url></item>
