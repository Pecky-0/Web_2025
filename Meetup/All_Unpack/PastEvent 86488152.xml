 For all you new folks that joined us Monday; thanks for coming. We know you had a good walk and you’ll be back again for another fun time! &lt;br /&gt;

 For anyone that would like to walk with us, just come on by and you’ll be introduced to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy walk, but consistency and stamina development is the key. So each week we’ll continue to walk, but increase our distance and/or activities a bit more. Last time (Oct 8th) we had a little longer walk than the week before of about 3 miles. So this week we’ll increase to 4+ miles (about 1 1/2 hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a great time walking and talking along the river with the foliage continuing to get more beautiful in colorful. In addition, a blue herring, a Carp, Canadian Geese, Ducks, Squirrels, Chipmunks, were all there with us as we admired them in&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/2/0/event_167954112.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; their natural habitats. There’s always something new to see. So let’s continue to enjoy this wonderful fall location, have fun, and get some easy exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finish our walk we can visit The Heritage Restaurant, just across the street, for a snack and hot beverage. Last week 8 of us enjoyed each others company over burgers. wraps, and salads. We had a lot of fun as we became new friends. We even had the unexpected pleasure of a poetry reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll meet between 5:30 - 5:45pm at the concert park benches just across the street from Heritage Ice Cream &amp;amp; Restaurant. For those that don’t know me, I’ll have a MEETUP pin on the back of my cap. If you come later, we’ll be walking, so just look for a group and ask everyone if they’re the MEETUP group. My cell # is; (603) 204-1657&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a DOG FRIENDLY WALK, so bring them along if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Ordway</member_name><member_id>4903547</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350351675000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349929186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Walk &amp; Talk Along the River!</name><id>86488152</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350336600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/86488152/</event_url></item>
