I know many of you have been here before, but hey, when its a good thing, its a good thing, and Trinity always delivers! Plus we haven't had a Monday Night Meetup here since the Collective beginnings in '08:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Rhode Island institution - need we say more. If you've been, you know. If you haven't, you'll find out. After all they &amp;quot;Sell Heaven By The Pint&amp;quot;. The food isn't bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This is a big place, I'll break out the blue fuzzy scarf and hopefully you'll find us!
