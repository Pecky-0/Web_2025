&lt;p&gt;Please dress to impress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refresments will be provided!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early to socialize and secure a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other meetup groups will be invited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$5 donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to help me set up and run this event please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the "Dating Game"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dating Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; television show that first aired on December 20, 1965 and was the first of many shows created and packaged by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Barris"&gt;Chuck Barris&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s_in_television"&gt;1960s&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_in_television"&gt;1980s&lt;/a&gt;. ABC dropped the show on July 6, 1973, but it resurfaced in several syndicated versions (1973–1974 as &lt;em&gt;The New Dating Game&lt;/em&gt;, 1978–1980, 1986–1989 and 1996–1999; repeats of the last version appeared in the 1999–2000 season.) For years it was almost always aired in tandem with another Barris production, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newlywed_Game"&gt;The Newlywed Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which premiered on ABC the following year. The show was a forerunner of a number of other shows themed in the same style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, a bachelorlette would question three &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor"&gt;bachelors&lt;/a&gt;, who were hidden from her view; at the end of the questioning period, she would choose one to go out with on a date paid for by the show. Occasionally, the roles would be reversed with a man questioning three ladies; other times, a celebrity would question three players for a date for themselves, a co-worker or a relative of theirs. Many celebrities played the game looking for love themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got three hot new bachelorettes and one tempting new bachelor!&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/6/c/event_189288492.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Come watch (or play) as participants are chosen straight from the audience! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Who's coming to party! Great drink specials and prizes all night! The show is free and the action begins promptly at 8pm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Totally worth it if we all survive the Mayan Apocalypse!&lt;/p&gt;
