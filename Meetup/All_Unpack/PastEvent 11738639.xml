I have no intention of singing but I know there are a few of you that definitely will, and some who will come along and enjoy the entertainment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razzy's is a dive bar near Porter Square and according to reviews it is has good Friday night Karaoke. It is a small place and fills up quickly so try not to arrive too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come along and enjoy a fun Friday night out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so I can work out if this is a good night to do it. If there is not much interest I may cancel for a later date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257789084000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256784697000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karaoke night - Razzy's at Porter Square</name><id>11738639</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257553800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/11738639/</event_url></item>
