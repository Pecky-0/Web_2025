See the free performance of As You Like It by the Citi Performing Arts Center in Boston Common with your fellow Boston Bookcrossers!  Meet at the Parkman Bandstand 6:30 p.m. (Take the green line or the red line to Park Steet Station.)  I'll be wearing a BookCrossing t-shirt and I'll have a small sign (8 1/2 x 11) that says &amp;quot;BookCrossing&amp;quot; with the Ballycumber logo on it (that's the little yellow running book). I'll hang around the bandstand for 20 minutes, and anyone who comes later than that can find us on the lawn -- I'll prop up the sign.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is the Parkman Bandstand: &lt;a href="http://z.about.com/d/boston/1/0/p/0/-/-/IMG_4150.JPG" target="_blank"&gt;http://z.about.com/d/...&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you might want to bring:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to sit on -- blanket, towel, lawn chair, or something  &lt;br /&gt;Food - picnic!  &lt;br /&gt;Beverage - refreshing, non-alcoholic  &lt;br /&gt;Bug spray - just in case  &lt;br /&gt;Registered books for release - we had a fantastic catch rate at this event last year  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely free!
