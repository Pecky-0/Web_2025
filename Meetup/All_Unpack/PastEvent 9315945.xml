These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It’s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Description &lt;br /&gt;The Passion of the Christ focuses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is free.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the Orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237160257000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228940319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie:  The Passion of the Christ</name><id>9315945</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236987000000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/9315945/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/7/global_6579959.jpeg</photo_url></item>
