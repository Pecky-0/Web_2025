<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Arts and Ideas festival, local musicians have entered a "rock lottery", where they have been randomly grouped with each other, and given only a couple weeks to practice together. There are five such bands, playing two songs each: one they picked, and one assigned. They're playing at Cafe 9 on Saturday night, and one of the groups includes the NHC's own Will Stadtler, yay!!! Let's come out and support him and our other neighborhood musicians for a fun night of music and merriment! See you there! &lt;br /&gt;
