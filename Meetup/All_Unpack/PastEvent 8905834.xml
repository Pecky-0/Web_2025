Especially with Halloween approaching? We will be attending the show at the Governors Inn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll love this outrageously entertain evening of gallows humor, song and dance. This is the show that would result if the Addams Family and the Munsters decided to do a musical review! It provides an outrageous look at the morbid and macabre. &lt;br /&gt;Thus Macab aret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cast of Corpses includes Phil Graves, Helena Handbasket, Maude Lynn and Paul Bearer, with songs entitled: Grave Mistake, Dead End Job, Boogie Woogie Boogie Man. RIP...you get the picture. Macabaret is fiendishly fun entertainment! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets: Only $30 including 4-course dinner, tax &amp;amp; gratuity! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please call: &amp;quot;The Governors Inn&amp;quot; at 603-332-0107 for reservations, mention that you want to sit in the Trailblazers reserved seating area!
