Gathering is at Howie's home in Glastonbury at 5:30 PM.  Howie plans to order pizza, so when you RSVP, let us know what you like on your pizza and he'll do his best to accomodate us all.  You can also suggest a movie that's recently (or even not so recently) released to dvd.  Since this event is in a private home, you must RSVP for directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220909489000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212936740000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Meeting and a Movie</name><id>8102856</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220736600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/8102856/</event_url></item>
