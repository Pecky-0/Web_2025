For our next meeting (JUNE 28) we continue to share and reflect on the book by Matthew Fox &amp;quot;One River, Many Wells&amp;quot;  - CHAPTER THREE: &amp;quot;MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS AND HOLY IMMAGINATION: ART AND RITUAL AS PATHS TO MINDFULNESS (pages 189-254). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you not able to read the material &amp;quot;assigned&amp;quot;, don't worry and come anyway. It has been my belief that our simple presence can still foster deep and creative interaction. Hope to see all of you on June 28. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, mark your calendars and hope to see you at the meeting. Enjoy this book and continuous blessings on your and your loved ones...  HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEACE&lt;br /&gt;Fr.
