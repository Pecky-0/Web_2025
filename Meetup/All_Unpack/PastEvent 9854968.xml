<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be my first walk as an Assistant Organizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Dunks next to the Kenmore stop and walk down Beacon St all the way to Cleveland Circle.  We can walk around Fenway Park if people want to.  Straight down Beacon St is just shy of 3 miles, and takes about an hour.  If that's not enough we can walk back towards Boston along Comm Ave.  It'll be up to the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to walk more, less, or have ideas let me know.  I'm also open to dinner after the walk too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked 6:30 so we'll get a tiny bit more daylight (sunset is at 6:44pm).  If that's too early let me know and I'll move it to 7 or later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=====&lt;br /&gt;As for other walks, I want to do some that explore less T accessible parts of the city but starting at a T stop and walking away from them.  Some of my ideas are walking through JP, the South End, Beacon Hill, maybe somewhere out on the Blue Line, etc.  If you have places you'd like to go, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Green coat, blue jeans.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236897339000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235952908000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beacon St through Boston, Brookline, and Brighton</name><id>9854968</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236724200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9854968/</event_url></item>
