By request, we will be reading Dreams of Trespass by Fatima Mernissi for our October book discussion. Here is a brief description..."I was born in a harem in 1940 in Fez, Morocco..." So begins Fatima Mernissi in this exotic and rich narrative of a childhood behind the iron gates of a domestic harem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, on another note, my role as coordinator of the book club ends in December. I know it seems like forever from now, but if you are interested in coordinating the book club for 2013, please let me know. All you have to do is choose a book each month (many of these are suggested by our group) and schedule the monthly meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the book!&lt;/p&gt;
