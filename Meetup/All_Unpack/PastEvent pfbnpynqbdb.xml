Pop, folk, Broadway tunes? Then try live piano karaoke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring along lyric sheets (or an excellent memory of the lyrics) of your favorite classic, well-known songs and we'll play them in your best key. We can also use our laptop and WiFi connection to pull down the lyrics from the internet, right on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have a microphone set up --- you can sing with the mic, or without. You can sing solo, do a duet with a friend, or lead the crowd in a sing-along of a well-known tune --- your call. It's edgy, it's in-the-moment, it's fun!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've got questions about a tune you'd like to choose, please call Elise at 603-562-5179 or email her at studio99nashua@gmail.com. But feel free to just surprise us --- as long as it's a well-known tune, chances are it'll be a great choice! We also have a lot of sheet music songbooks you can review; even if we don't know a song well, we can read it from the sheet music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee, tea, chilled soft drinks and waters, snacks and chocolates are available for purchase. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask; there shouldn't be that big a crowd.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>NeilL</member_name><member_id>3034835</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291411914000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285269375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live Piano Karaoke</name><id>pfbnpynqbdb</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291334400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/15434636/</event_url></item>
