&lt;p&gt;This is a repeat of our famous Boston's Homeless Assistance meetup. We have a few special requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been asked for 1) soap (bars of soap), 2) a pair of size 13 sneakers for Rob, 3) a pair of size 12 sneakers for John, 4) a pair of lady's extra large sweat pants and size 7 lady's sneakers (Ali, you know that person...). Socks and underwear are also always big winners, both women and men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, they appreciate any kind of treats, donuts are popular (of course) and also boxes of Joe's... I am sure they would appreciate that something special you like, since they don't get too many treats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frederick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was such a success that I want to repeat this every other week! We've helped a lot of people on that day, and I know we can do it again. Nights are still cool and people do appreciate the apparels we gave them. Be it new underwear, socks, t-shirts, or something warmer, all was appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Nagina, we also had a number of lunches to share with anyone who was hungry. I will definitely bring some myself on the 13th, and I encourage anyone of you who would like to do the same to just do so. A sandwich, a fruit, a snack (chips, chocolate) and a beverage (juice box or other) made a lot of people happy on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to start taking orders... As we get to know them better, and identify 'the regulars', I'd like to ask them specifically what they need, and see what we can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one special order for next time, a fellow named 'George Washington' (he insisted to show me his ID) needs a pair of shoes (size 12) and a pair of black pants (40 waist, 32 long), if anyone can find this, that would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we will wait about 15 minutes at the city place and will depart at noon shortly. If we have already left when you get there, don't hesitate to call me (781-308-4595).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Across from the movie theater on the commons</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>frederick</member_name><member_id>25269862</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367294429000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Volunteers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BigEnoughtoDeliver</urlname><id>1343564</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Volunteers.
