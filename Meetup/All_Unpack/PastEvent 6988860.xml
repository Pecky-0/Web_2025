Quincy Station&lt;br /&gt;3) When exiting the train, turn right, walk through the metal/glass doors, and through the ticket gates.&lt;br /&gt;4) Turn left and walk out the exit doors&lt;br /&gt;5) Turn right, and walk toward the road (West Squantum St).&lt;br /&gt;6) Cross the Street onto Holmes St (there's a crosswalk, but BE CAREFUL of traffic!!!).&lt;br /&gt;7) Take a left on Moscow St (I like to think that everyone's a communist on that street).&lt;br /&gt;8) Take a slight right onto Hancock Street.  You will have a 711 right next to you.&lt;br /&gt;9) At the yellow blinking light, cross the street onto Glover Ave.&lt;br /&gt;10) Take a right onto Felton St.&lt;br /&gt;11) Enter our apartment on the right, and provide your hosts with expensive gifts (everyone always ignores this step! :P).
