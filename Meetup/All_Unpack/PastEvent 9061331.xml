There also happens to be an excellent ridge-side trail leading up to it.  West Peak sports excellent views, nice terrain, and good continued vistas as you head north along the trap rock ridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail head is at Hubbard Park in Meriden, CT.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-91 to I-691W in Meriden&lt;br /&gt;* Get off on exit 4 and take a left off of the exit (CT-322)&lt;br /&gt;* Take the first left (Mirror Lake Dr) into Hubbard Park&lt;br /&gt;* Go around the far side of the pond until you find the large parking lot.  This is where we will meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.live.com/OneClickDirections.aspx?mkt=en-us&amp;amp;rtp=~pos.qxrffm8xxm74&amp;amp;FORM=LLMP" target="_blank"&gt;1-Click directions through Live Search Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HIKE:&lt;br /&gt;This hike gets in your face from the start.  A steep incline not far from the trailhead leads us to a pavillion standing in the woods.  The rest of it is reasonably flat, and half with views. The trail gets in your face after a while again, as we begin our ascent to the summit of West Peak, but it doesn't stay there for very long.  The trail skirts the very edge of the mountain, though there are trees on the down side.  At the top of this steep incline is a talus ravine with a number of medium sized boulders at the top, open to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this point, it is only a short distance to West Peak.  Walking along, you enter deep foliage with earth rising up along both sides of you, and the trail veers to the left and switches back, and up.  You'll come to a T intersection, joining a well-worn path.  The primary vista of West Peak is to your left.  Mount Carmel (the Sleeping Giant) lies immediately south of here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail heads north into the forest, along trap-rock ridges.  There are a number of vistas up here.  After continuing on a ways, it is prudent to switch back.  The trail essentially terminates once you hit the power lines, and a honeycomb of ATV trails permeate the forest to the east.  You can find your way back to West Peak by taking them, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once back at West Peak, it's an easy affair to find your way over to East Peak and Castle Craig.  This is a large stone tower built in the early 1900s.  Both Castle Craig and West Peak have access roads coming in from Hubbard Park, so this area is often populated by people driving in.  There is, however, another trail leading down the mountain and directly into the Hubbard Park parking area from here.  At the top of this trail (incidentally) there is also a branch leading strait along the ridge line above Merimere Reservoir, which connects to &amp;quot;Reservoir Ave&amp;quot;, the paved access road to the peaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURATION:&lt;br /&gt;The hike should take approximately 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT INFO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/4429379/"&gt;Adam Skinner&lt;/a&gt; is leading this hike.
