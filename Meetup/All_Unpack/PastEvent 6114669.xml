How about 10:am???  I will try to call the parks dept to make sure that there is not a baseball team there.  If there is one, then we will change the meetup place to Amory and I will let everyone know.  Please note the Brookline AVe Park is right on Brookline Ave.  Amory is at Amory and Thatcher Street.  For some reason the last email had them mixed up!&lt;br /&gt;Faith&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Faith Michaels</member_name><member_id>3286626</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188309844000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>JRT OWNERS</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-61</urlname><id>339624</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Jack Russell Terrier Boston Area Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186065205000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>JACK RUSSELL GET TOGETHER-address change</name><id>6114669</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188136800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-61/events/6114669/</event_url></item>
