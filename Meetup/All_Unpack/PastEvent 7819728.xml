We will car pool in Farmington/Simsbury/Avon and also in West Hartford. People in the Colchester/Glastonbury area may want to create another car pool. When you RSVP please give me the location where you'd like to car pool or indicate that you're driving on your own. We will meet at 1 pm at the ticket counter, and late comers should find us in the exhibit. The cost is $7 per person but if we have enough RSVPs we will try for a group rate of $3 per person, so RSVP soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmen (un miembro de Spanish Meetup) escribe: La exposicion es en el Peabody Museum en New Haven va a estar del 22 de marzo al 22 de Julio yo creo que vale mucho la pena tiene desde arte precolombino hasta arte del siglo XX, te da un panorama del arte y la cultura mexicana.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions?

Developed by the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Las Artes de México examines over 3,500 years of art and culture and of tradition and change across the broad spectrum of Mexican life, from the ancient worlds of the Mayans and Aztecs to the 20th century works of Miguel Covarrubias and Diego Rivera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are artifacts from over a dozen pre-Columbian cultures that reveal a world of ceremony and celebration, of ritual warfare and the veneration of the dead, along with a selection of material from the Peabody?s own collections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving forward in time, folk portraits and carvings of patron saints eloquently show the merging of Spanish culture, Catholic iconography, and native art after the founding of New Spain in the 1500s, while colorful costumes and glittering fabrics illustrate folk celebrations and other traditional practices that continued through the colonial period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social commentary became a hallmark of Mexican art, and this exhibition examines both paintings and works on paper during the development of the modern Mexican state.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the ticket counter at 1 pm.
