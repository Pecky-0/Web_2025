&lt;p&gt;Yours truly turns 29 this Thursday right after incubator start time at 7:51pm and it gives me no greater pleasure than to celebrate with all of you and to also celebrate each one of you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Improv Incubator has been laughing out loud on Thursdays for the last 6 plus years (with many thanks and kudos to founder Barbara Kremen) and along the way it has been a pleasure to share laughter with you all, to grow not only as improvisers, but also as to grow as people.  Here's to everyone, to those that have come once or have come often to shed off the week with some fun games and to have given yourself the gift of acting silly in what can be at times a too serious world.  I thank you all for stepping outside the box, taking chances, and throwing yourself into the games and fun that my co-organizers and I have tossed your way over the past 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that on Thursday, I will host a come one come all incubator in my backyard so please come on by even if its for the first time.  Bring friends too!  This incubator will be a potluck too so please bring any food you'd like to share, could be big, could be small, also could be nothing at all not a requirement to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And further by request, we are making this a costume Incubator!!  a first in incubator history I think.  The weather suppose to be gorgeous that night so deck yourself out in something strange.   Could be fancy, could be fun, be creative and we'll come up with some scenes for your characters and your costumes to be in together.  And I'll do my best to take out whatever costumes or accessories i have lying around.  Again don't be obliged to come in costume but if you can, do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So things will kick off at 7:30 in my backyard Thursday.  I can't wait to see all of you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace, laughter, and basic human goodness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those that are still interested in yoga, i will send out another email shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do yoga before incubator this week meeting in my backyard and doing it there or heading over to a local park. I have plenty of extra mats so please anyone who is in the slightest interested please come by. The class will be donation based from 6:30-7:30pm. Recommended donation is $5-$15. But please come regardless of whether or not you can make a donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
