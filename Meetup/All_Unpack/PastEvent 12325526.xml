Hump DAY, WOW (for you old-school AAF fans), miercoles, quarta-feira, Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll try to wear something exciting, like my red yoga pants and red-and-white-striped tank top (well, they ARE the MeetUp.com colors!). If it is cold, I'll likely also have on a navy zip-up hoodie. But look for the red pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at the picnic tables by 7 PM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll team up by 7:15 PM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you arrive late, check the dry-erase board, where I'll post what I'm wearing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and now for the usual stuff... &lt;br /&gt;Please note: you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. Ladies get a 50% discount on Monday nights! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;. for directions. You'll NEED them if this is your first time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check my Profile Picture to identify me.
