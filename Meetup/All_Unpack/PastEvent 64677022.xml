&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Charles will begin the evening with an introductory talk demystifying the ancient art of Tantra. It will be followed by an experiential exercise called the Puja. The Puja is a transformative ritual designed to heal, awaken, and open the energy system especially the heart chakra. In the Puja you will stand in a circle with other participants and engage in meditation techniques guided by Charles. Alongside gaining a better understanding of Tantric principles and practices, you will get a taste of the possibilities of deep intimacy and passion such spiritual approach to sexual love brings. Singles, meet in a romantic and conscious setting with others. Couples, deepen trust and enhance intimacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRE-REQUISITES: There is no pre-requisite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE TRADITION / STYLE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tantra yoga is an ancient spiritual system in which sexual love is considered a sacrament and the body a temple of the spirit. Of hundreds of yogic paths, it is the only one that gives an alternative to celibacy. It is a path where one is in an extended meditation wherein the entire body becomes an instrument of love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The essence of tantric practice is not only better sex, it is union. It increases intimacy and connection while honoring the divinity in each of us, awakening and releasing female and male sexual energy to move through you, and not out of you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
