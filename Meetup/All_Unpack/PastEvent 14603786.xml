In the eyes of many, Gilbert was a woman who had it all -- a loving husband, a great apartment, and a weekend home -- but sometimes one realizes too little too late that they haven't gotten what they truly wanted from life. On the heels of a painful divorce, the woman who had previously looked forward to a contented life of domesticated bliss sets out to explore the world and seek out her true destiny. Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner produce a film starring Julia Roberts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Julia Roberts, James Franco, Javier Bardem, Richard Jenkins, Billy Crudup &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: Ryan Murphy &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby by the restaurant.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283486128000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283266439000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eat Pray Love</name><id>14603786</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283381100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/14603786/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/8/1/global_17620993.jpeg</photo_url></item>
