If you happen to come after we already hit the walls, just try to find me. Look out for curly hair and an interesting sounding accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: you will have to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. Ladies get a discount on Monday nights!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Monday night belay classes are filling up quickly, so sign up early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/e-directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt; for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to join us at TGIFs after climbing for drinks and food.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Picnic table in the gym, 7 PM</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>8472361</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250723670000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248792520000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mondays @ Metrorock</name><id>10976320</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250550000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/10976320/</event_url></item>
