&lt;p&gt;Stephen Siller Tunnel To Towers Run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 11, 2001, a Brooklyn-based off duty firefighter and father of five heard the call to action. When his truck was prohibited from entering the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, he raced on foot towards the site with his gear strapped to his back. This effort is dedicated in the memory, and in honor, of all who serve our communities and nation with the courage and commitment exemplified by Stephen Siller.&lt;/p&gt;
