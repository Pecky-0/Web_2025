<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Sorry guys, change in venue!  Now we'll be doing karaoke at The Wave in Waltham so we can stick to the date and get out on a Friday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news though - free pool at The Wave from 5-7PM, then karaoke starts at 9ish.  We've done this place before and it's a really low-key kinda place... not necessarily a beer haven, but a very fun place to get together on a Friday night.  It can be a little bit hard to find on the first trip, so check out the directions here: &lt;a href="http://www.wavesportspub.com/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wavesportspub.com/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wavesports...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wave's crowd is usually young and energetic and there is rarely a wait to sing karaoke! Huzzah!  They also do pitchers which is a great way to get more bang for your buck in the drink vs. expense department... and it's our local stomping grounds.  Why not? :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me. 413-695-2121.
