You will need to bring double boots, crampons, harness, and helmet, warm clothes, food and snack. If you have other ice climbing gear (ropes, axes, etc), please bring it along. Some climbing experience best, but not required. You can rent some of the gear at IME North Conway or REI Reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at Annie's Diner in Plymouth, NH, which is at N43.760192, W71.683892. From there, we will car pool to the climb site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This meetup is scheduled for Saturday, but may go on Sunday Jan 9 if the weather is better and OK with the majority of people signed up. Please let everyone know if your schedule allows for either day, or only on a specific day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken D&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken Domino</member_name><member_id>4332297</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294686229000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292715727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ice climbing</name><id>15768945</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294576200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/15768945/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/d/global_19117277.jpeg</photo_url></item>
