 This is your opportunity to sell your old skis, boots or snowboards and buy new or used equipment! The ski swap draws a huge crowd and is well worth attending. Not only do we have people's equipment for sale, but Punam's Ski &amp;amp; Snowboard Shop and another ski shop bring in previous year's equipment for sale at great deals. &lt;br /&gt;

 If you are selling, used equipment is being accepted at Putnam's, 2998 Lafayette Road, (Rt 1), Portsmouth on one of the following dates: &lt;br /&gt;

 Thursday and Friday, November 1 &amp;amp; 2 between 5:30 - 8:30 pm &lt;br /&gt;
