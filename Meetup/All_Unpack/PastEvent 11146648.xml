They just started serving breakfast so, this will be my first time. They are well known for great food and they have a bakery! I have a coupon for the bakery too.  Get yourselves out on a Sunday morning and come on over  to The Wayside Inn and sit and hang out with us for breakfast. See you there. This meet-up is booked on 3 sites. For those of you who are on all 3 sites please book on all of them or else......thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet outside if weather permitting.
