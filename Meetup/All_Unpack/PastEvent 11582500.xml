I am sorry if that inconveniences anyone...  O'Connor's has also asked me to find out how many think they will be eating dinner or just having a few drinks.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet other Worcester area atheists at the first of our many events! Members of Greater Worcester Humanists may have different belief sets, but many of us are atheists.  We want to meet more of you!  The purpose of these Meetups is to meet new people and socialize with like minded individuals in a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere.  So come join us - have dinner or dessert, have a drink (or two), and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP before the 27th so we can firm up out reservations!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>ask for the Worcester Humanists group or for the large party with Chris</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce</member_name><member_id>4296523</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1257119589000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255030056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Atheists Meetup @ O'Connor's</name><id>11582500</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256946300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/11582500/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/2/global_7423922.jpeg</photo_url></item>
