An opportunity to have a new look on the Mystics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saint John of the Cross was a Spanish Mystic from the 16th century. St John and Ste Theresa of Avila contributed to the reformation of the Carmelite Order. They both placed their relationship with God first, defying the norms, rules and religious authority of their time. St John of the Cross is a living example of someone who pursued the deepest desire of his soul: being in union with God. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic opportunity to get together , share about the movie &amp;amp; meet great people. I hope to see you all there.. And yes, popcorn will be served! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173054743000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170465020000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!
