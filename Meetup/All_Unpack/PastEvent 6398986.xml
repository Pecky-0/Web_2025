Nearly two hundred people, most of William's friends, were in the restaurant on the morning of September 11. None of them survived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly twenty years, the Puerto Rican-born, New Jersey resident was a custodian in-charge of the three stairwells ? A, B and C ? in the North Tower. In possession of the master key that opened all of the stairwell doors at each floor in the 110 story building, William Rodriguez personally saved the lives of 15 people that day and aided NYC firefighters in saving hundreds of others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having told his chilling account to thousands of people across the globe, he comes to Boston sharing his stories of heroic and selfless first responders, his personal witness to explosions in the sub-basements before the plane hit the North Tower and during the rescue efforts, and tales of strange noises coming from the vacant and restricted 34th floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honored five times by President Bush, William Rodriguez has helped draft and implement legislation on behalf of members, in demanding the creation of the 9/11 Commission, during which his testimony was kept private and mysteriously excluded from its final report. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Rodriguez has electrified audiences in Europe, Asia, and South America, and his uncompromising candor and heroism promises to be a night you will never forget. Join fellow Bostonians in giving him a true hero's welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;An Evening with William Rodriguez&amp;quot; will take place at 7:00 pm on Thursday, May 17 at the International Community Church, 557 Cambridge Street in Allston. Parking is available at the school next to the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His visit is part of his ongoing &amp;quot;9/11 Keymaster Tour,&amp;quot; which continues Friday, May 18th 6:30 pm at Franklin Pierce College, Pierce Hall in Rindge, NH, and Saturday May 19, 2 pm at the First Congregational Church of Lee, 25 Park Place, Lee, MA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Transportation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Green Line (B-Train, Boston College line) outbound to the Warren Street stop.
