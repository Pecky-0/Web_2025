We've been so busy that we have not had a chance to go in quite a while.  It is best with a great group of people.  The BEST place to go for dim sum is Chau Chow City on Essex St.  I grew up having tea there on Sundays and know some of the people who work there, so I know we will have the best service.  I know this is short notice, but I thought that people might still be able to make it if they would like to try some REAL Chinses food and have someone there who knows what and how to order.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the tables are round so that we can see and talk to each other without having to feel like we are interrupting anyone's conversation.  Everything is family style, so everyone can try everything.  Afterwards, the people who are up for it can come with Jay and me to shop in Chinatown for groceries and other yummies.  Note:  Most of Chinatown is cash only, so please bring cash with you for this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there for this authentic Chinese experience.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go right upstair when you walk into the Chau Chow.
