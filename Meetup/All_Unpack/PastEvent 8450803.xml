Its great for us city dwellers to get the opportunity to enjoy so much open space and fresh air. So we'll be at the park on most Wednesdays. I hate to get into a rut but this place is convenient and not too far to travel for us. I think it'll be a great mid week treat for us and the rest of the pack. So look for this Meetup to happen almost weekly. As always its a joy getting to meet everyone. If you don't see us waiting in the parking lot, then were up in the fields playing fetch. As always bring poop bags, toys ( if you want) and water ( for yourself and you dog)  WOOF WOOF.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I drive a Chevy Tracker with a "WOOF" sticker on back</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jennifer</member_name><member_id>4251176</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4894798</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218839636000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217544339000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Romp in the Park</name><id>8450803</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218666600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/8450803/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/b/global_5058667.jpeg</photo_url></item>
