They're at Ryles on the 26th, so let's Meetup for a night of great music and dancing. Several other meetup groups will also be attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not familiar with No Static? You can check out a few of their Steely Dan covers on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show starts at 9:00 and tickets are $12 at the door. Tickets are now available online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to get tickets in advance as they WILL SELL OUT! I have some tickets together so you can contact me if interested otherwise you can buy tickets at: &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://ryles.interticket.com/arrivalorder.php?eid=2723&amp;amp;aid=4&amp;amp;vid=4"&gt;http://ryles.interticket.com/arrivalorder.php?eid=2723&amp;amp;aid=4&amp;amp;vid=4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryles also serves dinner. You can see their menu online if you're interested in dinner &amp;amp; a show. (The Mitch's Barbecue is quite good.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can park in the S&amp;amp;S Deli parking lots as both S&amp;amp;S and Ryles are owned by the same family. The lot entrance is on Hampshire Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a small municipal lot on Springfield St. See this map. You should be able to see the lot on Springfield as well as the S&amp;amp;S between Hampshire and Cambridge streets. Please check the signs in this lot as I don't remember how late the meters are active (although most of Cambridge is now 8 p.m.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are also metered street spaces in the area, but you'll need to be persistent and patient to nab them. Allow extra time to find a parking space if you're arriving later as you will definitely end up hunting. Again, check signs and the meters; I think these are also active until 8 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty easy to pick out in a crowd as I am 6' tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367032155000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366853706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>No Static returns to Ryles</name><id>116061702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367020800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/116061702/</event_url></item>
