 James Gage will present the talk on The History of American Root Cellars For most people, the term "root cellar" evokes an image of a brick or stone masonry subterranean structure tunneled into a hillside. These classic root cellars are only one of a number of different types of structures used to preserve root crops, vegetables and fruits over the past 400 years. The other structures include subfloor pits, cooling pits, house cellars, barn cellars, and field root pits. This lecture explores the origins, history, and design of root cellars. The presentation will be accompanied by photos of surviving examples of root cellars from the New England region as well as period illustrations from across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration is required as space is limited. &lt;br /&gt;
