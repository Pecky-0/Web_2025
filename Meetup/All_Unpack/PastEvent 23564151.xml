&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;2011 marks the 20th anniversary season of the Newport International Polo Series. All the stops have been pulled out to celebrate this milestone fittingly, with an all-star lineup of international competitors including the debuts of Kenya and Brazil, a City Series featuring US rivals and many festive events coordinated for fun on and off the field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The match starts at 4pm. &amp;nbsp; Gates open at noon. &amp;nbsp;Its full tailgating, so small grills, your own food and beverages are all allowed - if not encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $30 tailgating spot has been reserved, so a few bucks from each for that would be appreciated. &amp;nbsp; The tailgating spot does NOT include individual tickets which is $10 per person at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a joint meetup with Massachusetts' "South Shore Hike, Bike, and Social" Group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will give out my cell number to 'yes' RSVPs.
