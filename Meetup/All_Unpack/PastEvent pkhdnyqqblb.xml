We have a large, outdoor, fenced-in play yard and a large, indoor play room as well. Your dog may run around, off leash, in a safe environment with no worries! All breeds and sizes are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know prior to the 9th and we can schedule an appointment with a 25% off discount. If you have any questions give me a call or send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355000784000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354475573000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>pkhdnyqqblb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354989600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/93755792/</event_url></item>
