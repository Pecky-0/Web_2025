<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome to join us on Saturday, 2PM @ Cambridge Common for flag-football. We welcome all players, regardless of skill level. We want to have fun, and we want you to have fun as well. There are a group of regulars that have a great time every week, and we're always looking for fresh faces. Whether you would like to get out to play flag-football, just want to exercise, or want to meet new people - this is a great opportunity. Weather conditions are not regarded on Saturdays. We will play - rain or shine, snow or wind. I'm excited for this Saturday, and I hope to see you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cambrdige Flag-Footballer&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197346640000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196743041000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football - Sat - 2PM - Cambridge Common</name><id>6852119</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197140400000</time><rsvp_limit>26</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6852119/</event_url></item>
