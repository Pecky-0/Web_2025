<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Mt. Holyoke Range State Park is a little North of Springfield with 3,000 acres! The exact length and path covered on this hike will depend on the weather conditions. If there is little or no snow ***we'll do a traditional hike.*** If there is something like 6 inches or more of snow we will either hike, try snowshoeing, or maybe even cross country skiing. We'll hike no more than approximatly 6 miles with less being the case if conditions require more effort given a 4 hour window for hiking. Most of the hike would be light to low moderate in difficulty with some limited opportunity for high-moderate exertion. Streams, forest, and quiet solitude will dominate the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm hiking shoes or boots are required (no sneakers) as there can be snow and wet muddy conditions in places. Dress in layers to be warm when still and cool when active (i.e. remove layers). Please bring some water for yourself too. A daypack or bookbag would be advised to carry your water and to stow a jacket as you warm up on the hike. It is not advised to wear cotton based clothing but wool or synthetics instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 10 AM at the Notch Visitors Center at the west side of the park (see the park map). Directions are below. We'll likely relocate to another parking location for the hike (south or north side of the park). We will hike (with rest stops and sightseeing) about 4 hr. and get back to the vehicles at about 2 PM. Then the plan is to head out to eat a late lunch together back down MA-116 in South Hadley. There are plenty of good places to eat in one place near Holyoke College. We would finish up eating at about 3:30 PM and head home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S can provide carpooling for up to 6 from the Wal-Mart in E. Windsor ***leaving*** at a 9 AM for those interested. There will be a blue Dodge Grandcaravan Sport. Please chip in for gas and the drive is an hour. Return at about 4:30 PM. It is advised to call Kevin (number in RSVP) so he knows you plan to carpool. Directions for the carpool meet-up can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;searchtab=home&amp;amp;formtype=address&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=69+Prospect+Hill+rd.&amp;amp;city=East+Windsor&amp;amp;state=CT" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General park information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/hksp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/Holyoke.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location to meet at park (can get directions from here):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=1540+West+St.&amp;amp;city=Amherst&amp;amp;state=MA" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this event is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1167664107000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166581058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Mt.
