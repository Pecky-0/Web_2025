THE EARLIEST THEY CAN ACCEPT A RESERVATION IS 7:45 PM. IF YOU DO NOT SAY THAT YOU WILL COME FOR DINNER IT IS ASSUMED YOU WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE RESERVATION. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like funky music and dancing all night long (and we do!), don't miss this get-together. Several folks in the meet-up have been to Johnny D's to see this band and had a lot of fun. &lt;br /&gt;www.miloz.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will reserve a table for dinner - Johnny D's has good, cheap food. NOTE - There is a cover fee at the door, usually $10.  RSVP YES or NO for dinner reservations at 7:30. Band at 9:45&lt;br /&gt;Parking in Davis Square on a Sat. night is not easy - Check Johnny D's website for parking recommendations: (&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.johnnyds.c...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;Also can take the Red Line in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is being planned by two of our members Barbara and Linda...thanks ladies, sounds like a good time. Nice to offer an event in another area. :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195523960000</updated><rating><average>4.36000013351</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
