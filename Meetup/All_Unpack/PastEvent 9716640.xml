According to their website, the Sunday program usually runs as follows: Welcome; Opening Words; Musical Selection; Speaker's presentation; Music; Announcements; Closing Words; Refreshment Break; and Question &amp;amp; answer with the Speaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 22nd, the speaker topic is &amp;quot;Nuclear Testing: Finishing the Work of Women Strike for Peace.&amp;quot; The speaker will be Eva Mosely, who in the early 1960's campaigned with Women Strike for Peace for a nuclear test ban. President John Kennedy signed a treaty for a partial ban in 1963. Will President Obama get a comprehensive test ban signed and ratified?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program should end at 12:30 P.M., at which time we'll seek out a Cambridge location for brunch.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235658853000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234313037000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Visit to Ethical Society of Boston</name><id>9716640</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235316600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/9716640/</event_url></item>
