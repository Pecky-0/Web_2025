I will be performing my original songs at 7PM. There is no cover charge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emerald Rose has specialty drinks including the Fruit Salad drink and every beer you can imagine. &lt;br /&gt;They also have everything ranging from Irish dishes to American dishes including seafood. Their reviews are great and the atmosphere hospitable.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play pop, rock and alternative originals and I write most of my songs. My music is about having a positive outlook on life. This show I will be performing an acoustic set so for those who haven't seen me, I will be taking a different slant on things. I try to write with the intent of helping people from all walks of life get past their fears and accomplish satisfaction in their lives. If I can reach people through my music, I believe I am helping my fans one by one.
