Guess what! One of gazillion pairs of naked feet all over the globe could use just those pair(s) of shoes you have lying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’d like to donate shoes, how about we use that as an excuse for some REAL good coffee and yakety yak at Simon’s, my favorite café in Cambridge/Boston, for some divine espresso! Then we could head over to the nearest Timberland store in Cambridge (close to the CambridgeSide Galleria) to drop off shoes for the Soles4Soul program that the store participates in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon’s is located minutes (by walk) from either the Porter Square or Harvard Square T-stations. Unfortunately, the café doesn’t have a website but we doubt you will be terribly disappointed after this Cup O’ Joe experiment. I think &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/simons-coffee-shop-cambridge" target="_blank"&gt;Simon’s&lt;/a&gt; espresso drinks rock. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know what will happen to your shoes once you donate them, read &lt;a href="http://www.soles4souls.org/donate/your_shoes.html" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***AND... If you just want to hang out for coffee, that would be cool. Just come along and enjoy a great cup of coffee, espresso, hot chocolate or what have you.***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rajjo</member_name><member_id>8334158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263244313000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259858537000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Got Shoes?
