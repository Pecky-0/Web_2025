&lt;p&gt;As the weather warms up, the Meetups will be scheduled to an earlier time (eventually to 8:30 AM). However, since it's still fairly cold, hopefully with the later start time, the sun has warmed up the day a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend Meetups are informal and unstructured - show up and play with whoever else shows up. Open to all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please contact Susan (Asst Organizer) if you are interested in becoming a regular Meetup host. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366478169000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364767268000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sat AM @ Dugger</name><id>dlpmrfyrgbbc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366466400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/111994472/</event_url></item>
