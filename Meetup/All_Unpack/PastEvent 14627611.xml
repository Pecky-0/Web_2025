If they are lucky they will be able to read cards for their friends or families, but most often they are left more confused than when they went in. The trend of selling people long stretched out courses which teach people to use their own intuitive gifts is not one that is followed by me! &lt;br /&gt;This class is only a 3 hour time commitment and by the time you are done, you will be able to give readings! You need only an open mind and heart to be able to read for yourself and others. I have taught beginners and professional readers alike and all have walked away with the ability to not only read the cards but to create their own spreads and individualize them for any kind of question! All ages are welcome in this class and some of the students who have attended this course started working as psychics almost immediately. I have had a resounding success rate with child psychics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a notebook and a pen. You may bring your own deck or use one of ours. I essentially teach out of the Sonia Choquette deck. However, there will be various decks for you to look at and practice with. My suggestion is to not buy a deck in advance. Do the course and then decide which one you would like go with. Come and see how simple it can be! I am a psychic medium. I specialize in card and flower readings and is available for parties and events.

Concrete lesson with emphasis on trusting your own intuition. I feel I could give readings anywhere now. Thanks JD!‚Äù &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee-&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This was a very practical workshop. Jenn teaches you how to do parties and professional readings from the start. My 11 year old daughter attended and it was perfect for her as well.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark-&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;I had been having issues using my oracle deck until I took this class. It was like she gave me the missing key that I needed. I suggest that if you want to work with Oracle cards to do readings for you or someone else, that you sign up for the next class that she is going to.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suzanne-&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What a delight JD is ! She was bright, engaging, warm, and informed. It was a blessing to be in the class. We all learned a lot, were relaxed, and enjoyed our time together. Time well spent.... many thanks&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pam- &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Phenomenal. I learned so much I was practicing on myself all night!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q-  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;OMG! Just the class I needed to give me the final push to start doing this. I am so glad I took this course. Thank you J.D!&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste Oliver-&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Jen explained the different sets of cards and the situations they're good for - something I hadn't thought of before. And I gained the confidence to go ahead with my cards and give readings as an adjunct to my psychic/medium readings. Thanks Jen!&amp;quot;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee Van Zyl-&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I had a reading with one of the attendees and she had a lot of good accurate hits. Its amazing what one can accomplish in 3 hours.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tashia Hilliard-&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I was a skeptic about the cards but I learned that your intuition guides you during a tarot card reading.Jen was an excellent instructor.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Readings By JD</member_name><member_id>9397498</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288729956000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gifted</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Friends-in-Spirit</urlname><id>1373252</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Friends in Spirit</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283394565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn to read tarot and oracle cards-Without the schlep of studying!</name><id>14627611</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288645200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Friends-in-Spirit/events/14627611/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/4/global_7183796.jpeg</photo_url></item>
