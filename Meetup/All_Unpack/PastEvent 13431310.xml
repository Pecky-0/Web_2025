It's a favorite of many P-Collective members, and the bar has awesome art deco-inspired carved panels. By P-Member request we are returning to this special favorite designed by the same artist as Louie Fullers and Ama's! They don't serve food, so make sure you stop for a snack before heading over. If you haven't been yet, then its worth checking out and if you've already been.....well....yey! - we're going to the Avery! So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Avery is kind of on a corner intersection where Vinton St. dead ends into the intersection of Carpenter and W. Fountain streets. Vinton St. is off Broadway on the West Side of Providence. Click on the link for the Avery above and Google has a decent map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Its one large space and somewhat dark, but you can't miss us!
