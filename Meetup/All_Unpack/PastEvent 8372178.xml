Through the power of a single intention, that of healing, the group will conduct hands-on healing on individuals seeking relief, healing, or improvement in any area of their health or life. We will channel the power of many hearts and many minds into one laser beam of focused thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mint will be teaching about taking the pulse as a diagnostic tool by which one can measure the effectiveness and suitability of healing techniques for an individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have a moment of meditation and do some very basic work with the breath. Proper breathing is vital to one's capacity to connect with the source of healing and consciously direct and work with energy. (Note: &lt;b&gt;No shoes in the meeting space&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimum # of participants needed: 10 &lt;br /&gt;Ideal # of participants: 15-20&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Rear entrance - up the stairs.
