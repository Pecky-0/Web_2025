We all thought it was a great location last time, so we'll keep it there, but we will change the time slightly.  We are now meeting at 2pm instead of 1pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Please be ON TIME...it is very difficult to add in a player who is late.  The game starts at 2pm sharp.  You may want to arrive a bit early if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Bring your calculators&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Bring your favorite pencils and erasers (if you have them).  We do provide pencils and erasers, but some people are just picky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of metered parking on Huntington Ave, and it's free since it's Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, please keep up your RSVP count.  You guys did such a great job last time, what with the weather and all.  It really does help make things easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Russ&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Enter Dodge and we'll be in one of the classrooms on the LEFT</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234118476000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232067287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January 25 Cashflow Meetup</name><id>9533629</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232910000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/9533629/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
