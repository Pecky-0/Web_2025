Now in his seventies, the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be Here Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; continues to teach and inspire as he deals with a massive stroke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222 ; font-size : small"&gt;Fierce Grace documents Ram Dass remaking his life. While the illness might have broken others, it provided Dass with a new passion: using an unexpected, uninvited challenge as a tool for spiritual transformation, and using what he learns to help others face issues of aging, death and dying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222 ; font-size : small"&gt;Conscious movies at the Centers of Light are an opportunity to connect with others who are looking for ways to positively change the world. These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It’s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that’s truly helping the world. Come see a free showing at your local Center of Light and join in on the discussion to bring peace and consciousness to our world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
