We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time. Hike ratings: easy, moderate, strenuous,very strenuous. There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group).The hiking Meetup group, (Fellowship Of The Tortoise) does easier,slower paced hikes than  this group.  Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals. This is a dog free hiking group.&lt;/p&gt;
