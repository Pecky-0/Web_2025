Longest runway is 4000 ft. The Right Fork restaurant is awaiting our orders. Eat inside or out. Keep an eye open for whales in that vicinity. Sometimes they are between 1B2 and ACK. I'll be posting more Sunday Morning Sorties..... &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hsl-Edgartown_Airfield.jpg" class="linkified"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hsl-Edgartown_Airfield.jpg&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Martha's Vineyard functioned both as an outer defense and a training facility for gunnery and pilots. In addition to the main Martha's Vineyard Airport (MVY), there was a small airport at Katama near a gunnery practice area at the beach. Following World War II this airport was purchased by Steven Gentle who ran the Katama Airpark until the 1980s when it was purchased with state conservation funds (as this airfield has five endangered plant or animal species) and is currently managed by the municipal government of Edgartown. It is the quintessential grass airfield - no fancy navigation equipment. It is unique because it is possible to fly a small plane to the airport, taxi from the runway to a parking area 100 feet from the ocean, enjoy the beach during the day, and fly home in the late afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
