<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Going to give this a shot.  If this day is already booked for a bunch of people we can push it back later, or to a different day.  Would like to discuss where people want to go, when is best for you, who knows the area and wants to lead a hike.  Was thinking about posting a sign up for days/places/leaders, and just have people pick a day that works for them to lead so that we don't always rely on one person to pick locations.  Please bring you ideas and your appetites.  I'm going to set this up at Tisane in Hartford, and hopefully it will be warm enough that we can sit outside and chat.  See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking for Tisane is kind of tight sometimes, so be warned.  There's usually plenty on the streets around it if the lot is full.  I'll send out my cell phone number to those going to the meeting a day or so before hand so that if you get lost or can't find us (though the place is pretty small, so that shouldn't be a problem) you can call me.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1141704029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hiking Group Discussion Session</name><id>4869559</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1143388800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4869559/</event_url></item>
