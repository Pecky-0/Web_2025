Snacks will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend that all participants start by consulting the website of the Asperger's Association of New England (www.aane.org), based in Watertown, for suggestions and advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Snacks will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Note that I myself (the organizer) may be able to provide an unusual perspective.  I am a self-diagnosed Aspie who has managed to overcome the disability enough to hold a full-time software engineering job, live alone, and find a girlfriend.  One thing I suggest is use special interests in a way which will benefit you and society as a whole.  Furthermore, never stop learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As a wise old Aspie math geek once wrote in high school, &amp;quot;all these mathematical theories are useless when I try to figure out why I am in love.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's at my apartment.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Goldish</member_name><member_id>3511299</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223592638000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Dealing With Aspergers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>aspergers-354</urlname><id>1034530</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Asperger's Syndrome Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218759200000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Asperger's Syndrome September Meetup</name><id>8547389</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221174000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aspergers-354/events/8547389/</event_url></item>
