Nominated for the 1948 Academy Award for Best Screenplay, and originating from a true story, this self-described “comedy of murders” was based on an idea by Orson Welles, which Chaplin reportedly bought for five thousand dollars in a refusal to be directed by anyone but himself. VERDOUX stars Chaplin as the moustachioed bluebeard in beret and cravat whose charming manners and good looks cloak a deep-seated, murderous hatred, festering since the loss of his longstanding job as a bank clerk.&amp;quot;  -excerpted from Andrea Picard,  Cinematheque Ontario, Brattle website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, on Saturday, August 9 the Brattle will be presenting Fellini's &amp;quot;La Strada&amp;quot;.  Free showing at 11:00 am.  Not sure I can make it, but sounds great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fay&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the front of the theatre after the show</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fay </member_name><member_id>3089505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218575595000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217709199000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monsieur Verdoux</name><id>8463378</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218402000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8463378/</event_url></item>
