Look over what you've got. Pick something short, a flash piece or a scene, that gets you excited or interested, even if you don't know where it's going. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have something, I'll bring a writing exercise to play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring writing implements. Pen &amp;amp; Paper, keyboard, whatever you feel freest with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open Discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lincoln Street Cafe is at the Newton Highlands stop on the Green D Line, or the Lincoln Street stop for the 59 bus. Since it's small, there's an semi-official limit of 8 people. When more than that show up, the group tends to break into smaller groups and keep going. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271779544000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268517973000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers April Meetup</name><id>wtcdnyngbnb</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271534400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/12868992/</event_url></item>
