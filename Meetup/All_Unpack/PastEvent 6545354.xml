Then, journey with Gary McKinstry,Medium, Psychic, Clairvoyant for 2 hours of channeled 'CONNECTIONS' with past lives.  &lt;br /&gt;There are no guarantees of a connection for everyone in the room, however his special ability as the receiver may allow some individuals to achieve a connection with a loved one. At the end of the evening Gary welcomes questions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE* Reservations are needed for this event. IT IS A PRE-PAID EVENT, so you would need to phone the Public House and reserve in order to attend (make sure you check their cancellation policy- THERE ARE NO CANCELLATIONS FOR THIS EVENT) There will be no reserved seating arrangements, although they will make a note that the group will sit together. When you phone, please ask them to add that you will be with &amp;quot;JO/ MEETUP GROUP.&amp;quot; I have posted this event on other meetup group calendars.. it's a weeknight so I am not sure how many will be able to attend.  ALSO, if you are interested in carpooling, please add it to your RSVP along with your location. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HISTORIC PUBLIC HOUSE DINNER  &lt;br /&gt;*Cash Bar &amp;amp; international cheese Display  &lt;br /&gt;*Public House Bakery basket  &lt;br /&gt;*New England Clam Chowder  &lt;br /&gt;*Roast Turkey with Cornbread Sausage Stuffing  &lt;br /&gt;*Fresh Cranberry Sauce  &lt;br /&gt;*Pan Gravy  &lt;br /&gt;*Mashed Potatoes  &lt;br /&gt;*Deep Dish Apple Pies with Vanilla Ice Cream  &lt;br /&gt;Coffee &amp;amp; Tea  &lt;br /&gt;Dinner &amp;amp; Connections event: $49.00 pp  &lt;br /&gt;(tax &amp;amp; gratuity not included)  &lt;br /&gt;Reservations: 508-347-3313&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193526069000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192324334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CONNECTIONS- Gary McKinstry, Psychic, Medium &amp; Clairvoynat</name><id>6545354</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193353200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/6545354/</event_url></item>
