<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;Hi Everyone - Solarfest 2009 is gearing up and it looks better than ever!  I've spoken to the volunteer coordinator and she was really excited to have us Collective peeps back.  If you weren't around for it last year, here's the summary (courtesy of Eric &amp;amp; the solarfest site, with some minor changes from me for this year's pricing &amp;amp; other info)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: sienna"&gt;&amp;quot;ATTENTION CAMPERS and those interested in sustainable living (And those who want to see great performers at a solar-powered venue)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SolarFest blends art, education, and grassroots activism to inspire the conservation of Earth's limited resources, to promote renewable energy, and to support the creation of sustainable communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its inception in 1995, SolarFest has built a strong foundation for promoting artistic excellence and community-building while providing both general and detailed information on a wide range of sustainable living topics . We raise more than a few eyebrows when we explain how our entire weekend festival, including the sound and lights on our main stage, runs on renewable energy , primarily solar with wind and biodiesel in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SolarFest 's reputation as New England's most entertaining energy and music festival is growing just as it should: reasonably and sustainably. We combine superb family entertainment with presentations by some of the region's most knowledgeable renewable energy experts. We thicken the mix with how-to and hands-on workshops on sustainable living, a special children's activity tent, and a wide variety of food, craft, and renewable energy vendors. Our featured performers represent a far-ranging spectrum of styles and traditions from around the world. We provide plenty of space throughout the weekend for serendipitous encounters, conversation, dancing, hiking, camping, relaxation, and an overall celebration of our planet's beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket Prices &lt;br /&gt;Weekend Pass (Friday, Saturday &amp;amp; Sunday: $45&lt;br /&gt;Friday Only: $20 &lt;br /&gt;Saturday only: $30&lt;br /&gt;Sunday only: $25&lt;br /&gt;Vehicle Camping $20 per vehicle for the weekend. &lt;br /&gt;Early bird specials through June 15 - go to solarfest.org to get a reduced ticket pass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volunteers camp and attend the fesitval FOR FREE! If you would like to volunteer for SolarFest 2009, send email to volunteers@solarfest.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camping at this festival is non-technical. Your car is 200 yards (at most) from your campsite and the solar hot water showers are a short walk away. (this is a working farm, so most campsites will be in the pastures on the hill). NO GLASS permitted, so bring your keg cans! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring spending cash ($30-40 above ticket price), bring a great attitude, and most of all, bring sunscreen and a hat! :)  (bring raingear too, just in case!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to see the meetup page from last year's Solarfest, go to &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/calendar/8193799/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you're smart like Kim, you'll remember to bring a notebook and (working) pen to take notes at the many workshops!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;Back to notes from dev:  This event was tremendous last year.  Besides the music, workshops and neat vendors, the community is just amazing.  Really.  It's the kind of place where you could leave your purse, come back an hour later, and it would still be there. (Ok... so I wouldn't recommend testing that theory, but you get the idea – just honest, genuine people.)  And again, while the programming itself is fun, I would highly recommend volunteering.  You get to meet tons of fun people, you get free camping, food and admission – what more could you ask for?  Please register ASAP at solarfest.org if you intend to volunteer to ensure that you get a spot!  Volunteers are asked (if able) to meet at 10am Friday morning.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't arrive until Friday morning, but Eric and others will be there on thursday (info in RSVP).  My volunteer shifts are at the silent aution F: 9am-12pm, Sat: 12pm-3pm and Sunday I will be spending 3 hours at the Silent Auction... but I'm not sure when.  You can find me there, except during the volunteer meeting at 10am on Friday.  Since it is hard to find people (especially if we've never met), Eric did have the good idea of leaving one another messages on the community board.  I will be posting some notebook paper there and checking the board.  Since some people are arriving thurs and others on Fri, to get a more 'collective' feeling going (ha ha) how about we all meet at 6pm Friday evening in front of the solar hot water showers?  I suggest this as it's a small, specific area (rather than 'infront of a tent, stage' etc).  What are people's thoughts?  Please let me know if you plan on meeting me there - I will be there from 6-6:15 and then we can at least meet-and-greet one another formally, and decide what kinds of things we might like to do together.  For the people volunteering, I will see you at 10 on Friday (if you and I don't know one another, but you're volunteering, shoot me an email so that we can set up a more specific/formal meeting place if you'd like).  For your information, I'm 5'2&amp;quot; with long reddish-brown hair and fair skin.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who have posted questions/comments I've responded to you individually or others have posted responses.  If you have further questions, feel free to email me.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring (in addition to a tent, sleeping materials, toiletries etc):&lt;br /&gt;Raingear&lt;br /&gt;Confortable shoes&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;Hat&lt;br /&gt;Bug Spray (if you like)&lt;br /&gt;Water Bottle&lt;br /&gt;Flashlight&lt;br /&gt;Spending Money&lt;br /&gt;Food (though food may be purchased from vendors)&lt;br /&gt;Drinks (again, if you like) - though no glass is allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think those are the basics, but others, feel free to add to this list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t wait for Solarfest!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247759841000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244135303000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Solarfest 2009 July 10th-12th!</name><id>10575902</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247234400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/10575902/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/1/global_8973233.jpeg</photo_url></item>
