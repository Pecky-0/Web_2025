&lt;p&gt;Presented by PetCo, PetSmart and Worceter Animal Rescue League, Pet Rock is the largest animal expo on the East Coast. A daylong festival of fund raising fun for the entire family, including your dog, Pet Rock’s primary purpose is to promote responsible pet ownership, bring attention to animal cruelty and educate humans on a variety of animal related issues. Proceeds benefit New England animal welfare organizations. Pet Rock has given tens of thousands to worthy charities, including the Sterling Animal Shelter, the ASPCA Bird Program, Foster Parrots, Humane Society of the US: Youth, NEADS, the MSPCA, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Mass Vest A Dog, Foster Parrots, Commonwealth Cats, Echo Dog and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet Rock Fest boasts live music, vendors, a food court sponsored by the Boston Vegetarian Society, a “kind kids” booth, animal mascots, games, prizes, raffles, speakers, rides and more than 200 breed rescues, shelters and animal welfare organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our entertainment sponsor is PetSmart, and this year’s headliner is the Pousette-Dart Band, Heather Maloney, along with local bands to be announced. The Pousette-Dart Band, led by Jon Pousette-Dart carved a place in the landscape of American music in the 1970s. They were a mainstay of album radio, a favorite on the college circuit, and became one of the busiest touring groups in the US working with such acts as The Byrds, Bonnie Raitt, Little Feat, The Eagles and James Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are contests rabies clinic, doggie massages, agility course, amateur dog show (with categories such as “owner-dog look alike” and “best vocalist”), New England Frisbee Dog Group, adoptable pet parade with prizes for participating rescues, professional photos portraits of your pet, cat photo contest and the popular doggie water park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose: to promote kindness to animals, raise funds and awareness of animal welfare issues and inform the public how they can help our furry friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347298427000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344482398000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>14th Annual Pet ROCK Fest 2012 in Worcester, MA!</name><id>76977062</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>18000000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347206400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/76977062/</event_url></item>
