Please come out, all dogs welcomed if friendly with other dogs. We will meet up at 12:00 at Aquidneck Elementary School and at 12:30 start a walk to Trinity Park in Newport. There people will discuss these dogs, show off their friendly dogs, meet each other, talk, and there will be trainers there for advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs may come dressed up since it is so close to Halloween, just make sure the costumes are comfortable and don't make your dog over height. Also make sure you dog would be able to handle the 40 minute walk. If not perhaps bring a stroller, or just leave your pooch out of it for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring water and clean up bags.&lt;/p&gt;
