This evening's presentation will demonstrate a process of taking a strategic goal to an operations plan that has actionable goals and tactics. The Colored Pencil Project has volunteered to present a strategic goal.  They will be coached through a process that will take that goal and create tactics and objectives to enable them to make it happen. &lt;br /&gt;You are all invited to be participants in this process and to learn how to do this in your own organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you all on the 27th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Monique&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Monique Morimoto Flaherty</member_name><member_id>8025083</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256857643000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Positive Changemakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nonprofit-allies</urlname><id>591859</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nonprofit Connector</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255651171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>From Strategy to Operations: A Live Demo</name><id>11637511</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256684400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nonprofit-allies/events/11637511/</event_url></item>
