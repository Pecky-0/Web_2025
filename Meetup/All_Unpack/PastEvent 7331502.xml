Listen to Diane Georgopulos FAIA of MassHousing explain &amp;quot;the spirit of architecture&amp;quot; at a free BSA &amp;quot;Exploring Design&amp;quot; lecture at the Boston Public Library's Rabb Hall on February 20 at 6:00 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background about Georgopulos: She proposes an approach to understanding architecture (particularly Modern architecture) that goes beyond the intellectual appreciation of design to include the deepest emotional responses we have to architecture. A long-time architect at MassHousing, Georgopulos recently won the national AIA?s Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Architecture and is currently the president of the BSA. She lived in New York, Philadelphia, and London before settling in Boston and before completing her post-graduate work in architecture at MIT. Georgopulos earned her first degree in environmental design?an educational trajectory to which she attributes her interdisciplinary approach to the exploration of complex design challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's compare notes! For those of you interested in drinks afterwards, meet up by the entrance after the lecture is over. I suggest we go to &lt;a href="http://www.solasboston.com/solasboston/" target="_blank"&gt;Solas&lt;/a&gt;, a nearby bar (170 Boylston). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit &lt;a href="http://www.architects.org/lectureseries" target="_blank"&gt;www.architects.org/lectureseries&lt;/a&gt; for more information. This lecture series is pretty popular, so I recommend arriving a few minutes early to grab a seat.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Moser-Booth</member_name><member_id>6447986</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203721365000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203015932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Spirit of Architecture: Diane Georgopulos FAIA at the BPL</name><id>7331502</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203548400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/7331502/</event_url></item>
