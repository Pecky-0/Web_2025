Measure it, Understand it, and Make It better using Google Analytics!&lt;br /&gt;This event is a &amp;quot;Hands-on&amp;quot; session presented by Pradeep Aradhya, CEO, Novus Laurus LLC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date: Wednesday, April 14th, 2010 at 6pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to determine whether your website is really working for you: Do you know what customers are doing on your website?  Can you tell how many are using the site like you want them to?  Are they using the site in ways you should cater more to?  Where are they coming from?  What else can you understand about them?  How can you track this data over time?  How can you improve your web site and how it brings you business using this data?  What tools can you use to do this?  Did you know you can do all this for free using Google Analytics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to understand answers to these and other similar questions, come to this session presented and hosted by Revolve Nation.  &lt;u&gt;Bring your website and your laptop.&lt;/u&gt;  That's right! If you can push code directly to your web site, you could very well walk away from this session with analytics incorporated into your website and reports configured and ready to read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPONSORS:&lt;br /&gt;Revolve, Inc.: &lt;a href="http://www.revolvethis.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.revolvethis.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exemplar Law Partners:&lt;a href="http://www.exemplarcompanies.com" target="_blank"&gt; www.exemplarcompanies.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Marston</member_name><member_id>2731493</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>10591124</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274421154000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>entrepreneur-674</urlname><id>232461</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Revolve Nation's Boston Entrepreneur Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270228131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Is your Website really working for you?: Let's Explore Google Analytics!</name><id>13069028</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271282400000</time><rsvp_limit>27</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/entrepreneur-674/events/13069028/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/2/global_8029234.jpeg</photo_url></item>
