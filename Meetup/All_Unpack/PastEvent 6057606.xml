I will be wearing a badge, so anyone new to the group can find me.  As usual, if the group is interested, we will go out to grab something to eat after the show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winner of the poll and email votes was Bourne Ultimatum....by a landslide! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we will be watching the yummy Matt Damon in the third of the Bourne series with lots of car chases, gun fire and explosions.     Also staring in this movie are:  Julia Stiles, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Paddy Considine, Edgar Ramirez, Trevor St. John &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see trailers on the official web site: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thebourneultimatum.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thebourneu...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Matt Damon returns as the trained assassin Jason Bourne for the latest showdown in &amp;quot;The Bourne Ultimatum.&amp;quot; All he wanted was to disappear. Instead, Jason Bourne is now hunted by the people who made him what he is. Having lost his memory and the one person he loved, he is undeterred by the barrage of bullets and a new generation of highly-trained killers. Bourne has only one objective: to go back to the beginning and find out who he was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in the new chapter of this espionage series, Bourne will hunt down his past in order to find a future. He must travel from Moscow, Paris, Madrid and London to Tangier and New York City as he continues his quest to find the real Jason Bourne--all the while trying to outmaneuver the scores of cops, federal officers and Interpol agents with him in their crosshairs. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186439772000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185048635000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bourne Ultimatum</name><id>6057606</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186266600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/6057606/</event_url></item>
