So if you want to avoid the cover charge be there before. If you plan to stay a while and&amp;nbsp;order food I suggest puting your name in for a table.&amp;nbsp;Harrington's is also serving Irish breakfast starting at 8:00am. I know some people who will be there. Please let me know if you are attending early. I suggest being in line&amp;nbsp;at 7:45am. There is no cover for breakfast.&amp;nbsp;Please call Harrington's if you have any questions.&amp;nbsp;Wear Green, bring Irish Red Heads&amp;nbsp;and Happy&amp;nbsp;St. Patty's Day!***&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large group of us attended each of the last 2 years. This year St Patricks Day is on a Saturday. Oh Danny Boy!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives are going Green on Saturday, March 17 to celebrate St Patrick's Day at Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield. Harrington's is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's is all Irish, all day, all night, on both floors. There is live entertainment all day at Harrington's with&amp;nbsp;the owner Dan's band&amp;nbsp;Casterbridge Union,&amp;nbsp;Jay Buckley, Terry Weir&amp;nbsp;and Traditional Irish Seisiun. There is a $10.00 cover after 2 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear your Green and be there at&amp;nbsp;2:00 pm or whenever. The place will be packed all day and all night! I suggest any RSVPs coordinate by E Mail to meet other attendees at whatever times works best. Please RSVP and let us know approximately what time you will join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station via the Reading and Haverhill Trains stopping at Wakefield with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion to Main to Water Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to pay in cash as you order or maintain your own bar tab and settle with your server.&lt;/p&gt;
