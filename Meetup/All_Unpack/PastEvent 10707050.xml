HUMPDAY
It’s been a decade since Ben and Andrew were the
bad boys of their college campus.
Ben has settled down and found a job, wife,
and home. Andrew took the alternate route
as a vagabond artist, skipping the globe from
Chiapas to Cambodia. When Andrew shows up
unannounced on Ben’s doorstep, they easily
fall back into their old dynamic of macho oneupmanship.
Late into the night at a wild party, the
two find themselves locked in a mutual dare: to
enter an amateur porn contest together.
But what kind of boundary-breaking, envelope
pushing porn can two straight dudes make?
After the booze and “big talk” run out, only one
idea remains—they will have sex together…on
camera. It’s not gay; it’s beyond gay. It’s not porn;
it’s art. But how exactly will it work? And more
importantly, who will tell Ben’s wife?
