 &lt;br /&gt;

You will create your own masterpiece with a little wine &amp;amp; guidance from Wakefield artist Connie Festo Lafond. $39 or two for $70 includes all supplies &amp;amp; wine. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Everyone will have a matted painting of their own to bring home. In this session we will make smaller paintings..impressionistic &amp;amp; abstract flowers. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten. Then when you hit puberty they take the crayons away and replace them with dry, uninspiring books on algebra, history, etc. Being suddenly hit years later with the 'creative bug' is just a wee voice telling you, 'I'd like my crayons back, please.” - Hugh MacLeod &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
