Let's make the third one another success. Here is how: by helping our friends at Boston.com coming up with great ideas for some brand new iPhone apps! That's right, DC Denison and Bennie DiNardo of Boston.com invite our developers to present their apps and themselves, to learn about the Boston iPhone developers community, its members, its capabilities, and its achievements. We will follow a format similar to the O'Reilly Ignite where each developer will have five minutes and 20 slides to introduce himself or herself. After the presentations, we will brainstorm ideas about the new apps and plan next steps. Please let me know if you would like to present at this meetup by entering your contact information in your RSVP reply (preferred), or by sending an email to meetup@smartworlds.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Globe/Boston.com's main offices are located at 135 Morrissey Boulevard, directly across the street from Boston College High School, in the Dorchester section of Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nearest T stop is the JFK/UMass station on the Red Line.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>On the T, it's the JFK/UMass station on the Red Line.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Giuseppe Taibi</member_name><member_id>5074474</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264636714000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>iPhone Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>iphone</urlname><id>1244625</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>iPhone Developers Roundtable - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239304466000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>iPhone Meetup at Boston Globe/Boston.com main office</name><id>10153231</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240354800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/iphone/events/10153231/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/6/global_5214294.jpeg</photo_url></item>
