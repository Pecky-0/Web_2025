There was a lot of good information and examples shared by several people. &amp;quot; - &lt;i&gt;Erik Sabin&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€œ This was the first meetup I attended with Boston LOA and absolutely loved it. ... It was just great to hear other people's experiences.&amp;quot; - &lt;i&gt;psubabe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; Was inspiring, even half way through... Thanks for hosting this call, these sharings definitely help keep me pointed in the right direction.. And I like not having to travel anywhere.. Even tho I do enjoy meeting w the group. - &lt;i&gt;Diane&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Buck</member_name><member_id>2466801</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228870634000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227814752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BostonLOA TELE-Meetup: Get your pressing questions answered</name><id>9240121</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228442400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/9240121/</event_url></item>
