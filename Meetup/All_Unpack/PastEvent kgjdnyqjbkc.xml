&lt;p&gt;The New Asia Restaurant - the home of the SPRG Monthly meeting for more than 3 years - has closed its doors!  This is not a bad thing... the owner has decided it's finally time to retire, and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives US a good reason to go back to the original SPRG monthly meeting format!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, we used to move the meeting around every month trying to focus on bars and restaurants that have a reputation for Paranormal phenomena.  We're kicking this change off by holding the next Meeting at La Festa restaurant in Dover.  Although there are only a few paranormal claims we've heard about this place, the food is AMAZING!  If you want to hang out with the members of a few of New Hampshire's best ghost hunting groups in a place someone has reported as actually being haunted, here's your chance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #272727"&gt;*** ***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly dinner meetings are primarily non-mandatory networking events. Although we talk business updates sometimes for half an hour or so and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We usually sit at a table in the back private room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie Roy</member_name><member_id>4599203</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340903954000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1338845154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>kgjdnyqjbkc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340836200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/67738552/</event_url></item>
