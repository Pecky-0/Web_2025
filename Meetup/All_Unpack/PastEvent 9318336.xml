It has been a long time and more people have joined and I didn't send welcome messages and all of that. Sorry. Welcome to everyone who has shown an interest in storytelling in Cambridge! On December 27th at 9:30 at Improv Boston's Cabaret Theater (the one off to the right when you walk in) there will be a holiday show. Come listen to stories about family holiday fun and madness. It is $7 to get in. There are no nametags but if you say hey after the show I will be happy to chat. Just make sure to say, &amp;quot;I am in the meetup group&amp;quot; so I know who you are. Also in place of the nametag you can also just verbally express your name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you all can make it. It is a fun and relaxed show. Very laid back, tell your friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jess&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am hosting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>7409085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235706046000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>storytellers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>storytelling-28</urlname><id>1247871</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Greater Boston and MA Storytelling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228960888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Stories at Improv Boston</name><id>9318336</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230431400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/storytelling-28/events/9318336/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/e/global_5060862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
