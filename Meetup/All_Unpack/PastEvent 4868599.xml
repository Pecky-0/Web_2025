This meet-up, thus far, has been a conversational forum, at which we have discussed everything from world events to the field of psychology.  The goal is to look at these events from an Objectivist perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group conversation seems to flow in a variety of directions, so I always bring a copy of Robert Mayhew's book, &amp;quot;Ayn Rand Answers&amp;quot; which we consult from time to time to clarify any doubts as to what the Objectivist view would be.  Feel free to come and throw out whatever questions or comments you wish.  Come as you are, come inspired... just come with your brain turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on April 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay meetup.com $19.00 per month to use their site, so if anyone is willing to donate a couple of green-backs to &amp;quot;the cause&amp;quot; I'd be most grateful.  At the last meeting several people put in a voluntary contribution at the end of the gathering. Oddly enough, it had overtones of passing the collection plate at church, but I enjoy that kind of irony, so we'll probably continue to collect money in that fashion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1141599604000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand April Meetup</name><id>4868599</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1144011600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/4868599/</event_url></item>
