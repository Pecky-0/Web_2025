&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION CHANGED!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- We will be having this Meetup at our normal location in West Springfield - if you would like the chance to check out the group in a social way and see where we meet and who we are ... this is the chance! Bring some food to share.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August's FIFTH WEDNESDAY Community Event will be an outdoor get together at one of the Trustees of Reservations properties managed by our very own Josh Knox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had such a great time in June with a PICNIC / BBQ - that we decided to do it again! Bring your partner, your kids, your friends. Hang out, have great food, talk, throw a frisbee around, take a walk in the beautiful farm. No expectations, a super easy way to meet the guys and gals connected to OPEN MEN. Hope we will see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRING A DISH TO SHARE. BRING SOMETHING TO THROW ON THE GRILL.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring real silverware and a plate or two ... help us reduce our carbon footprint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's on the borderline between Holyoke and Springfield, MA. You and your family are welcome to attend! This will be an open, bring a dish to pass and have some grilled stuff MeetUp. We will probably take a small amount of time to check in with one another and introduce ourselves, but this is a wide open evening for relaxation and connection in community, right down by the Connecticut River.&lt;/p&gt;
