What if you could move beyond the traditional Maine growing season to &amp;quot;start earlier&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;harvest later?&amp;quot;  Many of us have been experimenting with unheated hoop houses and season extension techniques to deliver quality, nutritious and affordable food around the calender and we want to start spreading it around!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join David Homa, Tree Tenney, David Whitten and myself for a &lt;b&gt;half-day SkillShare&lt;/b&gt; on options for Season Extension and Hoop House construction.  This session, at Dave Homa's place in Otisfield (about 45 min from Portland) will focus on the what, why and how of season extension for the Maine gardener.  We will discuss the suitable crops, planting strategies/schedules and types of structures that can help you with season extension.  Dave has a great selection of structures for our &amp;quot;Show-and-Tell&amp;quot; portion of the SkillShare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE:  We will follow this up with a series of at least&lt;b&gt; three Hoop House Raising Work Parties&lt;/b&gt; in June and July!  Those of you who come to this SkillShare can throw your name in the hat to host a Hoop House Raising (and get your Hoop House built!) in the bargain.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will run this SkillShare from 9am to about 12:30.  Coffee and Tea provided.  Please bring a potluck lunch item to share as well as your own potluck kit (dish/bowl/utensils/napkin/mug).  Please dress for the weather (though we will have access to ample space under cover).  In the event of heavy rain, check this page by 7am on the day of the event to see if we have been postponed or cancelled.  Bring your camera and consider carpooling (I will open up a carpooling thread on the message board). &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1274317316000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272023738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SkillShare:  Season Extension &amp; Hoop House Strategies</name><id>13267432</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274014800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/13267432/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/c/5/global_14565781.jpeg</photo_url></item>
