Might as well come to see this new film by Ozu heir apparent Hirokazu Kore-eda, who also directed the sublime &lt;em&gt;After Life&lt;/em&gt; (1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the blurb from the Kendall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twelve-year-old Koichi lives with his mother and grandparents in a small town by a smoking volcano. His parents' divorce has split the family, with his younger brother Ryu and their feckless rock musician dad living over a hundred miles away. Koichi yearns for his family to be reunited, and when he learns that a new bullet train line will soon open—linking the two towns—he starts to believe that the combined energy when two trains pass each other at top speed could make his wish come true. With the help of friends, Koichi organizes an expedition to the mid-point of the train lines, with Ryu coming from the other direction—all of them thinking about what they would most like to wish for. A sweet ode to what we value in life, written and directed by acclaimed filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Nobody Knows, Still Walking, After Life)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who is known for his keen depictions of the trials and tribulations of everyday existence, the innocent minds of children and the warmth of family life.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday is a holiday and several films start before 7pm on Sunday, so you may want to get there early or get an advance ticket. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wait inside the theater at the end of the film.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Daniel</member_name><member_id>3074431</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338222250000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337997576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I Wish</name><id>66395812</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338157800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/66395812/</event_url></item>
