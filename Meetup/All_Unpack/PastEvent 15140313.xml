THIS EVENT IS CANCELED.&lt;br /&gt;Please join me and friends at anytime for an early afternoon of fun and exercise, or just come to watch. We will play singles or pairs in a noncompetitive game, totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be somewhat following the rules. But having fun and learning will be more important than winning.  We count the laughs, not the score. So, bring your friends and teens, your racket, balls, and your drinks to keep cool.  Donâ€™t forget your insect repellent and your smile, for an enjoyable time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and join in the fun!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287959918000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287356889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wimp Tennis</name><id>15140313</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287943200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15140313/</event_url></item>
