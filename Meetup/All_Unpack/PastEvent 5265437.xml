Should be a great venue to meet new faces and chill out.  We'll initially meet at Foundation Lounge before heading over to The Modern.  (Please see below for details.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plan: Meet at 8:30pm at Foundation Lounge (500 Commonwealth Ave, to the right of the main door at Hotel Commonwealth).  We will meet near the FRONT of the bar at Foundation.  Then head over to The Modern around 9:45pm. Please try to meet us at Foundation Lounge as it will be CROWDED at the club and finding new faces is nearly impossible. There will be a $15 cover at The Modern.  I'd like to get there before a big line forms.  Give me a call if you need help with directions or finding the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on this site, when you see the group, just introduce yourself and say you are a friend of Charlie. If your picture is up on the site, do RVSP and I'll look for you as well. My phone is 646.541.0708.  T stop is Kenmore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Lounge and The Modern are upscale scenes, so please dress to impress!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
