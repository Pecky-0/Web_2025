It boasts an impressive cast list (Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton) and marks Mike Nichols' directorial debut. The film has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 96%, with only 1 bad review out of 27. The film is also #67  on the American Film Institute's list of the Top 100 American Films ever made and garnered 5 academy awards. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a noir-ish feel and helped establish Nichols' reputation for delivering &amp;quot;intelligent, 'adult' films.&amp;quot; It is also believed that Ernest Lehman's screenplay stayed true to the play's original script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot synopsis from Rotten Tomatoes: &amp;quot;Mike Nichols' auspicious debut feature is a harrowing descent into the private lives and painful secrets of two couples thrown together for an evening.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the groups first time seeing a film at the North End Public Library, which is a short walk from the Haymarket stop on the Green and Orange lines. I know nothing of the library's set-up for showing films, so this will be a test run of sorts. Luckily, the screening is free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I was thinking we could head off to a North End cafe for food and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be holding a meetup sign after the movie is over.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole</member_name><member_id>3185465</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220650961000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219095495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf at North End Library</name><id>8571485</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220477400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8571485/</event_url></item>
