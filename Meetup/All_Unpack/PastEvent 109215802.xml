Our first meeting we will be at the "Governors Inn" in Rochester. This is a great spot where we can all get to know one another, have great conversation, and enjoy Drinks and Food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;At future get togethers we will explore other Restaurants in differnet areas in the Seacoast area or have dinner at one of our members houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Do you feel like you are exhausted from the dating scene?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Do you feel like you are alone even when you are around people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Do you feel like your friends and family are all married or taken and you are the third wheel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Do you feel like you need more options making new friendships and new relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Don’t stay home alone, join us for this fun-filled friendship mixer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Take this opportunity to meet new singles and make new friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Friendship is a powerful gift of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that friendships are harder to sustain in our busy lives today. Yet, loneliness and isolation account for an increasing societal and personal issue called depression. We are made to socialize and be with other people, but intimate, our busy lives separate us from making true connection. We need friends for health, success, and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://threestepdating.com/events/power-of-friendship-happy-hour/ivars"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Have you considered the status of your friendships lately?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the time is now to take a closer look at the value of your friendships. It seems natural, with the New Year, would come new goals and dreams. As I grow older however, I realize that my goals do not change from year to year, but my ability to achieve the goals change. I want to accomplish my goals with friends and share our successes and challenges together. I want to laugh and be serious with others that can also laugh and be serious with me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I researched the power of friendship and came up with 7 reasons of why you should be a part our group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Iron sharpens iron: Be with like-minded supportive individuals, not friends trying to hold you back, but friends that want to see you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· &lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/e/c/event_213868652.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;Goal achievement: Friends help support each other with weekly or monthly goals to keep you consistent, and you get the opportunity to encourage and help others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Accountability: Friends look out for you and wonder where you are, when you don’t show up or become missing in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Discover new things: It is better to create new memories with someone who you can reminisce with. Having good friends allows you to discover new activities, restaurants, traveling and more together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Power of Prayer: The power of prayer with others regardless of faith preference has been proven to enhance your happiness and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Less cancer and diseases: It is a proven fact that individuals with friends have less cancer, live longer and contract fewer diseases because they have friends to help with immunity, cheer them up and support them to living a healthier life together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Feel connected and not alone: When you feel that others understand you, you will have a sense of belongingness, acceptance and appreciation for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know my top 7 reasons to gain new friendships, you are personally invited to meet new friends and enjoy a great brunch while making new connections. This is not just about dating and romance but friendship first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do these events once a month but do not wait till April to get started!&lt;/p&gt;
