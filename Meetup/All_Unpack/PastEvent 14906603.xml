This is a wonderful way to celebrate Samhain (Halloween) in a traditional way while having a great time! The evening will start with a costume party from 8PM – 11PM. We will have music, refreshments and contest, including costume contest and karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the party those who wish (and ALL are invited) can stay for a short ceremony honoring family &amp;amp; friends who have passed, culminating with a traditional Witches’ Dumsupper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission to the Party is a non-perishable item for donation to the local food pantry, or a pot-luck dish to share at the party. If you wish to attend the ritual you may need 2 copper coins (or pennies) to pay the ferryman to cross the river Styx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children are welcome to the Party but due to the late hour would not be encouraged to attend the ritual. The Dumsupper will require all in attendance to refrain from speaking during the meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have invited the congregation but it would be very helpful if outside attendees would RSVP at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/calendar/11337351"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt; so we could get a more accurate headcount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information or to volunteer, please go to &lt;a href="http://www.MoonPool.org"&gt;http://www.MoonPool.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry Meet and Brightest Blessings!&lt;br /&gt;Leoric&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288579159000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285557432000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Samhain Witches Ball &amp; Dumsupper</name><id>14906603</id><headcount>37</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288396800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/14906603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/c/global_10631548.jpeg</photo_url></item>
