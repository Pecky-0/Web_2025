Hope you can join us in getting some weekday evening exercise in the company of friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: This Meetup will take place at Stewart B. McKinney Wildlife Refuge Salt Meadow Unit. (We can call it "The Bird Sanctuary" for short.) &amp;nbsp;Meet at the inner parking area (drive into park, and keep going until you reach the lot) at 5:15.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRING: Binoculars, if you like birds. If not, speak up, because bird people like to stop walking and stare for ridiculously long periods of time, which can be boring for others, and they must be nudged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COST: Please contribute one dollar towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS: I-95 North to exit 64, right at ramp. I-95 South to exit 64, left at ramp. Continue onto 145, take a left at stop sign onto Old Clinton Road. Drive a mile and you will see a sign for Stewart McKinney Refuge. (DO NOT PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY THAT SAYS "service area" -- keep going until you see the actual entrance.) Turn in, pass the outer parking section, and go up a long drive until you see some old stone houses and the inner parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
