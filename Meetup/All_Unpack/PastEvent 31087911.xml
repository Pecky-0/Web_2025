<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Launch at 10 AM. We will meet at the boat launch at the intersection of RT 9 and RT 67 (see map below). When you turn off of RT 9 on to 67, in about 20 ft on the right there is a break in the guard rail before the bridge, turn there into driveway to parking area. We will paddle east towards White's Landing then back to the launch at RT 67.&amp;nbsp; Total paddle time is approximately 3 hours.&amp;nbsp; If we can make it to White's Landing, we can get out there to stretch and have a snack. This is a typically an easy paddle on a slow moving river, but be aware if it is windy that can make this a tougher/longer paddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PLEASE NOTE - The organizers in this group are NOT trained leaders or instructors.&amp;nbsp; The organizers only set the time and place, each person participating in any group trip is responsible for their own safety.&amp;nbsp; Each participant is responsible for evaluating all relevant conditions for the trip and determining if their skills and equipment are appropriate for those conditions.)&lt;/p&gt;
