Bravo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, Sept 12th, members will meet in Quincy to catch the &lt;a href="http://www.harborexpress.com/commuters/" target="_blank"&gt;Harbor Express&lt;/a&gt; to Long Wharf. From Long Wharf, we will be taking the short walk into the North End and having dinner at &lt;a href="http://www.anticofornoboston.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Antico Forno&lt;/a&gt;, a recently renovated North End favorite noted for the quality of its brick oven-baked pizza as well as a selection of excellent Italian dishes that sample a broad range of Italian culinary tradition. Prices here are moderate for a good meal in Boston, but keep in mind that it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Andiamo a mangiare!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antico Forno&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, Sept 12 @ 6:15 PM&lt;br /&gt;93 Salem St.&lt;br /&gt;North End, Boston&lt;br /&gt;(617) 723-6733&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anticofornoboston.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Antico Forno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPECIAL NOTES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our reservation at Antico Forno is at 6:15 (The main group will be taking the 5:00 shuttle from Quincy, which is scheduled to dock at Long Wharf at 5:40). Shuttles run less frequently on weekends than during the week. After dinner, we expect to have time enough to see alittle bit of the North End, perhaps grabbing a cappuchino, before catching the last shuttle back to Quincy at 10:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be &lt;b&gt;meeting initially at The Harbor Express terminal&lt;/b&gt;, which is located just before the Fore River Bridge in Quincy. Tickets can be purchased in the ticket office (The round-trip fare is $12.00, parking at the terminal is $3.00) and you should allow a few minutes to do this. The main thing to keep in mind is that there is a Harbor Express catamaran scheduled to &lt;b&gt;depart Quincy for Boston at 5:00! DON'T MISS THE BOAT!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Harbor Express&lt;/b&gt; (Credit to &lt;a href="http://www.harborexpress.com/commuters/Directions.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Harbor Express website&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM HINGHAM, COHASSET AND SCITUATE: Take Rt. 3A North.

This is the Union Street Rotary. Exit the rotary by turning onto the Union Street, East Braintree exit, passing the Braintree Police Station on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go straight through two traffic lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next major intersection is Weymouth landing, where you will see a 7 Eleven convenience store on your left. At this point you can either bear right, heading into Weymouth Landing, or go straight, which brings you immediately to a traffic light. Go straight, then take a left at the light onto Quincy Avenue, keeping the 7 Eleven and Eastern Bank on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after you turn left there is another light at the entrance to the new Weymouth Landing MBTA station. Go straight through this light, then straight through the next couple lights, remaining on Quincy Avenue until you come to the traffic light at East Howard Street (at this light, railroad tracks cross the road and the old Fore River Shipyard, now owned by automobile tycoon Dan Quirk and full of cars, is on your right).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto East Howard Street, keeping the former shipyard on your right. Follow East Howard St for a short distance as it skirts the boundaries of the shipyard, then bears right, becoming the last section of South St. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Street ends at Washington St (Route 3A).
