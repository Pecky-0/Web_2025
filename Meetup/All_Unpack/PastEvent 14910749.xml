This meetup is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, anyone who works in Portland and can sneak away for an hour to join us, please do! It's often nice just to get out for a few minutes, socialize, make new contacts, and have some good food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click on the link below to check out their lunch menu!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theoldportseagrill.com/home.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.theoldport...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please remember, RSVP yes only if you plan to attend to allow us to make reservations.
