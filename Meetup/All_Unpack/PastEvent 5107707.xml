We'll meet at his Gallery at the Millworks Building in Uxbridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a degree form the Rhode Island School of design and after work experience as a graphic designer in New York City, Stephen G. Maka made a major career change thirty years ago and became a full-time nature photographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then he has been able to travel to many undeveloped locations around the world. These remote, vast and fragile ecosystems have not only inspired his imagery but have had a profound influence on his personal philosophy and outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His images reflect a strong sense of his fine art background producing statements with a bold graphic impact evoking an emotional response.&lt;br /&gt;Steve's photography is published internationally and has been used in most print forms including books, magazines, billboards, cards, calendars and posters. In addition to publishing, Steve_s professional commitment has led to teaching, instructing workshops, leading field trips, guiding, consulting, slide presentation, gallery exhibitions and fine-art prints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a charter member of the North American Nature Photographers Association (NANPA) Steve now serves as treasurer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please visit Steven Maka's webstite at www.makaphotography.com to get an idea of the wonderful images you will be seeing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, this is not the regular meetup.
