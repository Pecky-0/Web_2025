<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are looking for volunteers to lend a helping hand to prepare and clean up the yard for our big Beltaine&lt;br /&gt;celebration the following week-end. This will include raking, picking up sticks, setting up tables and torches, and getting the circle and fire pit ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the late never ending winter, the snow has just left our lawn, and it will be impossible for Tony to get it all done in time by himself, in less than a month. With several volunteers, we can get it done in a couple of hours! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bring your helping hands, we will provide pizza, drinks and make your own sundaes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids are welcome :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Directions will be posted on the group prior to the meet-up :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tala</member_name><member_id>5511934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209488771000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Come join us for a sense of community, gathering together for a common cause, to lend a helping hand, have fun, eat good pizza, and make ice cream sundaes! :)</why><group><who>Wiccans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wiccan-169</urlname><id>793389</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0100021362</group_lon><name>Central Mass Wiccan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207342457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beltaine Preparation Party</name><id>7674711</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209315600000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wiccan-169/events/7674711/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/d/f/global_3694063.jpeg</photo_url></item>
