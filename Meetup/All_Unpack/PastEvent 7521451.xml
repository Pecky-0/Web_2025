We will also review and practice the preterite tense.  I suggest that you also bring an article written in spanish (preferably written in the preterite) to discuss with others in small groups. There is a photocopier in the building where you can make copies for others.    However, do not be overly concerned with this detail as I will also have an article available.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is an interest we can also enjoy the delicious and reasonably priced food in the Mexican restaurant Anna's Taqueria after about 1 1/2 hours of studying. Please RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials:&lt;/b&gt; Bring a pen, pencils, paper, a Spanish\English Dictionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to find the organizer(s)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell phone number will be given out to everyone who rsvp's for this event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet just inside the building's main entrance that is closest to Massachusetts Ave., in the vicinity of the MIT Federal Credit Union and the restaurant Anna's Taqueria.  I may be standing or sitting down at the tables or chairs closest to the door.  We will then together find a place to sit down in one of the lounges or food court areas. It is fine with me if you can stay for only 1 1/2 of the 2 hours allotted for this event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Transit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MBTA:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kendall Square Red Line - Walk on Main Street in the direction opposite Longfellow Bridge. Take a left onto Vassar Street (no sign for Vassar Street) at the sign that reads Danny Lewin Square. Walk to the other end of Vassar Street and cross over to the other side of Massachusetts Avenue. Take a left and walk a short distance. You will see the concrete Stratton Building on your right. &lt;br /&gt;Hynes\ICA Green Line Boston, transfer to RT 1 Harvard\Holyoke Gate bus or walk toward Cambridge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buses:&lt;/b&gt; RT 1 Harvard\Holyoke Gate; or RT1 Dudley Station via Mass Ave.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My cell phone number will be given out to everyone who rsvp's for this event.
