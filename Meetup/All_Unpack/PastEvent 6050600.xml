Graciously, group member Frank has agreed to host this event in my absence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest by director Patrice Leconte is a low-key comedy starring Daniel Auteuil. Leconte's recent works include The Widow of St. Pierre and The Girl on the Bridge although he is probably more well-known for his films from the 90's: Ridicule, Monsieur Hire, and The Hairdresser's Husband. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is simple: an arrogant antique dealer has a birthday party where it is noticed that everyone who attends are business acquaintences. So, with the wager of a priceless vase on the line, he must produce a true friend within 10 days. With nowhere to turn, he takes the advice of a local cab-driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit  the reviews have been mixed but I think even a minor effort by Leconte will make for an enjoyble summer evening. Here is a link to one review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/films/my-best-friend-film-review-18868.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.viewlondon...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a 90 minute feature I think this would  make for a relatively painless mid-week event, with the discussion being over by 10 pm or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank  will near the front row at the movies conclusion where the group members will meet and then go to a local restaurant to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you have fun and be sure to thank Frank for me,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- For some unknown reason, I CANNOT change my RSVP status. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186095949000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184895981000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Patrice Leconte's New Movie- My Best Friend</name><id>6050600</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185922800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6050600/</event_url></item>
