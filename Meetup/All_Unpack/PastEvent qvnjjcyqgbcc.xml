It's a just for fun walk that anyone can just show up and join in. No training session or trainers for that matter. Just a nice walk to keep everyone in shape. You could show up and find 5 or 6 others or find no one. It's hit or miss. I went last week and there were about 6 of us. Use this page and the "Bully Owners New England B.O.N.E. Forum" to help find out if people are going! I see people will be there tomorrow from a post on the B.O.N.E. Forum today. These are NOT organized walks they are just random get togethers of folks who want company and to keep their dog socialized. Be Careful to ALWAYS keep your dog under control! We must always be GREAT ambassadors of the breed! Thanks and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Bully dogs!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeffrey Brandt</member_name><member_id>18326911</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335025525000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332946384000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Milford Rail Trail Dog Walks</name><id>qvnjjcyqgbcc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335020400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/58217852/</event_url></item>
