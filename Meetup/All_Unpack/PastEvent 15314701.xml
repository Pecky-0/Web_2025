So good! 10% of the day's proceeds are donated to VegWorcester. It will run from noon to 7pm, enjoy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month we are going to celebrate the one year anniversary of the first Loving Hut buffet (back then it was called Buddha Hut!). Loving Hut will be serving some special items that are not normally featured on the menu. VegWorcester will be giving them a plaque to show how thankful we are to have their monthly support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be lots of vegan cupcakes and a raffle too. Sweeeet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one to miss!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290710448000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288729026000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate 1 year of Loving Hut buffets!!</name><id>15314701</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289667600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/15314701/</event_url></item>
