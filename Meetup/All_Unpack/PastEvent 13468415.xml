Moderated by Rand Richards Cooper (Bon Appétit). &lt;br /&gt;Joining Rand Richards Cooper will be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Miller, Executive Chef at Max’s Oyster Bar in West Hartford. Chef Miller heads the Max Restaurant Group’s popular “Chef to Farm” dinners, which celebrate and support local farms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bun Lai, Owner/Chef at Miya’s Sushi in New Haven. His restaurant is the first and only sustainable sushi restaurant in the North East (one of four in America) with the largest vegetarian sushi menu in the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imani of Alchemy Juice Bar and Growing Green Co-op. 7 years in Hartford with a commitment to RAW, VEGAN, VEGETARIAN, NON-GMO, LOCAL, FRESH and ORGANIC foods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have met both Bun Lai and Imani, and they are such interesting and innovative people doing really unique things with food. Bun Lai has helped get these pesty crabs that are harming the ecosystem out of the ocean and used them in his sushi restaurant!
