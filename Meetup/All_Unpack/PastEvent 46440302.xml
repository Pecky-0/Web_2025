Meets in the SOWA building in the South End (450 Harrison Ave). The fee to participate is strictly voluntary. The purpose is to give students and Artist with limited resources a place to go draw from life. There will always be at least one model but often we have multiple models that take turns on the model stand. There is ample parking on the East side of the building in the parking lot. Entrance from Albany Street. Security requires that the building remain locked after 6pm so you must call to be let into the building. The number to call is 617-266-5140.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>7904010</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326122152000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Art Models and Artists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NE-artists-models-group</urlname><id>408475</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>New England Artists/Models Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325607525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drawing the Male Nude -  Sunday Evenings in South End</name><id>46440302</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326065400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-artists-models-group/events/46440302/</event_url></item>
