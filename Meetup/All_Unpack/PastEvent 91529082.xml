Lunch will be provided both days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #3366ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note, you can RSVP here but you must register directly with the host as follows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Send checks, along with the name, phone number, and email address of the person registering, made out to Giant's Belly Farm, 217 South Mountain Rd., Greene ME 04236.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On day one&lt;/strong&gt; we will butcher the whole pig into cuts suitable for dry curing, as well as discuss hog diets, meat curing science, and other aspects of small-scale livestock raising. We will also get to sample several organ-based food treats, share lunch, render lard and make pork stock.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;On day two&lt;/strong&gt;, we will cure a number of preparations (mostly Italian-style charcuterie), as well as grind sausage, discuss smoking meats, and share more food treats. Our intention is for everyone to be as hands-on with the curing as they are comfortable with, and to cure the whole hog in one day, with none of it going into the freezer.  &lt;br /&gt;
