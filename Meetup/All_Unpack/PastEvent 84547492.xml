In 2004, the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association and the A.D. Makepeace Company joined forces to celebrate the harvest and what it means to our region's economy and culture. We wanted an old-fashioned family festival atmosphere where the cranberry growers are the stars of the show, and that's just what you'll find at the ninth annual Cranberry Harvest Celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranberry bog tours, helicopter rides, pony rides, cooking demonstrations, juried crafters and artisans, musical performances &lt;br /&gt;

 Estimated attendees-35000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more information as soon as it is available. &lt;br /&gt;

 Feel Free to check out the web page: www.cranberryharvest.org &lt;br /&gt;

 Hours at 10 AM - 4 PM October 6 and 7th. Tickets are $5.00 Children Free&lt;/p&gt;
