I would like to see, first, if anyone would like to attend.  If we do manage to get a group, it should be wonderful!  Bring the book, if you like, and an idea for the next book.  We can then make a democratic decision on what the next book should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book I am openly suggesting is The Time Traveler's Wife  by Audrey Niffenegger only because this is the novel I am currently reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you are interested!  I am hoping we can make this a permanent addition to your calendar!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Details to follow.
