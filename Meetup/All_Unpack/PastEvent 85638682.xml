 For all you new folks that joined us Monday; thanks for coming. We know you’ll be back again! &lt;br /&gt;

 For anyone that would like to walk with us, just come on by and you’ll be introduced to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy walk, but consistency and stamina development is the key. So each week we’ll continue to walk, but increase our distance and/or activities a bit more. Last time (Oct 1st) we had an easy walk of about 1 mile. So this week we’ll increase to 2 miles (just about an hour). We had a great time walking and talking along the river with the early fall foliage just starting to color. The colors will become brilliant, and just keep getting more beautiful as each new week comes upon us. So let’s enjoy this wonderful fall location, have fun, and get some easy exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finish our walk we can visit The Heritage Restaurant, just across the street, for a snack and hot beverage. This is a great place to kick around ideas for future events here by the river, or anywhere. Event planners are always welcomed. Anything goes as long as it’s legal and can be done in public! I know I have a few crazy ideas and I'm sure you all can come up with some wild ones as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll meet between 5:30 - 5:45pm at the concert park benches just across the street from Heritage Ice Cream &amp;amp; Restaurant. For those that don’t know me, I’ll have a MEETUP pin on the back of my cap. If you come later, we’ll be walking, so just look for a group and ask everyone if they’re the MEETUP group. &lt;br /&gt;

 This is also a DOG FRIENDLY WALK, so bring them along if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make this it would be a great opportunity for us to meet. As your new organizer I will make every effort to attend most of the Portsmouth &amp;amp; Beyond posted events and meet each of you. Please keep your ideas flowing and the events coming. See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Ordway</member_name><member_id>4903547</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349759139000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349444452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Walk &amp; Talk Along the River!</name><id>85638682</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349731800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/85638682/</event_url></item>
