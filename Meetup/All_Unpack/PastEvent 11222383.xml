Small Dog Breed Group&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT:  MASS. SMALL  BREED DOG GROUP + BOSTON MALTESE/TINY DOG MEET (combined)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN:  September 27, 2009 1 - 3 pm - Time is changed because Best Friends can accommodate us the best during these two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE:  Best Friends, 150 Boston Post Road, Sudbury, MA  (978) 443 2351 - Large Camp Room&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  Best Friends is not charging us, so we will not charge you the $5 we usually charge but am asking you to instead use the money to bring refreshments, either beverages or food. I will attempt to bring a  couple of toys, but if you have any good ones that you think the group might enjoy, please feel free to bring it.  Also, I intend to bring a large water bowl for us, but if anyone can bring a back up bowl, just in case, that would be terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am donating the money necessary to subscribe to the Meetup.com services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REFRESHMENTS:  See above, please email me to let me know what you can bring:  laptopmaltese@aol.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE RSVP SOON:&lt;br /&gt; The Large Camp Room I am told can accommodate 20 - 25 LARGE dogs, so I think there is plenty of space for us small dog lovers and our dogs.  However, we need you to RSVP because there is a lot of interest in this meet, and we want to monitor numbers so that we don't become too crowded.Please don't hesitate to call or write me with questions or comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since our two groups' dogs have gotten along well at the last couple of meets, we will combine forces for this meet and continue to do so assuming that the meet will be harmonious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks BEST FRIENDS!!!!  I am thrilled to be able to have our meet at your site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small dog best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;(508) 380 6829&lt;br /&gt;(508) 561 6881&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask someone where I am!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256247950000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Small Dog Breed Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-136</urlname><id>727218</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251435762000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MASS.
