The gathering of adults will meet weekly from 6:30 to 8:30 on Wednesdays.  If you ever wanted to gain a better understanding of your abilities, or wanted to be able to control and develop the ones you know you have, this is meant for you.  Based on the native way of teaching, it will allow you to explore your abilities in healing, reading energy, psychometry, and many more ways to link to the spirit world.  Former participants have also commented on the enormous personal growth experienced through being in these classes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please e-mail me at apolfriends@earthlink.net.  The gathering will be limited to 10 people, and if more are interested, we will establish a second time of gathering.  There is no limit to people at this first gathering, however.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266017567000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263487806000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living in Your Heart Class</name><id>12318912</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265844600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/12318912/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/6/global_7518518.jpeg</photo_url></item>
