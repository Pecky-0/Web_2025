<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>There has been some interest in a possible trip to the MFA to partake in some art and writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Idea:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk around the museum for about an hour and find a piece of artwork that inspires you.  Use it to write a short piece of fiction.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup in the Museum's cafe, and share writing with other group members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;perhaps, head out for dinner and coffee/drinks afterwards .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan is subject to change, but this is the general idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been awhile since I last visited the MFA, so I see this as a great opportunity to combine two passions!  The general admission is $17 for adults over 18.  I am not currently aware of any special discounts for students or teachers, but if you are a member of the MFA admission is free.  I will look into this asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope people will be able to join and please feel free to suggest any ideas for alternative activities in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>front entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238543408000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236887867000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Writing at the Museum of Fine Arts</name><id>9941425</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238263200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/9941425/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
