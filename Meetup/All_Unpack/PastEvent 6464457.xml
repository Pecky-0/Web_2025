<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ok, the pub run is going to happen.  Short notice I know, but I want to get this one in there.  We are going to start at Atwoods in Inman Square in Cambridge and then run outbound, to stop in Central, Harvard, Porter, and end up in Davis.  With a couple possible stops in other bars.  For those of you interested, Honk fest is this weekend so we'll be running right into a big party in Davis!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to start early, especially since we are running on a pretty busy road, I'd feel better about doing this first pub run during daylight hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Honk fest &lt;a href="http://www.honkfest.org/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in sticking around after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have to drink at every bar, or really at all, but just have a good time.  I will post the entire list of bars as the week progresses so if you miss us at the first one, you might be able to find us along the route!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a favorite bar along the route, email me suggestions at jennifer_v_oneal@yahoo.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Running,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542280000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191261153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pub Run!</name><id>6464457</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191686400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/6464457/</event_url></item>
