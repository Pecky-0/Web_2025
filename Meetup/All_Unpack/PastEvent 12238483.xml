Follow trail 2.2 miles through a thickly wooded forest leading to Greeley Ponds and return the same route.  Allow 3 hours. Current snow conditions range from 1-2 feet and should be somewhat packed down (unless there is a lot of snowfall late that week) since it is a popular winter hike.   Children who are able are welcome but &lt;i&gt;must be accompanied by their adult companion at all times and especially near the ponds&lt;/i&gt; as the edges in particular can be soft/slushy even in the middle of winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TIMES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:00 AM Depart Hannaford parking lot of LL Bean Plaza Exit 14/Concord NH&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:45 AM Depart Greeley Pond Trailhead, Rte 112 Kancamagus Hwy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt; Greeley Pond Trailhead is on Rte 112/Kancamagus Highway.  Take Exit 32 off I93 and follow Rte 112 approximately 9.5 miles (from Rte 112 N Conway it would be about 26 miles).  From the south he trailhead is after Big Rock Campground but before the hairpin turn at Hancock Overlook.  The trailhead parking lot is plowed in winter, has somewhat limited parking, and you need a WMNF parking pass.    We will take the hiking trail which has plowed access not the ski trail which Is .2 miles from the hiking trail (The more obscure ski trail does not have a kiosk so you probably would not accidentally arrive there anyway).&lt;br /&gt;Organizer:   Diane King /4K Diane&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us in the parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>4KDiane</member_name><member_id>7411900</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265656594000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262774525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greeley Ponds Snowshoe Hike</name><id>12238483</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265467500000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12238483/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/d/6/global_12520310.jpeg</photo_url></item>
