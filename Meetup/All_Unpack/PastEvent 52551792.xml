For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine from CA in honor of Denise (no boxed wine or Yellow Tail please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvres or desert.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;This invitation will go out to 3 groups of 20 people ea.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Please bring your own expendable glass in case it breaks or you forget it.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I have some, but not enough for all even though I now have some extra Benmarl wine glasses now. If&amp;nbsp;you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;$15 or more&lt;/strong&gt;. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $25 or more in multiples of $15 depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste. Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing... Reds Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, shiraz pinot noir, whites - sav blanc, chards, Riesling, pinot grigio, etc. Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a person&amp;rsquo;s spot if you do not show up. *Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I will have water and coffee too. &amp;nbsp; Enjoy, responsibly!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ralph</member_name><member_id>8774347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331644183000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329367703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wine Night @ Ralph's House</name><id>52551792</id><headcount>60</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1331420400000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/52551792/</event_url></item>
