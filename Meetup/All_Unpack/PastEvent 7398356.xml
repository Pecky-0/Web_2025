Bare Cove is not a circular trail, therefore, at some point we will have to turn around. I'm not sure of the actual mileage of the trail, but to date, I have not reached the end, so it's fairly long.  For our first meetup I was thinking about a half hour to 45 minute walk then turn around for a total of about a little over an hour walk, just to see how the pups take to each other.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my first organized pack walk, however we have participated in quite a few. All you do is show up with your leashed dog and we all walk together, socialize and let the dogs mingle as we lead the way. It's actually remarkable the way they fall into the pack mentality. After the initial excited 5-7 minutes of greeting each other and finding their comfortable slot in the pack, they settle in and march like soldiers. Please bring water for the walk. I will provide bowls and water for the beginning and end of the walk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: If it is raining, too hot, too cold, etc. a cancellation notice will be sent via email and posted on the meetup website 1.5 hours prior to the meetup time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a GROUP fee and if not paid, our meetups would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be greatly appreciated if at each meetup, each member can submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will wait by the front entrance of the trial near the green forest board.
