Friday the 27th is the next so let's take advantage of it.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks to the generosity of the Highland Street Foundation, all Museum visitors receive complimentary Exhibit Halls admission on Friday, August 27. In addition to our regularly scheduled presentations, exhibits, and activities, enjoy entry to our traveling exhibits, George Washington Carver and Whales | Tohor&amp;#257;&amp;quot;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Access to the M.C. Escher exhibit is also included with the free admission.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will couple the visit with an optional OMNI format IMAX movie.  Arabia looks good but starts at 6:00 so will need to get there early.  Cost of the movie is $10.50.  For those not interested in the movie we will meet at 7:00 by the main entrance.  Weather permitting we may head to the Gilliland Observatory at about 8:30 to see the stars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info about the IMAX and observatory&lt;br /&gt;In the Mugar Omni Theater, the world's largest film format is projected onto a five-story-tall IMAXÂ® Dome screen.  OMNI films are special films created for 180 degree viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gilliland Observatory is equipped with a computer-controlled, Celestron CGE 1100 Schmidt Cassegrain telescope and staffed by knowledgeable Museum employees, this is the perfect place to end a Friday evening at the Museum. Weather permitting, the observatory is open every Friday, 8:30 - 10:00 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Dining at the museum ends at 6:00 so for those interested will need to figure out dinner plans.  Too bad as Friday night museum dinners were provided through part of the gourmet chef Wolfgang Puck franchise and offered some of Boston's finest dining at reasonable prices. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will send out my # day before the meeting and will have a meetup sticker on</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary</member_name><member_id>10329460</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>46</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283696410000</updated><rating><average>4.09000015259</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>79</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281568521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Museum of Science exhibits Free Friday and IMAX</name><id>14395583</id><headcount>79</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282945500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14395583/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
