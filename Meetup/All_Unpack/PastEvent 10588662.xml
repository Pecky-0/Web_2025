Yes, it's been 1 year since just a hand full of us got together at my place to create a warm and relexed atmosphere where we could come and feel at home. Now, a year later and we'll be 400 strong, we're a thriving group with tons of things to do every month and good people to do it with.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's our usual format. BYO-EVERYTHING. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYOB  &lt;br /&gt;BYOfood  &lt;br /&gt;BYOfriends &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always ABSOLUTELY NO DRUGS, PERIOD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start at about 4PM. Kids are always welcome at our place as are your friends. There are always at least 2 open bars so BYOB and Mixers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ICE IS ALWAYS WELCOME &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your iPod, CD's and other format music. If you've got Karaoke CD's bring them too.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have hot plates out and warmers, 2 ovens crank'n and lots of fridge space.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is plentiful. Just don't block the driveway.  &lt;br /&gt;Good places: Down by the garage, on both sides of the driveway. in the parking area in front of the house on the street, and along the road but not on neighbors lawns.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've got lots of goodies to unload, pull up to the front door, bring them inside and then park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a pianist, you'll have a choice of 2 grand pianos. Singers, join right in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Write or call to coordinate what you're bringing for food.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parties traditionally go pretty late (1am or so) but you can come and go as you please.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're early and have yard games like Volleyball, bad minton etc, feel free to bring em.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all starts On Sat, Jun 13th at 4PM but many don't show up till the evening or later. The dress is casual. Smiles required.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an assistant organizer or organizer of another group, feel free to post this event on your calendars.
