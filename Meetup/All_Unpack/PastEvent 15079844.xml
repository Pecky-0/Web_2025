The others have been so successful everyone has been asking me when the next one will be.  Munib (user name Wanag) is opening up his house for our get together! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to teach anyone who is not familiar with the art.  If there are other professionals who would be willing to teach others the art of massage I welcome them.  We will be having a group massage as well as a group hug. There is no cost for the massage.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a chair, loose comfortable clothing, and some good food to share (potluck).  Also bring a massage table if you have one and any soothing oils that you like. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at: 603-509-2907 or if you need further directions you can call Munib at 781-718-6970.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a combined event with the Social Fun meetup group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing everyone there for an interesting night of massage and interesting discussions! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will send the directions to those who RSVP Yes as we get closer to the night of the event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your first name begins with the following letter, here are some suggestions for the pot luck portion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A-E = soup or salad (with dressing/s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;F-I = an entree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;M = bring plates, utensils, or napkins, and trash bags&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;N-R = bread or dessert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;S-Z = beverages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring something nutritious and have something to serve it with (ladle, spoon, or fork) and be prepared to bring home your leftovers after the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would also love it if we can get a few hands after the event to stay and help clean up.  There is a large group attending this function, and we want to be as welcoming a Guest as possible!  Munib has a beautiful home, I would hope to make sure we leave it as wonderful as when we arrive.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289752933000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286852468000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Massage Night </name><id>15079844</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289689200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15079844/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/0/global_5306000.jpeg</photo_url></item>
