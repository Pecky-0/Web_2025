&lt;p&gt;Host: Steve Ob1. 603-491-1962  ob@tds.net &lt;br /&gt;

 RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT!   THIS IS A DOG &amp;amp; CHILD FRIENDLY EVENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us at anytime. If you can make it at 1 pm.?  I will have my phone on, 603-491-1962 &lt;br /&gt;

 The trails crisscross each other. This it an easy hike on the trails at Mine Falls Park in Nashua. Please know this is not a race. My intent is to enjoy the views of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a good workout. The trails will be more wet than snowy. The trail are paved and dirt. So, I thought that we &lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/0/8/event_164046152.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;would enjoy the nice day and nature for about two or three hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. This park is just full of beautiful views and history. So, come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of new and old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 1:00 pm in the lot at the end of Coliseum Ave, which is off of Rte 130 in Nashua. Steve Ob1. will be doing the introductions at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS: Take exit 6 from Route 3 (Route 130) and go west towards Brookline, take the second entrance to the shopping center area (Colliseum Ave), go all the way to the end of the road for the parking lot. Look for the meetup sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a drink or hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
