The chef and owner were both born in Southern Italy, hence most dishes include red sauce. It's a very popular restaurant on the lower left side of Hanover Street as you walk down from the Greenway. It also has the North End's most distinctive sign- a bottle pouring wine into a glass. So you can't miss it. Appetizers run $10-14 Pastas $17-19 and Meat/Fish $17-30. As usual, we'll have our cocktail hour around the bar from 6:00-7:00 for those who can get there a little early. We'll sit down to order at about 7:00. After dinner, for those with a little more time, we'll go for a drink to help us digest all that Italian food. The nearest T-stop to the North End is Haymarket.
