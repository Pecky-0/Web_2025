Enjoy the crisp air as we walk and chat. You'll find that time goes by quickly. Since Wollaston is so well lit, we will be fine walking in the dark. Plan on walking 1-1.5 hours. The parking lot to Dunkin and back is about 4 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we have confirmed that the parking lot is open until 9pm, so no worries about the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to dress in layers as it can be windy and cool along the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this event, please contact me. THANKS! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wollaston Beach Walk &lt;br /&gt;Monday, November 16th 6pm &lt;br /&gt;Caddy Memorial Park &lt;br /&gt;Quincy Shore Drive &lt;br /&gt;Quincy, MA &lt;br /&gt;(the park by the traffic light across the street from the beach) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fees: Organizer Team and Annual Members - Free, Members and Guests - $2 per person (Cash Only.

Look for me there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will meet by the flagpole</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258845155000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258425216000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another evening walk at the beach</name><id>11891433</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258671600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/11891433/</event_url></item>
