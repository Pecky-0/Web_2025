&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I work on getting back in hiking form after a long hiatus, another afternoon walk at Northwest Park in Windsor. It will be more of a walk in the woods than a serious hike as we'll cover 2-3 miles of rolling trails, likely with views of Rainbow Reservoir. Meet in the parking lot at 11:00 and expect to be out on the trail 1-2 hours at a social (slow) pace. Kids and dogs welcome.   Check back that morning to see if I have updated the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
