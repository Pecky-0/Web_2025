We'll start from the kiosk described below, hike thru the Flat Rock Wildlife Sanctuary then onto Falulah brook. &lt;br /&gt;

An extensive trail system traverses the sanctuary and park and leads you through a number of habitats including rocky ledges, hemlock groves, dry upland forest and wetlands. Look for signs of deer, fox and coyote along the trails. Hike leader: Richard F. cell phone 978-846-7958. Plan to arrive 15 minutes early unless you know the kiosk location described below.&lt;/p&gt;
