We will summit Monadnock, one of the most hiked mountains in the world. Meet at the HQ Parking Lot. We'll try a slightly different route for those of us that have done the traditional white cross/white dot before. We'll summit on the White Dot/Cascade Link/Red Spot/Smith Connecting/White Dot route, which is a 2.4 mile ascent with an elevation gain of 1807 feet. We'll eat lunch at the top and then descend using the less traveled Pumpelly trail to Cascade Link/White Spot which is a gentler 3.5 mile descent. Bring plenty of water, snacks, lunch, and hiking boots! Plus rain gear if the forecast looks iffy! Pouring rain cancels but drizzle/showers will not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Jenn Brown and I are leading a series of hikes to prepare us for the Mt Washington hike on Memorial Day weekend. We are starting with some easier ones and working our way up to some more difficult terrain and elevation gains, so if you go on a bunch of these then you should be ready to tackle Washington with us in late May.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272378903000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268490854000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Monadnock</name><id>12865890</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272205800000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/12865890/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_13613560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
