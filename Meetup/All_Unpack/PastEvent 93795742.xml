&lt;p&gt;Please join the Red Sox Natives and Boston Happy Hour and others to welcome the first ever Morgan White Jr. (from WBZ Radio) Trivia Night at Laurie's 909 Steakhouse and Raw Bar with $1.00 Oyster Night. This is a one-of-a-kind trivia event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan is the undisputed Master of the Trivia Universe. After 30 years he continues to amaze folks with his one-of-a kind trivia show at which you provide categories and he uses his mind-boggling breadth of knowledge to create questions on the spot for your chance at prizes. Along with being smart Morgan is personable and exudes a geeky coolness. The game format is very simple, the first table to answer three questions correctly in a round wins a prize. There isn't any need to figure out a team name, submit answer sheets nor calculate team scores...it's easy breezy as well as highly entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on Mr. White &lt;a href="http://www.morganwhitejr.com"&gt;http://www.morganwhitejr.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia begins at 7:00 p.m. and ends by 9:09 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get there when you can and stay as long as you are able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are more than welcome to show up for the trivia or just the camaraderie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a cocktail or two or three and order the $1.00 Oysters, an appetizer or dinner from Laurie's the full menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All categories are welcome by Morgan for questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be Beatles categories at this event and why?&lt;/p&gt;
