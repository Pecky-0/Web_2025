I'm going for a 2.5 to 5 mile walk after work at Lincoln Woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I plan to walk the first time around at 5:30pm&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can't make it at this time, feel free to join at the &lt;strong&gt;second time around which will most likely be around 6:20pm&lt;/strong&gt;. If you plan to catch me on the second go-around, then please wait by the Lincoln Woods State Park sign at the Rt. 146 (Twin River Rd) entrance, just past the booth. I'll catch up with you then and you can join me on the second round. The park closes at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once around Olney Pond is about 2.5 miles, and I am going for twice around. You are welcome to quit anytime, or you're welcome to join me 2 times around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Lincoln Woods, then I will meet you near the Rt. 146 (Twin River Rd) booth entrance. There is a sign right after the entrance when you come in that says Lincoln Woods State Park. You can park on the side in the dirt anywhere near the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a map with of the park: &lt;a href="http://www.riparks.com/pdfs/lincolnmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln Woods State Park Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting by the Rt. 146 entrance, next to the sign right when you come in.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309958472000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309435882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk 2.5 to 5 miles @ Lincoln Woods</name><id>24080211</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309901400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/24080211/</event_url></item>
