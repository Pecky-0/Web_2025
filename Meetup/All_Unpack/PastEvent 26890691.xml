&lt;p&gt;This is a ' 
&lt;em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;tagalong event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ' which our Meetups want to attend, but tagalong events have what we call ' 
&lt;em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;flowdown provisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ' that are determined BY the host of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is being put on by the&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;a href="http://www.BostonVeg.org"&gt;Boston Vegetarian Society&lt;/a&gt;. Advance registration was required to attend ($15). Registrants registered in advance at&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/192808"&gt;http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/192808&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event has now sold out. &amp;nbsp;GBBCC set the rules for the event and is not allowing additional people to come to the talk only because they are concerned about capacity. &amp;nbsp;Therefor, the host - GBBCC - are not allowing people to enter much before 6, so there's little point in going early, although there will be open seating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please direct any questions you may have to info@BostonVeg.org&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:00 PM - Vegan Dinner Buffet&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;7:30 PM - Speaker: Jill Robinson&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Don't miss this chance to hear this leading light in the worldwide animal protection movement -- and have a scrumptious vegan Chinese Buddhist dinner! &amp;nbsp;The $15 fee covers the buffet dinner, including tax and service!&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We are honored to present Jill Robinson, who has been on a remarkable journey of courage, compassion, and achievement on behalf of animals in Asia. &amp;nbsp;Jill is Founder and CEO of Animals Asia Foundation (AAF) headquartered in Hong Kong, with Moon Bear Rescue Centers in China and Vietnam, offices in six countries, and 270 staff worldwide.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The event begins with a delicious vegan buffet dinner, prepared Chinese Buddhist style. &amp;nbsp;PRE-PAYMENT for the dinner is required, deadline Thursday, Aug. 18 at 9 AM.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;In 1993, Jill Robinson began the first investigations into the practice of bear farming in China. Her &amp;nbsp;discoveries changed both the course of her life and the course of animal welfare in Asia.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Jill discovered that across China, Asiatic Black Bears, known as Moon Bears, are factory-farmed under deplorable conditions for the procurement of bile, and having CITES Endangered Species status has not protected them. &amp;nbsp;Bear bile is used in Traditional Medicine. &amp;nbsp;Its medicinal properties can be replaced with inexpensive and effective herbal and synthetic alternatives.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Jill's discovery of the bear farming industry led her to form the Animals Asia Foundation (AAF), and to embark on years of tireless negotiations with the Chinese Government. In 2000, a landmark agreement was signed between AAF and the Sichuan State Forestry Administration to free 500 Moon Bears from a lifetime of suffering, and work towards the elimination of bear farming in China.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;AAF's work has expanded into campaigns to change hearts and minds about the treatment of animals throughout all of Asia. &amp;nbsp;Their "Friends or Food?" campaign tackles the issue of dogs and cats being used for food and fur in China, working in schools with their "Dr. Dog" and "Professor Paws" initiatives.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;BIO:&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Jill Robinson, a vegetarian, was awarded the British MBE as well as the Genesis Award and Readers Digest Award for her work in Animal Protection. She has given hundreds of presentations and major media interviews, including being a guest on NPR/ WBUR's "On Point." &amp;nbsp;Animal Planet's one-hour documentary on AAF aired throughout Asia and Europe.&amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Jill is from England and currently divides her time between Hong Kong, AAF's Moon Bear sanctuary in Chengdu, and speaking around the world on issues facing animals in Asia and the strides being made to help them.&amp;nbsp;
