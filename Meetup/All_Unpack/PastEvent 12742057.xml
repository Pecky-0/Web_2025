I WAS GETTING FEEDBACK THAT FROM MEMBERS WHO WANTED TO JOIN BUT COULDN'T BECAUSE OF EASTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I'M HOPING TO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE TO JOIN  FOR THIS WEEKEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of our members suggested this Austrian restaurant in Cheshire. After doing a little bit of research (and trusting the opinion of our trusty member), I think it's finally time to check this place out! It's a little bit of a hike from West Hartford, which is why I chose Saturday evening instead of Friday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! Please see details below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cammy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch Factory Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;122 Elm Street, &lt;br /&gt;Cheshire, CT 06410 &lt;br /&gt;Phone: 203-271-1717 &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271113389000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Smiling Happy Faces</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford</urlname><id>1498492</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>Eat, Laugh, and Be Merry in West Hartford</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267447459000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Watch Factory Restaurant</name><id>12742057</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270940400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford/events/12742057/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/e/7/global_9949255.jpeg</photo_url></item>
