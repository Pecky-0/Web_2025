RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT &lt;br /&gt;

How many of us have lived in this region and have yet to go to the Lowell National Heritage Park and learn about the local history of textile manufacturing? We will meet in the parking lot of the Visiting Center at 304 Dutton Street at 1:00 pm. &lt;br /&gt;

See below link for the list of buildings we can visit. &lt;br /&gt;

I plan on browsing the area till around 4:00 or 4:30. Letâ€™s plan on going to eat at one of the restaurants downtown. &lt;br /&gt;

There is no need to RSVP no. &lt;br /&gt;
