Beginning in a sleek Los Angeles nightclub, the film shows Julia as she would like to be seen, beautiful and intoxicating. But by morning when Julia wakes once again in bed with a man she doesn’t know, the flattering light of evening has worn off, exposing the harsh reality underneath. Julia’s life knows no real friendships and no real meaning. Any shred of normalcy has slowly been eaten away by the constant pull of alcohol, which has replaced all other drives as the guiding force of Julia’s life. When Mitch (Saul Rubinek), her only friend and a recovering alcoholic, pushes her to attend an AA meeting, she meets her neighbor, Elena (Kate del Castillo). From there, Julia finds herself facing unexpected temptation as Elena shares a highly flawed plan to kidnap her own son, Tommy (Aidan Gould), from the wealthy grandfather he is living with. Elena promises money, and Julia can’t resist, embarking on a messy and sadistic journey that goes wrong at every turn and grows more complicated as her relationship with Tommy develops. French Director Eric Zonca provides an ample platform on which his lead can display her many talents. Never shying away from serious, complex roles, Swinton carries the film with her nuanced and heart-wrenching portrayal of an out-of-control drunk. While it can be hard to watch at times, viewers will find themselves sucked in as Julia’s life spins speedily downhill. With her piercing stare and undeniable screen presence, Swinton demands our attention, whether we like it or not.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the Movie, right side of the theater near the screen. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>4007722</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260804604000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260134243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Julia" at the MFA</name><id>12030906</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260630900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12030906/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/6/global_12117222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
