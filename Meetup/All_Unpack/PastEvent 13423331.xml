The foliage reports that I've read claim near peak or peak conditions this weekend. Of course this means it will be on the busy side. We'll take our time, have patience :-), and I'm sure we'll find PLENTY of photo ops. If we need to change plans on the fly we will. I'll have a variety of options available to us--it's going to be a great weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the two days I hope for us to see/shoot the following: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterfall(s) &lt;br /&gt;Cathedral Ledge (top) and Echo Lake &lt;br /&gt;Covered Bridges &lt;br /&gt;Pumpkin People (Jackson, NH) &lt;br /&gt;Foliage (of course!) &lt;br /&gt;Kancamagus Hwy (at least part) &lt;br /&gt;Crawford Notch State Park &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cell phone coverage can be hit or miss in the White Mountains. If you're going to be very late arriving Saturday morning I'd suggest calling my cell phone early. Once in the mountains I may, or may not, be able to receive your call. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting at 10:30a.m. at Applebee's in North Conway. The address is: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Street at Settlers Green &lt;br /&gt;North Conway, NH 03860 &lt;br /&gt;(603) 356-9600 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we'll figure out carpooling and go over the itinerary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to bring: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacket &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Wet&amp;quot; shoes if you tend to venture into water to get the perfect shot :-). &lt;br /&gt;Shoes appropriate for hiking/walking &lt;br /&gt;Tripod &lt;br /&gt;Filters (neutral density, polarizing, etc..) &lt;br /&gt;GPS (if you have one) &lt;br /&gt;Cell Phone &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you all Saturday morning. This is going to be a great weekend! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken</member_name><member_id>5082371</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366430166000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273339640000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Autumn in the White Mountains</name><id>13423331</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286029800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/13423331/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_3584529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
