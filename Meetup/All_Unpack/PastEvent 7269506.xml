If there is interest we can grab a bite afterwards. There are a few places in the strip mall where we went last week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note you will need to pass a belay tested if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can also take a class if you have never climbed before. They have a shuttle to the gym from the Wellington T Station if you don't have a car. Look up Metro Rock's web site - or give them a call. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great week, &lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be hanging out at the picnic table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2680784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204252843000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202238753000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I vote to climb on Friday! :o)</name><id>7269506</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202515200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/7269506/</event_url></item>
