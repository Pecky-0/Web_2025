<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a &lt;b&gt;Mini-Meetup&lt;/b&gt;.  If you are wondering why there so few RSVPs, take a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/messages/boards/thread/9907478"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;.  Please be respectful of others who may want to RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people when they hear Mahjong think of the solitaire version they play on the computer, where you remove pairs of tiles.  While that game uses the same tiles, it isn't the real Mahjong.  The real game is a 3-4 person strategic game that involves drawing and playing tiles, and has similar mechanics to that you would find in card games (such as creating melds).  The game also has a culture that is tied up with mafia, illegal gambling and geisha girls.  This event will focus on playing this real form of Mahjong and is geared towards newbies who want to learn the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless people speak up otherwise, we will be using a Japanese Mahjong set and we will play using Japanese rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to plan for 8 RSVPs assuming we can get our hands on two sets.  I can secure one set.  If someone else owns a set, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food theme for this Mini-Meetup will be &amp;quot;asian&amp;quot; food.  You are free to interpret that however you want, if you decide to bring something. We will have something on hand as a default.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the location:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickman Street is located between the Commons and the water.  Parking on Pickman can be tight, but there should be ample parking along either Pleasant Street (by the Commons) or Collins Street (by the water)&lt;br /&gt;It will take place on the third floor unit.&lt;br /&gt;Note: there will be two cats present that will be very very sad if they have to get locked up.  They are very polite however.  If anyone would like to attend but has allegeries please send me a private message.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ryan</member_name><member_id>8995629</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292203715000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287416605000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mini-Meetup: Mahjong</name><id>15146625</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292094000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/15146625/</event_url></item>
