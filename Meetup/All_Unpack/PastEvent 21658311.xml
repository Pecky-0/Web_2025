JUSTIN MARTIN as he discusses his newest work, Genius of Place: The
Life of Frederick Law Olmsted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frederick Law Olmsted is arguably the most important historical
figure that the average American knows the least about. Best
remembered for his landscape architecture, from New York's Central
Park to Boston's Emerald Necklace to Stanford University's campus,
Olmsted was also an influential journalist, early voice for the
environment, and abolitionist credited with helping dissuade
England from joining the South in the Civil War. This momentous
career was shadowed by a tragic personal life, also fully portrayed
here. Most of all, he was a social reformer. He didn't simply
create places that were beautiful in the abstract. An awesome and
timeless intent stands behind Olmsted's designs, allowing his work
to survive to the present day. With our urgent need to revitalize
cities and a widespread yearning for green space, his work is more
relevant now than it was during his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
