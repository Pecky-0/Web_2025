The August Restaurant of the month is Bedford Village Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Restaurant of the Month:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the roots of the Bedford Village Inn are in historic New England, the crown jewel of the property is the contemporary regional cuisine and warm hospitality – and the BVI Restaurant has earned myriad accolades distinguishing it as a nationally acclaimed New Hampshire restaurant. Three dining venues, the Dining Room, the Tavern, and Corks offer you a choice for whatever your mood.     &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Critical portions of the cuisine come from numerous high-end local regional producers and farmers throughout the Bedford, New Hampshire area.  Local produce means natural freshness.  So the eggs that make your souffle’ so fluffy are plucked warm from a henhouse in Londonderry, as does the maple syrup drizzling down the best buttermilk pancakes around.  And that nice thick slab of apple-wood bacon comes from “the north country” in Claremont.  The chickens come from our neighbors to the west in Vermont. Dairy and seasonal cheeses come from some of the most uniquely named pet goats and blue-ribbon sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Gordon family residence (circa 1790) was renovated and transformed into seven beautifully appointed dining rooms that together comprise The Bedford Village Inn’s nationally acclaimed New Hampshire restaurant. Most dining rooms feature fireplaces for that warm and cozy atmosphere to celebrate or for a romantic table for any occasion. The dining rooms are individually decorated and each seats from 12 to 55 people. This is the perfect New Hampshire restaurant for hosting a smaller wedding, rehearsal dinner, birthday party or corporate dinner. We serve breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, Brunch on Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contemporary New England Regional Cuisine is the crown jewel of The Bedford Village Inn, garnering a myriad of accolades distinguishing it on a national level. The restaurant also boasts a full pastry/bakeshop where our Executive Pastry Chef oversees production of all baked products served on the property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bedfordvillageinn.com/new-hampshire-restaurants/dining-room/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://bedfordvillage...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Menu:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bedfordvillageinn.com/new-hampshire-restaurants/wine/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://bedfordvillage...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bedfordvillageinn.com/map-directions/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://bedfordvillage...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250961906000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249388764000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FAN Restaurant of the Month</name><id>11031198</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250377200000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/11031198/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/c/9/global_10031065.jpeg</photo_url></item>
