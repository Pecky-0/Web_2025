The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has provided billions of dollars in stimulus money, some of which has gone into green-tech. However, clean energy and the bio versions in particular, have been hit hard by the economy. Venture investments are hard to come by these days, but deals are still getting done. And yet the trend is so compelling that a Bio-economy keeps emerging with bio-agriculture, bio-energy, bio-products taking on new emphasis in our national quest for energy&lt;br /&gt;independence and sustainability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our EntreTech panel of investors and technologists will emphasize the investment capital, growth capital, businesses, and technologies that present eco-sustainable activities for this emerging bio-economy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we will explore...What is our panel seeing for this year and the future for themselves and their business â€“ which you can apply? What new trends are underway? What efforts or obstacles need to be overcome, as they move forward? And of course, who has the money, who is providing the money and how does our audience get theirs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moderator:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Larry Grume&lt;/b&gt;r, Technology Associates &amp;amp; Alliances, iVEST Partners LLC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keynote: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sam Nejam&lt;/b&gt;e, Founder, Promotum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curtis S.
