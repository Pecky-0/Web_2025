We will be playing football this weekend at noon at Russell Field. Join in the fun. It doesn't matter what skill level you are, just bring a good attitude. We play on a turf field, so don't worry if you don't have spikes. Come join in if you haven't been yet, its a great way to meet people in a relaxed environment. Also a good way to get some fresh air and stretch your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The field is just across the Alewife Brook Pkwy from the Alewife stop on the Red Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there will be the 1st Annual TURKEY Bowl on November 28th. We will have a tournament, with referees, rules, flags, penalties, and we'll keep track of the score. We will play whether it rains, snows, or shines. Just throwing that out there. The formal event will be posted shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it this weekend,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227375870000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226507319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT - 12PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>9147586</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226768400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/9147586/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
