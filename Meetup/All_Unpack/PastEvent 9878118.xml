When we begin to look deeply, we can see the subtle ways that fears come into our thoughts. Mindfulness is a way to begin exploring fears, how they limit our capacity to live with authenticity, and to clearly see these fears so that we can integrate them into our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this week's meetup, we'll discuss the nuances of fear and how it can show up in our minds and hearts. Included will be several shorter meditations and possibly some readings on the topic as food for discussion. Come join our weekly meeting for mindful community and spiritual connection. All levels welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people at the door until 6pm</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239653505000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236170888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup: Fear</name><id>9878118</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239055200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9878118/</event_url></item>
