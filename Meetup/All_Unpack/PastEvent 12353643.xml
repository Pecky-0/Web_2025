<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Member of the Vegan Metro West Network and avid reader, Robin Schulman has suggested we start a book club.  Great idea Robin!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past months books related to veganism on compassion, sustainability and health are coming out faster than I can keep up.  Among the newer releases are -&lt;br /&gt;“Eating Animals” by Jonathan Safran Foer, &lt;br /&gt;“Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs and Wear Cows: An introduction to Carnism” by Melanie Joy and &lt;br /&gt;“The Kind Diet: A Simple Guide to Feeling Great, Losing Weight, and Saving the Planet” by Alicia Silverstone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this new found knowledge, Robin and I feel the need to talk about it! She has graciously offered her house for book club meetings.  It’s difficult to get these newer, high demand books out from the library, so we decided to begin with “The World Peace Diet” by Dr. Will Tuttle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be prepared to discuss what you have read.  We will have a leader to guide discussion of the topics presented in the book.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.willtuttle.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.willtuttle...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Mangus</member_name><member_id>8074795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266956152000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263840519000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>VMWN Book Club: Discussion of “The World Peace Diet” by Will Tuttle Ph.
