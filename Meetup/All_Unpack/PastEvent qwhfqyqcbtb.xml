Whether you are an experienced drummer or just starting out, there is space for you in our circle. And what would a circle be without dancers? So come and join us for this joyous celebration of life. &lt;/b&gt; - Bring your drums, rattles, Native American flutes, digeridoos, etc. We will open up the room and get it rocking with the rhythms. There will be space made for both heart-pounding beats and softer rhythms with room for voices and instruments.&amp;amp;nbsp;Suggested donation of $5&amp;amp;nbsp;to cover the costs of maintaining this Meetup group, and the costs of electricity and heat for the church. &lt;b&gt;If you have instruments to share, please bring them!&lt;/b&gt; url=http://www.maldenuua.org/]The First Parish in Malden[/url]&lt;/b&gt;, a Unitarian Universalist congregation, is located three blocks west of the Malden Center T station at 2 Elm Street (intersection with Pleasant Street), just off Route 60.
