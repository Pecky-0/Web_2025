The pieces for the concert will include classical and popular music.  She will be playing solo, as well as an accompanist, including with high-school-aged winners &amp;amp; other runner-ups of the Hamden Symphony's Youth Concerto Competition.  7-9pm, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be a problem if you had to come late or leave early (though that might mean you miss Alexis' solo).  In the Buckman Center at Quinnipiac Univ. in Hamden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;POST-PARTY:&lt;/b&gt; There's a pretty high likelihood that we'll be up for hanging-out in some fashion afterwards if anyone's interested...food, drink?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rotary Club is devoted to fans of highway rotaries in all their gloriousness.  Either that or they're a community service organization, I keep getting that mixed-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear Alexis playing some Mozart at her site: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist" target="_blank"&gt;www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST:&lt;/b&gt; Donation (to benefit Rotary Club)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/members/2469731/"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt; 203-747-9203 (however due to teaching + warm-up, she may be pretty un-reachable all day until the concert is done; texting may be your best shot at reaching her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/members/2254163/"&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt; 203-901-4957 (calling or texting is fine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;  It'll be in the Buckman Center at Quinnipiac Univ. in Hamden.  For general directions to Quinnipiac click &lt;a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x28.xml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  When you enter Q.U., ask the guard for directions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want, you can see a campus map &lt;a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x33.xml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Assuming you're entering from the front main entrance (Mt. Carmel Ave)...not the Harwood entrance (also on Mt. Carmel Ave)...&lt;a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x35.xml"&gt;Buckman Center&lt;/a&gt; is a circular building set fairly far back on campus towards the right.  You could enter through the New Road entrance (on the right side), which will put you much closer, but I don't know how much parking is available there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to arrange car-pools, chat about the event, etc, click &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/messages/boards/thread/5561987/0#21836571"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to visit the thread on the message board&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225383767000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223415297000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thu 10/9 - Alexis benefit concert for Rotary Club </name><id>8917569</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223593200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8917569/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
