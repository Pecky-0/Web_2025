You wind through 10-foot-tall marsh reeds and generally avoid the voluminous summer boating traffic. Whereas deeper-draft boats have to pay attention to the charts, kayaks can wander all over the place in the shallow waters here. Another advantage of the lower Connecticut is that three-quarters of the 1-mile?wide mouth averages a few feet in depth, which serves to keep motorboats to a minimum or forces them into the west channel, which exits through two stone breakwaters beyond Saybrook Point Lighthouse. The water just off the breakwaters is also very shallow? even small boats sometimes get grounded. Great Island offers good summer sea kayaking amid marsh grass, seaside goldenrod, glasswort, sea lavender, and water hemp.&lt;br /&gt;This popular launch site, located less than 500 feet from the Great Island Wildlife Management Area, provides visitors with opportunities to explore tidal marshes and a barrier beach. It is important to note, however, that motorized vessels must remain a reasonable distance away from the Great Island Wildlife Management Area upon launching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; APX  95 (use whatever the gps indicates) Smith Neck Road&lt;br /&gt;Old Lyme, Connecticut for GPS users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from hartford:  Apx 45 minutes.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Take rte 9 south past Essex to 95 North , rte 9 ends here, stay to the left fork&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Take I-95 North to Exit 70.
