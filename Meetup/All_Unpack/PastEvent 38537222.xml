They are hosting FREE Faces of Hope event which is an one-hour breakfast with a heartfelt testimonial from a former Peque&amp;amp;ntilde;o whose life has been transformed through the work of Friends of the Orphans and Nuestros Peque&amp;amp;ntilde;os Hermanos (NPH, Spanish for &amp;#147;Our Little Brothers and Sisters&amp;#148;). There is an ASK but no minimum gift is expected. As much as anything, it is an opportunity to come and learn more about our organization! There is also a $100 Door Prize Gift Certificate to the Palm Restaurant in Boston!
