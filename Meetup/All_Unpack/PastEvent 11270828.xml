<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Award-winning British theater company, Punchdrunk, makes its US debut with Sleep No More, an immersive production inspired by Shakespeare's Macbeth, told through the lens of a Hitchcock thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extraordinary, unexpected location will be exquisitely transformed into an installation of cinematic scenes that evoke the world of Macbeth.  You, the audience, have the freedom to roam the environment and experience a sensory journey as you choose what to watch and where to go.  Rediscover the childlike excitement of exploring the unknown in this unique theatrical experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are available on the ART website: &lt;a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/sleep-no-more" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.americanre...&lt;/a&gt; -or- &lt;a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/sleep-no-more" target="_blank"&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All tickets are general admission, $39 (plus handling fee), with entries at 7.00pm, 7.20pm, and 7.40pm.  PLEASE PURCHASE A TICKET FOR THE 7.20pm ENTRY IN ORDER TO STAY WITH THE GROUP.  If tickets for the 7.20pm entry sell out, we will have to separate, but can meet up after the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet i&lt;b&gt;n front of the steps&lt;/b&gt; at the location (which is divulged when you purchase your ticket) at &lt;b&gt;7pm&lt;/b&gt;.  I will bring Meetup stickers so that we can identify fellow Nerds as we move through the performance area.  Please be on time, as they may try to urge us inside if they see us gathering.  We will resist, but resistance may be futile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to add comments/questions.  I will endeavor to answer them to the best of my ability.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Megan</member_name><member_id>10021028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257958325000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251917866000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sleep No More - Immersive Shakespeare</name><id>11270828</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255734000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11270828/</event_url></item>
