From there those who are interested can come to dinner and discuss the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guest speakers for this event are Marc Abrahams, The Annals of Improbable Research and The Ig Nobel Prizes, and chemist Daniel Rosenberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don?t miss the kick-off program of Season 6 of Science on Screen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alec Guinness delivers one of his most beloved performances in this smart satirical comedy that pits a mild-mannered but single minded inventor against the forces of Britain's textile industry. Sidney Stratton (Guinness) is a brilliant if under appreciated research chemist on a quest to bring progress to mankind by inventing a new kind of fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out. When he finally succeeds, he is hailed a genius. But both textile manufacturers and labor unions soon come to realize that his miracle cloth could destroy their industry, and resort to desperate measures to make sure his invention never gets to market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are Sidney Strattons everywhere?researchers and inventors who go to incredible lengths to pursue wild and often wonderful ideas, many of which the public never hears about. But guest speaker Marc Abrahams thinks we should know about the Strattons of the world and the challenges and pressures they face. In addition to being the co-founder and editor of the Annals of Improbable Research, a science humor magazine that showcases real research being done on strange or unexpected topics, Abrahams is the originator and emcee of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes, honoring unbelievable-but-true achievements that first make us laugh and then make us think. Those achievements include the development of a self-perfuming suit, which Abrahams will wear in honor of his Science on Screen appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abrahams will be joined by Harvard chemist Daniel Rosenberg, who will address a key question, especially for those of us prone to spillage: Is it possible to create clothing that never gets dirty and never wears out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but, 'That's funny...?&amp;quot; - Isaac Asimov&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science on Screen is supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, with additional support from Gesmer, Updegrove, LLP, and Richard Anders.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the alleyway where you line up to get in with a Blue LED Name Badge and a gaggle of NERDS</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt</member_name><member_id>6567601</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283880322000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283547946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Science On Screen: THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT @ the Coolidge</name><id>14649473</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283812200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14649473/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
