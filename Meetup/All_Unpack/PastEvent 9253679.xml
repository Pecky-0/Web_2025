Meet on Station Street outside of the Brookline Village T stop. There is 3 hr parking in the nearby Kent &amp;amp; Webster St municipal parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.emeraldnecklace.org/parks/riverway/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.emeraldnec...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the Riverway, marsh was turned into parkland. Olmsted rerouted the river, then carefully sculpted and planted the banks. These steep banks and wooded edges preserve a pastoral &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feeling, screening out what were once carriageways and are now busy roadways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Muddy River wends its way past internationally-known medical, cultural and educational institutions to the Charles River. This park contains a historic Bridal Path, once used by equestrians, several of Olmsted's famous trademark bridges, and a beautiful stone gazebo at the Chapel Street Bridge. It is the perfect alternative route to the crowded sidewalks along Brookline Avenue and the surrounding roads or just to come and relax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park Features: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gazebo at the Chapel Street Bridge &lt;br /&gt;Olmsted's stone bridges&lt;br /&gt;Bridal Path&lt;br /&gt;Walking/biking trails&lt;br /&gt;Open space for picnics&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are allowed on leash&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229560320000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228094117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Emerald Necklace walk</name><id>9253679</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229182200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9253679/</event_url></item>
