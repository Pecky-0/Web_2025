And there's nothing like a FREE tour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bunch of BBF guides who are also BPL guides, which means this tour will be just as awesome as anything BBF does outdoors.  Let's join them on a tour of a masterpiece of American architecture -- the wonderful Copley branch of the Boston Public Library. The tour will discuss the art and architecture of this edifice built by McKim, Mead and White. The BPL was built as a temple to learning and knowledge as well as a &amp;quot;palace of the people.&amp;quot; This hidden jewel of a tour includes: murals by John Singer Sargent and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes; marble lions; sculpture by Daniel Chester French; and a statue that was once 'Banned in Boston'. Best of all, as the front of the building says in stone it's &amp;quot;Free To All.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nerds have been asked to gather in the Boylston St. lobby.  Let's meet there around 2.45pm.  I will have BBF and Meetup stickers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the BOYLSTON St lobby.
