It will show 3 but that is because the Meetup website insists I count as 1 (one).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to some photos of Sunshine.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/633750/"&gt;Sunshine Photos&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be shooting 1 set outdoors at dusk and the remainder of the work will be in the studio.  There will be about 4 sets and wardrobe changes in a 3-4 hour period.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is open to experienced photographers. You should know how to use and control your camera, including F-stop, aperture, ISO, Manual setting, white balance, etc.  Even though there will be only 2 photographers, the nature of then event will not allow me time to help with these things.  Thanks for your understanding.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are available and have been itching to work in this type of setting then this shoot is for you.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Your Paypal payment must be received within 24-hours of your RSVP or your RSVP will be automatically canceled.   Sorry about the draconian rules but as there are only 2 guests I really can't afford a no-show situation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Take elevator to 3rd floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jerry</member_name><member_id>9244453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1248033057000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Studio Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greater-Boston-Studio-Photography</urlname><id>1454286</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2799987793</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Studio &amp; Glamour Photography</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244569668000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intimate Night with Sunshine</name><id>10613358</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245279600000</time><rsvp_limit>3</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Photography/events/10613358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/7/global_8635127.jpeg</photo_url></item>
