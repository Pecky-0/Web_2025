All levels of climbers are welcome.  Please bring harness, helmet and climbing shoes as well as water and snacks.  If you have rope and gear for top rope set up please bring those as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Lopa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Everybody, I will be there with a Red Osprey Atmos Backpack at 1100. I should have one or two ropes set up by then. I would appreciate if people brought their ropes. The more climbs the merrier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ir rains, I will head to Metrorock instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pete&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Pete will update the details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pete</member_name><member_id>4925014</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214960517000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214316594000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Top Roping  at Quincy Quarries</name><id>8204182</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214665200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8204182/</event_url></item>
