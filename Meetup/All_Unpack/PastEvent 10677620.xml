We will walk about 0.5 miles &lt;br /&gt;as a group to picnic and enjoy the bands, pops concert, and air force fly over at Derby Park &lt;br /&gt;by the harbor, culminating with beautiful fireworks.  Dinner can be purchased in Salem or &lt;br /&gt;brought from home.  After the fireworks (about 9:45), there will be an optional Salem ferry ride &lt;br /&gt;back to Boston (the ferry is 2 blocks from Derby Park).  Last year, the ferry ride was spectacular! &lt;br /&gt;and we witnessed the entire coastline's array of fireworks (including Boston's grand finale!).  If &lt;br /&gt;you are planning on taking the ferry back to Boston (Salem is accessible via MBTA Commuter &lt;br /&gt;Rail for your trip *to* Salem), you should purchase a ticket as soon as possible; this option will &lt;br /&gt;fill up fast.  &lt;br /&gt;Trip's Coordinator: Mosaicwalks@yahoo.com &lt;br /&gt;RSVP REQUIRED (include a phone number and email address) for this trip as there are many &lt;br /&gt;options and details.  Contact the TC by email, before July 3rd.  Drizzle cancels. &lt;br /&gt;MEET: We will meet outside by the fountain in front of the Peabody Essex Museum at 4pm.  &lt;br /&gt;COST: Return ferry cost is $13 +$5 non-members.  Consult www.mbta.com for schedule and &lt;br /&gt;pricing for commuter rail service to Salem and salemferry.com for information on the Ferry.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP to Mosaicwalks@yahoo.com for more details.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David</member_name><member_id>4431256</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247406530000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends and members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>mosaicofmass</urlname><id>416725</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Mosaic Jewish Outdoor Club of Massachusetts</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245293267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDEPENDENCE DAY SPECTACULAR IN SALEM</name><id>10677620</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246737600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mosaicofmass/events/10677620/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/0/global_1883520.jpeg</photo_url></item>
