For help, we suggest Peter Singer's Hegel: A Very Short Introduction. Harder going, but perhaps more rewarding, is Alexandre Koj√®ve's Introduction to the Reading of Hegel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, Hegel has his own terminology, which he usually fails to define. But have no fear. Simply Google &amp;quot;Hegel Glossary&amp;quot; and choose one or several, and if you can't find a term in your first choice check some others, but keep in mind that none are Hegel defining Hegel, unless they quote him directly. M. Inwood's A Hegel Dictionary, 356 pages, ISBN-13: 9780631175339, might be worth acquiring.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276857775000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276520954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hegel: Phenomenology of Spirit VI</name><id>13794332</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276815600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/13794332/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/8/global_13192184.jpeg</photo_url></item>
