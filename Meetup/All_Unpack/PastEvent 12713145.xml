What dreams have you had that made you smile or giggle or even laugh out loud? What dreams tickled your funny bone? What dreams were fun or playful? What dreams surprised you or shocked you or turned your world upside down? What dreams or dream characters tricked you or fooled you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month there will be no lecture, only dream sharing. Come share your dreams. Any dream you want to share will be welcome. It need not be funny. Anyone who wants to share a dream, may do so. We will divide up the time so each dream-sharer may have equal time to share and receive feedback if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular dream sharing helps to improve dream recall and dream skills, as well as helping to improve emotional well being, physical health, and spiritual development. It's also a lot of fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting will be facilitated by Deerheart. He is a visionary artist, a spiritual advisor, a practicing shaman, and a dream guide. An experienced explorer of the dream realms, he has researched and studied many books and studied under many teachers. For more information about him, visit his website, &lt;a href="http://www.visionarydreamguide.com" target="_blank"&gt;Visionary Dream Guide&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payment is $10 and can be made online or in person. Anyone who cannot afford to pay is welcome to attend and should contact the group organizer &lt;a href="http://www.bostondreamers.com/suggestion/" target="_blank"&gt;Deerheart&lt;/a&gt; before attending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event will be from 7 pm until 9 pm.
