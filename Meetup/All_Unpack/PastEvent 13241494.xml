Hopefully it'll return soon and we can re-post it.  Instead, I'm posting the movie &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;City Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  It was the winner of the Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award.  I saw a couple of reviews and they seem pretty good.  (Thanks for the suggestion, John).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;City Island&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a quaint fishing community on the outskirts of New York City, City Island is a hilarious and touching tale about a family whose comfortable co-existence is upended by surprising revelations of past secrets and present day lies. Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) is a lifelong resident of the tiny, tradition-steeped Bronx enclave of City Island. A family man who makes his living as a corrections officer, Vince longs to become an actor. Ashamed to admit his aspirations to his family, Vince would rather let his fiery wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) believe his weekly poker games are a cover for an extramarital affair than admit heâ€™s secretly taking acting classes in Manhattan. A perfect storm of deception, half truths and confusion makes Vince and his family members realize that the truth may not set them free, but it is easier to keep track of than all their well-intentioned white lies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Andy Garcia, Julianna Margulies, Emily Mortimer, Alan Arkin, Steven Strait &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cityislandmovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cityislandmovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cityisland...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet in the lobby around 6:30.
