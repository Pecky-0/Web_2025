Located at the green-design house situated on in the middle of the Morse Mountain Sanctuary in Phippsburg, Maine, we offer the space to join other mindful folks in a weekend of shared events with enough personal time to do your own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few years we have used a semi-structured format, with an "invitation" format to allow participants to offer their own mindful activity. Current potential activities include silent meditation, yoga, guided outdoor mindful activity, mindful moving night, guided meditation, etc., and there is always a variety of events to partake in and enjoy with others in this peaceful and awe-inspiring setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come join us for a weekend you will be sure to remember for years to come! Room/bed for Friday and Saturday night, as well as Saturday night dinner included in $85 fee. You bring your own food for Friday evening, and breakfasts and lunches. The house includes four bedrooms (you'll have to share a room) and two rustic cabins that are extra private. First come, first serve for space. Much more details to come, feel free to email me if you have questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Directions and details to follow</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336343154000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333503730000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Morse Mountain Mindfulness Weekend</name><id>59160882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336165200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/59160882/</event_url></item>
