Realize this is a bit different from our typical adventures, but part of our credence is exploring new places and things and this definitely fits the bill for me.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the description listed on the BSO website:  &lt;a href="http://www.bso.org/bso/mods/c_09_gen_images.jsp?id=30500011" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bso.org/bs...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Folk and pop music are reinvented on the Pops stage in this special performance by the unmistakable original voice behind the band 10,000 Maniacs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Featuring her lyrical vocals, this Pops presentation showcases Natalie Merchant's extraordinary solo career - the singing, songwriting, and producing expertise that has earned her the marks of a true musical innovator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Natalie Merchant began her recording career as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the pop music band 10,000 Maniacs. Her voice and outspoken social awareness cemented her status as one of today?s most astute and captivating artists with a reputation as a songwriter and singer of quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;EdgeFest Caf√©&lt;br /&gt;After each EdgeFest concert, hear the best of today's emerging talent.
