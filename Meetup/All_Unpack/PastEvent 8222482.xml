We'll be there until after 1pm, so stop by anytime.  We'll have SoJust signs so you can find us.  We'll be the gaggle of folks having fun and wearing nametags!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further if you're seeking like-minded folks to share a beach blanket with, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while splashing around in the water, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to connect outside of SoJust events? Members can view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, etc. on the 'Message Board' and are encouraged to suggest and co-host events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;Event Photos&lt;/a&gt;.
