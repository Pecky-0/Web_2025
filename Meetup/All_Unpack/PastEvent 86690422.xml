A good time was had by all the last time we went there. There are some stairs, so this restaurant is not handicapped accessible. There is a bathroom but it is not handicapped accessible on our level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The address is 107R Union Street. There is parking in the center of the square. Cut through the bank driveway and go through the gate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy B.</member_name><member_id>11339653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352689388000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350057316000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at Union Street Restaurant</name><id>86690422</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352649600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/86690422/</event_url></item>
