See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge Brewing Co. was too loud (as some of you had warned) so for now I've set us up for Tommy Doyle's, which is right next door.  Unfortunately, Tommy's has karaoke on Thursday nights (I haven't been able to figure out when it starts) which could be an even worse problem.  Options are to switch the meetup to a different night, have it earlier in the evening or find another place.  Please voice your opinion in the message board thread that I've started.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>paula</member_name><member_id>2017958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235006957000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Transhumanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>transhumanism-72</urlname><id>216208</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Transhumanists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229650640000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Transhumanists January Meetup -- NEW NIGHT</name><id>9361215</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231979400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/transhumanism-72/events/9361215/</event_url></item>
