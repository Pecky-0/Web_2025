 &lt;a href="http://www.svlt.org/Trails/TractMap.asp?TownName=Amherst&amp;amp;TractName=Joe%20English%20Reservation"&gt;http://www.svlt.org/Trails/TractMap.asp?Tow...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The Joe English Reservation is comprised of 558 acres, as of 2000, and is the largest and best known conservation property in Amherst. It is composed of a number of acquisitions and it continues to be expanded. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 An extensive color coded trail system opens the complex to hiking and to cross-country skiing and showshoeing in the winter. Trails are marked with signs and sign posts which were added in 2000. The main accesses are (1) at the north end of Brook Road at Peabody Mill Environmental Center, and (2) 3/4 mile up Chestnut Hill Road on the left. Each parking area has some parking spaces. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This is a rolling wooded tract with both deciduous and evergreen trees. Several brooks and ponds are located throughout the area. Wildlife consists of beaver and usual pond denizens, migratory waterfowl, and resident birds of pond and forest, small mammals, moose and deer. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be doing a 4 mile hike that starts at the pond, #26, then goes to intersection #27, onto the Pine Trail to #11, along the High Land Trail to #12, along the Ledge Trail to #10, then follows all of the Bacon Trail passing intersections #22 and #21 and ending at #9 to take the Ledge Trail to #7 where we take the Old Brook Rd. Trail to #8. Continuing on the Timber Trail to #5, continuing on the Eagle Trail to #4, continuing on the Hammond Brook Trail all the way back to the parking lot while passing intersections #3, #2, and #1. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 There will be many spots of going uphill and downhill but the elevation gain or loss ranges in between 325 - 525 feet of elevation (200 feet of elevation gain or loss)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a few places along the way anyone getting tired can take a short cut back to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hunting season the only thing to be concerned with is deer can be hunted by archery on this date and hunting is allowed on Joe English in case you want yellow or orange on you or your dog. &lt;br /&gt;
