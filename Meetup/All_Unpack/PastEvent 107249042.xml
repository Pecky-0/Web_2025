&lt;p&gt;Mr. DeWitt will discuss the Clergy Project and the story of his journey from religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jerry DeWitt was a pastor in the town of DeRidder, Louisiana, and a fixture of the community. He had begun to question his Pentecostal faith, however, and late one night in 2011, a member of his flock called seeking prayer for her brother who had been in a serious accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DeWitt searched for the right words to console her, speech failed him, and he found that the faith which had once formed the cornerstone of his life finally crumbled to dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When DeWitt was eventually outed as an atheist, he found himself shunned by much of DeRidder’s highly religious community, losing his job, his wife, and nearly everything he’d known. He has since become a leader and well-known speaker in America’s fast-growing atheist movement." -from the Hope After Faith website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As always, we will be setting up around 6:30, so feel free to come and socialize. The program is scheduled to start at 7. We ask that non members make a small $5 donation at the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
