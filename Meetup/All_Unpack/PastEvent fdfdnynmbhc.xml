Our Puggies can relax in the yard and maybe go for a walk again finally! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The August Meetup was another success..saw some wonderful old freinds and made a lot of new ones too! Also thank to everyone for helping us reach our goal to collect enough money to donate 2 more event banners for Curly Tail Pug Rescue. Please continue to visit their website to support this wonderful organization. www.curlytailpugrescue.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don't forget one the the big announcements we made about the Pet Rock Festival Sunday September 12 Noon to 5pm. Here is a link and the second link is for a $2 off coupon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.petrockfest.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.petrockfes...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.petrockfest.com/images/stories/coupon/pet_rock_coupon.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.petrockfes...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I will be away attending Pet Appreciation weekend for CASAS Animal Shelter in Ptown Cape Cod, but our Assistant Organizers Julie and crew will be sure to show ya'll a wonderful time at the September Meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the biggest event for all of us Puggy lovers is coming up to benefit the Pug Rescue of New England. The Annual Pug Social! This is their huge annual event folks that you are NOT going to want to miss. Hundreds of pugs, vendors, games, races, costume contests and more. Sunday October 10th at the Spencer Fair Grounds Noon to 4pm! We will get together as a group again and all wear YELLOW shirts this year to advertise our Pug Meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pugrescueofnewengland.org/new_site/2010socialflyer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pugrescueo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I truly enjoy being the Organizers of the Grafton pug Meetup. We hope that we have met each of you individually, and if we have not, please come up and introduce yourself at the next one. We are constantly trying to come up with new treats for our precious pugs, and ideas to keep it informative and interesting. We welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and play in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;b&gt;this is a PUG Meetup&lt;/b&gt;...as not all breeds play well together.  There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the Meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/b&gt; to cover Meetup costs and any leftover money will be donated to the Curly Tail Pug Rescue as well as other animal related charity that we all agree on as a group. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues, snacks and to keep this website going so we can all see when the next Meetup is taking place.  We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will introduce ourselves...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erin maguire</member_name><member_id>3828727</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth Mott</member_name><member_id>6811754</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>10300396</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285445893000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283258902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>fdfdnynmbhc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285434000000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/14602601/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/b/global_10981051.jpeg</photo_url></item>
