This is a good inexpensive alternative to going into Boston on a Saturday night.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Chicken Wings?  This is definately the place for you then!  They also have other fantabulous stuff on their menu!  Im thinking we can grab a group of tables order some food/drinks and then sit/stand/mosh  to the cover band at 9 until whenever.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the site and RSVP because this will be a chill time!      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a pretty relaxed meet up - I'll even allow Maybe's (I know don't faint).  I'll send out a reminder email ahead of time but no formal RSVP's will be requested by me (again don't faint) &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace out ch'all!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll intially meet by the entrance but if you're running late call my cell phone and I'll let you know where we are</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203529943000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><why>Why Not?</why><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201929253000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buck Naykid at The Chicken Bone </name><id>7245739</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202603400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/7245739/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/2/global_2186386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
