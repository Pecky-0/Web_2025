This may be a great option! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julio's in Westboro always has some great wine and beer tastings - ALL FREE! They always draw quite a crowd.  I  have never been disappointed!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, today's event : 90+Cellars Wine Tasting paired up with  the owner of BLUE RIBBON BBQ will be serving tasty ribs and brisket and selling their award winning Carolina BBQ sauce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tasting runs from 1:00 - 3pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;****NOTE: I will be away and unable to attend &lt;/b&gt; Just thought I would post as &lt;br /&gt;they always have wonderful tastings.&lt;b&gt;FYI: &lt;/b&gt; What they usually do for an event this size is &lt;br /&gt;ask everyone  for IDs , then give you a wristband. Be there earley enough - huge store, although there may be lines.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248144528000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247695630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE-  " 90+Cellars " Wine Tasting &amp; Blue Ribbon BBQ Sliders </name><id>10885302</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247936400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/10885302/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/1/global_4253025.jpeg</photo_url></item>
