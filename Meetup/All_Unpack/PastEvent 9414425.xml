And you are more than welcome to bring guests, family members or motorcycling enthusiasts - All are Welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any members want to chime in with vocals and or play an instrument themselves, whether a 6 string guitar, drums, horn or otherwise - let me know, you're more than welcome to showcase your hidden talents, so the opportunity is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maximum cost is $15 per person which will cover the buffett and the live music.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the Back Room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235919840000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230746159000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2 Wheel Winter Wonderland party</name><id>9414425</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235349900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/9414425/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/9/a/global_6779786.jpeg</photo_url></item>
