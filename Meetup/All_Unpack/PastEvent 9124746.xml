Sing-a-long music is provided for a festive spirit and wagon sides keep everyone safe and cozy. Cost $5.00 per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have two campfire amphitheaters, each having seating for over 100. Long-handled safety forks with marshmallows are provided for a favorite toasted treat. One of the campfire sites has a raised stage area that provides a focal point for song leaders! The Campfire can also be scheduled for $1/pp or minimum of $25 per hour. Please add your comments with your YES REPLY if you'd like the campfire too (which is after the Hayride). Campfires are scheduled by Appointment Only.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet @ Main Entrance.
