<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll take a closer look at actual entry/exit points and how the chart can help to identify them. We'll also look at some of the elements that go into planning the entry point (bases, patterns, and other technicals as supported by IBD). &lt;br /&gt;I would ask each member to bring questions regarding a favorite stock from their own watchlists for a group critique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a lively meeting!
