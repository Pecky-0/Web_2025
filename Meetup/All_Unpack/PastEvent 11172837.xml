If you happen to come after we already hit the walls, please find me climbing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just look out for curly hair and an interesting sounding accent.  ;o)&lt;br /&gt;Or simply ask at the front desk for Lilly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:  You will have to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. &lt;br /&gt;If you have never climbed before, you have to take a class at Rock Spot. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class.
