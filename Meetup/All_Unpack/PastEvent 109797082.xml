I'm sure our pugs will love that idea! We will be grilling up some hamburgers and hotdogs...veggie burgers and veggie dogs too.... You can bring a dish or a snack if you would like ..we will also provide coffee,soda and i'm sure a special over 21+ drink.. and because we have so many new faces we will be updating the meetup photo for the page....i will also be having a summer costume contest for the pups so if you have some summer digs for your pup bring them along : ) The categories will be best summer t shirt , best doggie bathing suit, and best summer outfit... This should be a good time and a nice way to welcome summer in...  Just added we will be holding a few raffles to benefit green mountain pug rescue  with 100% of all proceeds going to green mountain pug rescue...so bring a few bucks with you if you can and you may even win a prize!  I will be selling raffles tickets for $1 a piece&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jessica</member_name><member_id>12173270</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368903776000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363610557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>kick off to summer party! </name><id>109797082</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368892800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/109797082/</event_url></item>
