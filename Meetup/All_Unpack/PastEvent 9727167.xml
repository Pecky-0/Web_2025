Dinner for those interested (mention in RSVP).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from stubhub:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Beck Tickets â€” Guitar God&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't tell Jeff Beck he's the best rock guitarist of all time, because he's too modest to go in for those kinds of titles, even if it is close to the truth. An integral part of one of rock's most seminal bands, the Yardbirds, and an accomplished solo musician, Beck is one of the most versatile, talented guitarists of all time. Be blown away by his virtuosity when you see him in concert! A live album is due in 2006.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg D</member_name><member_id>4879355</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240019933000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234440498000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jeff Beck </name><id>9727167</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239661800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/9727167/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/4/a/global_7282426.jpeg</photo_url></item>
