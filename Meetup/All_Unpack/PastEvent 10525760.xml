I know the show is at 10:00 on a Thursday, but what a great way to kick off the weekend! Listen to some great storytellers, have a lovely beverage and maybe even toss your own hat in the ring to tell your story. For those of you who don't want to see the show, there is a plan in the works for a meetup the following Thursday for just talking storytelling. I would definitely suggest seeing the show though (and not just because I run it)! It is laid back and a good time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(brief warning this month's show is stories about coming out in honor of the old Boston Pride week so if that makes you nervous then you should definitely come see the show and you will leave with some new gay friends..and won't that be great?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jess&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am the host!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>7409085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246587997000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>storytellers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>storytelling-28</urlname><id>1247871</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Greater Boston and MA Storytelling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243634693000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Night of Oral (tradition)</name><id>10525760</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244167200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/storytelling-28/events/10525760/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/e/global_5060862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
