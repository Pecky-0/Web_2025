This event would be a perfect occassion for us to meet up and get to know each other a little better and the best part is that it is free. However they are only having this from 12 - 3 p.m. and would like to hear your suggestions for a good time. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172512971000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172279263000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newport Winter Festival 2007</name><id>5508802</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172340000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/5508802/</event_url></item>
