Well, why don't you join us this upcoming Saturday for a barbecue, fishing, swimming, frisbee, or anything else you would like to do over at Cochituate State Park, just a bit west of Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swimming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring a bathing suit for swimming, and there are bathrooms at the park as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested in fishing or learning how to fish, let me know.  I will also bring two extra fishing rods, and should have enough gear to keep you happy.  I don't have any live bait, so feel free to bring your own if you want.  Also, if you don't have a Massachusetts fishing license, you can purchase a 3-day license for $7.50 from this website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sport.state.ma.us/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sport.stat...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Volunteering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will need everyone to cooperate a bit in getting together food, drinks, and other lunch items.  Everyone should bring something to for themselves to eat and/or barbecue, but I also need some volunteers to bring the following items:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paper Plates: Rob S.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic Fork, Knives: maybe Rob S.
