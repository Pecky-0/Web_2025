There's plenty of fun things to do in town. . . like joining us for a somewhat impromptu, last-minute dinner at this neighborhood gem in East Arlington. And eating at a restaurant that is essentially a one-of-a-kind, one-woman show seemed the perfect follow-up to our recent viewing of &amp;quot;Julie and Julia.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prose's chef-owner Debbie Shore is creative, inspired, and totally unpredictable so we never have any idea what to expect when we go there. . . but we know it will be incredibly good. And it will probably be locally grown/farmed/raised. And there won't be a huge wine list but what is there will be carefully chosen to bring out the best in each item on the menu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight warning: this is a restaurant for people who care more about good food and good company than they do about good service. When you are dealing with a one-person-show, you sort of have to go with the experience and not expect waitpersons to anticipate your every wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, no Maybe RSVPs. . . not enough time for them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, your $2 reservation fee will be added to the tip for our table.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation is in my name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256166089000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251763878000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End-of-summer dinner at Prose, Arlington</name><id>11252160</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252103400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/11252160/</event_url></item>
