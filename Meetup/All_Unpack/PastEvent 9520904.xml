And while they speak, audiences can't help but mull the same question: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave--&amp;quot;Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams&amp;quot;--wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because &amp;quot;time is all you have...and you may find one day that you have less than you think&amp;quot;). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humor, inspiration and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to &lt;br /&gt;come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Come and enjoy reading and talking about books with us, whether you've read all the book, some of the book, or just thought a lot about trying to get around to reading the book.  All are welcome to the table.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have a copy of the book out on the table, near the front of Panera.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meagan</member_name><member_id>6521348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1239035665000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231941576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Book Discussion - The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch</name><id>9520904</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237933800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/9520904/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/c/global_7375740.jpeg</photo_url></item>
