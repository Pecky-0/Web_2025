Definitely &lt;br /&gt;profound healing and life-changing experience that lasts, and &lt;br /&gt;many effects of which are permanent. Plus, everything you learn &lt;br /&gt;there you'll be able to extend to those around you. And, I'm also&lt;br /&gt;speaking from personal experience: benefits for myself from&lt;br /&gt;these events were / are huge, in a very short time and on all levels, &lt;br /&gt;physical, psychological, spiritual, clarity and 'can do' approach, and &lt;br /&gt;essentially seeing own life changing in the most amazing ways. &lt;br /&gt;Elena&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soulful Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the going gets tough... the tough go within.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successful, purposeful work.
