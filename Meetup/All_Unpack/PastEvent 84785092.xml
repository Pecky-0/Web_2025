<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Well it's that time of year, and the leaves should be fantastic next weekend. We can fit 6 people (plus me) in my van comfortably and take a nice day trip up to Vermont to scope out the scenery, see country stores, rivers or lakes or waterfalls, and make a nice day of it! For those who don't live close, I will also pick people up in Manchester.  Contact me to let me know where you'd like to start!  If alot of people want to join, there's one other volunteer, (so far) so we can follow each other in two (or more) cars. Find a nice place to have lunch there too, and depending on timing, come back to my house for dinner or playing games too! This meetup will be subject to weather though, so be sure to check back in later in the week...  Likely Monday will be the rain date as forecast is ok for that day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes my email through this site doesn't work, so email me from your email at &lt;a href="mailto:mauimarion@yahoo.com"&gt;mauimarion@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room for just 1 more!!!  Call early am Monday before 7:30  860-477-0335&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If Manchester is an easier meetup spot, let me know.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marion buteau</member_name><member_id>12445225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349806252000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349018745000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drive to Vermont Columbus day.
