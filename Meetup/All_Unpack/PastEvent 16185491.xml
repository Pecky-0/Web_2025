Here's a great video on fractals with Arthur C. Clarke I'd just seen for the first time.  &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8570098277666323857#" target="_blank"&gt;google video link&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If no one else happens to be willing and able ( Please: Let me know if you're interested in sharing in that way and you're up either this meeting or the next )  I volunteer such a look into what I'm doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it will be useful to see, as a group, into how one of us is working on some particulars and for the rest of us to offer thoughts a problem or two plaguing the presenter, should that be the case.    It will also serve as a vehicle for an orienting look into the Apple environment including xCode and Interface Builder for those who've not taken the plunge but are curious to see it in action.    Beginners and potential migrants to iOS are most welcome.   &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt; continuing the discussion we'd been having about plans for future meetings whereat we collaborate on building something useful from the ground up over multiple sessions.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can make it,&lt;br /&gt;Brian &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.   It was a connection made with help of the Maine Center for Creativity, who also provided help in funding this meetup brand group.   So thanks to Jean Maginnis and Raphael Diluzio of that organization, known for their &amp;quot;Pecha Kucha Nights&amp;quot; and other initiatives.
