<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the new Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate that will alternate in exposing our children to the Mandarin and Cantonese Languages.  It is co-hosted (experimentally for now) by MJ who is a native and fluent speaker in both Mandarin and Cantonese.  And I help provide the informal educational components in the form of a short group activity appropriate for all ages to promote the learning and use of the languages.  We strive to make Mandarin and Cantonese accessible to all levels!  So don't be shy!  We can all learn together with our kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week, we will have story-time in Mandarin.&lt;/strong&gt; We will start this around 10:45am.  The activity this week will be &lt;em&gt;a &lt;span style="color : #666699"&gt;Sticker &amp;amp; Stamped Christmas Cards for Chinese Grandparents*&lt;/span&gt;! Chinese characters stickers &amp;amp; preprinted card insides.&lt;/em&gt; Very easy to do for tots and even easier for Moms of infants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #666699"&gt;*This craft will be $5 per family.  I've got some beautiful "Jolie" brand 3D stickers and just bought some new Christmas themed stamps and ink pads.  I will also provide the cards/envelops and Chinese Character Stickers. If you want me to scan the finished card so you can print additional cards with the same design, I can send you the file for free or print some for $1 per 2 cards.  The replica cards will be blank inside.  Thanks for understanding!  (You are not obligated to partake in the craft.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids can always free-play as desired.  If you have DVDs to share or information on links to videos in Chinese that are appropriate for babies and young toddlers to view, please bring them to share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breastfeeding-friendly environment!  Bring your baby's bottle/fomula or your tots lunch if you want to stay for lunch together. (And your own lunch too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check back often before we meet!  I will update the activity once it's been decided. And I may change our location from time to time either for variety, a field-trip or just because another member would like a chance to co-host at their home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also download and print the parking permit for parking on my street.  It is posted on my street and all the neighboring streets that there is no parking.  However, residents may temporarily grant parking to friends/family -- with a parking badge or permit that will distinguish you from just anyone!  Please place on dash, easily seen, to avoid a parking ticket.  And fit into my driveway first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you RSVP, I assume you're coming with your child!  If you have 2 kids or more, please add them to your RSVP so I know how many kids will be participating.  Thanks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
