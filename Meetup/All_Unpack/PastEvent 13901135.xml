I will have a balloon so people wanting to go later can find us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Othello, is considered one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should you bring to the free performance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a minimum, bring a blanket to sit on. The elevated, well-lit stage is at the bottom of a gentle slope, so you should be able to see well from wherever you're sitting.  Some people also bring low folding chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area closest to the stage begins to fill up about 2 hours before the performance.  However, the lighting and sound systems make it easy for you to see and hear what's going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people bring picnic dinners, and along with something cold and refreshing to drink.  But if you don't have time to pack a dinner, don't worry.  Food vendors typically hail from some of Boston's favorite eateries, such as Upper Crust, Figaro's, and Ben and Jerry's. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in front of CVS on Summer Street-across from Macys</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lelia</member_name><member_id>4161738</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281151767000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277408888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shakespeare on the Common:  Othello</name><id>13901135</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281132900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/13901135/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/d/global_8294813.jpeg</photo_url></item>
