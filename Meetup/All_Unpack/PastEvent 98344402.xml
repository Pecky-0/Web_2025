&lt;p&gt;I heard the music last weekend was awesome, with a nice mix of oldies and top forties.  Let's go boogie, esp. because my birthday falls on Monday and I can't celebrate it with you all on a weekday ;(  ah...49 again!!  you're as young as you feel, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noel, Ken and I are hosting this and I will try and introduce you to the group, if you wish, if you get there early enough, otherwise you'll find me on the dance floor!  Grab me if you'd like to be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Castleton is a nice venue, and Fred does a nice job getting us all "Together" and although together is a "singles" function, many couples attend and have a great time as well.  I never discourage couples from attending, after all...some have met at the singles dances...lol.  And that's the whole idea...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a ballroom setting, with plenty of space for dancing and swinging, and the dress co&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/7/2/event_193883922.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;de is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no jeans or shorts, sneakers or work boots, let's keep it classy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancing begins at 8pm, and the cost is $12 before 9pm and $15 after 9pm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Fred for getting that music mixed up, and for helping me get my "Groove on".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you on the dance floor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; PS...in memory of Richard...you'll see him in this pic (sure do miss him twirling me), along with Noel (always smiling) and I think Donna is the one with the arm in the air...&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meetup signs on the tables...ask at the door where meetup is sitting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358129316000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>fun folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dance-342</urlname><id>462174</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>41</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357565848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Together dance at the Castleton</name><id>98344402</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358038800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/events/98344402/</event_url></item>
