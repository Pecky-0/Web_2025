<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For more than 20 years the Boston Beanstalks have gathered on the first Friday night of the month at the Riverbend Lounge (formerly the Windjammer) at the Newton Marriott. This is the biggest regularly scheduled event on our calendar. It's not uncommon to see 40 or more tall people here, and you won't be the only new or prospective member! This is the place to start your social calendar planning, arrange carpooling for various events, and find out what's going on with all your Tall friends.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's enough interest, we'll head into the restaurant around 8:00 PM to continue the conversation and get something to eat.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Marriott Hotel, 2345 Commonwealth Avenue (Rt. 30) in Newton   &lt;br /&gt;Time: 6-8 PM, usually dinner afterwards to 10pm   &lt;br /&gt;Cost: optional drinks   &lt;br /&gt;Directions: Rt. 128 to exit 24 (Rt. 30). At the end of the ramp, go right. The Marriott is just ahead on your left.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/BOSNT" target="_blank"&gt;More on the Newton Marriott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remodeling Update:&lt;/b&gt;  The last couple of months the Marriott has been remodeling, including the Riverbend Lounge.  Last month we were told there's a good chance it'll be done by our May First Friday.  If it's not, we'll be near the temporary bar at the back of the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a group of tall people at the bar in the Riverbend or ask the bartender</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elaine</member_name><member_id>2416024</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>FLUFFY852</member_name><member_id>4490497</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan Huffman</member_name><member_id>4517619</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sylvia</member_name><member_id>4519074</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marie A</member_name><member_id>4623326</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>5213351</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeanne Smith</member_name><member_id>8341850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273462958000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271720202000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club Monthly Meetup</name><id>dggdnynhbkb</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273269600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/13230488/</event_url></item>
