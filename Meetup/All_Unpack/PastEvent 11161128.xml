We'll be going over some things on dry land first, then hit the water to practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You either must have a kayak with bulkheads, or if your kayak does not have bulkheads then it must have some flotation in the back - beach ball, dry bag, or a real float back.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things to bring: Boat paddle and PFD obviously. Dress for the water and bring a towel and a warm change of clothes. Other stuff it would be good to have include: paddle float (for self rescue), Pump, spray skirt.  I also highly recommend nose plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we'll be pushing sunset, lights are also required for this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LOCATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link that shows the reservoir map  -  &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/ashland.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that we are NOT entering through the state park entrance.  The launch is at the bottom of the water on Spring St.  If you take 135 to Clinton St to Olive St to Spring St (see map of area), it is very easy to find, just note that when you are on Spring St and it looks like you are about to drive through a gravel company, it's ok, you're in the right place, just keep going straight on the road, and the launch is not far after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out those links for the directions, we'll be meeting at the boat launch at the south end of the water.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251638290000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250811436000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rescues practice at Ashland Reservoir</name><id>11161128</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251150300000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/11161128/</event_url></item>
