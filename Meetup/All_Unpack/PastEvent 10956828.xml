<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our First Annual Pug Meetup Cookout in July was a HUGE success! Thank you all soooo much for joining us and making such wonderful edible contributions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here we are in the hottest month of the year! Come join us in the air conditioned indoor play room at Gibson Kennels for an hour of romping playing fun for our puggies! Nothing special planned for this meetup, just some good old fashioned fun of old and new friends getting together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I truly enjoy being the Organizers of the Grafton pug Meetup. We hope that we have met each of you individually, and if we have not, please come up and introduce yourself at the next one. We are constantly trying to come up with new treats for our precious pugs, and ideas to keep it informative and interesting. We welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and play in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;b&gt;this is a PUG Meetup&lt;/b&gt;...as not all breeds play well together.  There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the Meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/b&gt; to cover Meetup costs and any leftover money will be donated to the Curly Tail Pug Rescue as well as other animal related charity that we all agree on as a group. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues, snacks and to keep this website going so we can all see when the next Meetup is taking place.  We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will introduce ourselves...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erin maguire</member_name><member_id>3828727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253987339000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248555946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug August Meetup</name><id>10956828</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251565200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/10956828/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/a/global_8419338.jpeg</photo_url></item>
