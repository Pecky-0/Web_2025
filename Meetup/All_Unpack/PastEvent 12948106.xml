Let's try Wed the 31st at 6:30pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walk is 4.5 miles, but there are T and Bus lines along the way if you want to duck out early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=117398343489237033278.000481c4d5e0a7db2d6ea&amp;amp;ll=42.338435,-71.15098&amp;amp;spn=0.014814,0.027938&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the proposed map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Dunks, as usual.  It should be east to find a parking spot in the area, and you can take the C (Cleveland Circle) or D (Reservoir) Green lines.   There are a few places to eat if people want to do dinner during or after the walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try to arrive at 6:30&lt;/b&gt;, but you are welcome to join the walk late, just call or text me to find out where we are.  I try not to wait too long, so if you're going to be late, please call or text me close to 6:30.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Green jacket, blue jeans, constantly looking around for meetup people.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270247712000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269199472000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brighton 4.5mi. - Reservoir, Chestnut Hill Ave, &amp; Washington St.</name><id>12948106</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270074600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/12948106/</event_url></item>
