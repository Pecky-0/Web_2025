Let's meetup to compare notes on what we have seen/ want to see and perhaps go to one of the program items together.  I may get there earlier but would like to meet at 4:45pm (allowing some time to choose on an event if we decide to attend one at 5pm).  I'll plan to hang out in the lobby to meet anyone else who's there.  My number is 617-595-1855, give me a call if your trying to find me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you will see on the &lt;a href="http://www.readercon.org/docs/RC21ProgramGrid.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Readercon Pocket Schedule&lt;/a&gt; there is a lot going on Friday night.
