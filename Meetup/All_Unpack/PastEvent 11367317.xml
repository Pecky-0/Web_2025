Instead, we will have brunch at Doyle's in JP.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us on a stroll around the kettlepond. We can espy avians, uncover newts, debate the ethics of feeding the geese, and enjoy the autumn splendor. Bring your binoculars and your identification guides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any biologists in the crowd, please make it known if you'd be willing to help curate the walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the JP Licks on Centre Street in JP, which can be easily reached by bus or train. Car-drivers will find parking on the street and in nearby public lots. Early arrivers can grab a sundae or a coffee, depending on their predelictions. When we're all together, we'll walk the few blocks north to the water, and commence our natural philosophizing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If afterwards we want to grab food as a group or in smaller clusters of nature-loving heathens, Centre Street is studded with popular options. Let us keep an open mind and play it by ear, as regards brunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For questions, please call: 617-935-4951.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256249423000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252937094000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nature Walk around Jamaica Pond</name><id>11367317</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255874400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/11367317/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/9/global_10706953.jpeg</photo_url></item>
