This is a powerful introductory course designed for those who are seeking an inner experience of God through meditation. Classes include teachings on the practices of the mystics and how they can be applied in the modern western world. Mysticism refers to &amp;quot;the practice of knowing the reality of God through direct experience.&amp;quot; It is certainly nothing new, as it has always been at the core of every religion and represents a more inner, experiential way of coming to know God and the spiritual world. We offer this series as an opportunity for you to discover whether the mystical path might be right for you. Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation that will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within. In each class we explore three areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Understanding the universe materially and spiritually, the Laws and Beings that govern it, and our roles as living, conscious humans in that cosmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Spiritual exercises designed to help you develop skills needed for inner work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Hands-on experiences, through which you can learn to see, hear, and feel the spiritual world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome, no matter what your previous experience or religious background may be.&lt;br /&gt;The class is free, but RSVP is required. Late admittance may be permissible (after the first week of the class), but check with the organizer to be sure. Completion of this series can lead into more advanced classes for those who are interested.&lt;br /&gt;The class is offered on six consecutive Tuesday evenings at 7:30pm, beginning June 15, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
