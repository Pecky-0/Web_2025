The towns just N &amp;amp; S of Salem shows start when we leave the harbor!  We cruise closely past Nahant &amp;amp; Winthrop’s fireworks and arrive in Boston for its show as well.  David G will stay in Salem and can take people over to the 10:38 train. Enjoy historic Salem and a picnic that includes bands, pops concert, air force fly over and fireworks at Derby Park by the harbor.&lt;br /&gt;After the picnic (about 8:30) people can stay at the park for the fireworks or take that ferry ride back into Boston (the ferry is only 2 blocks from Derby Park).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEET:&lt;/b&gt; We will meet outside by the fountain in front of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem at 4pm. Drizzle cancels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP&lt;/b&gt; REQUIRED to:&lt;b&gt;Mosaicwalks@yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt; (include a phone number and email address) for this trip, as there are many options and details including plans for the ferry so contact the TC by email, before July 3rd.  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost:&lt;/b&gt; No charge for the fire works, the Ferry is $9.50 each way and there is a $5 fee until you become a member of Mosaic of Mass.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David</member_name><member_id>4431256</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278277754000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends and members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>mosaicofmass</urlname><id>416725</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Mosaic Jewish Outdoor Club of Massachusetts</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274313983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDEPENDENCE DAY SPECTACULAR IN SALEM</name><id>13537419</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278273600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mosaicofmass/events/13537419/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/0/global_1883520.jpeg</photo_url></item>
