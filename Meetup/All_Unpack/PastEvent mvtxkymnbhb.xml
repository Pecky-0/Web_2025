We will investigate how the commentary and conditioning of the mind add to our difficulties and suffering. It is not necessary to have attended the other classes to learn from this experience, so please come by and try it, I think you'll enjoy the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course will be supported by audio instruction provided by Gil Fronsdal, primary teacher for the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Each week for the next six weeks, we will start the group by listening to his talk, which lasts about one hour, and will follow with discussion about the content and our experiences. This will be a good refresher course for those who have been meditating for years, as well as those who are new to mindfulness or meditation. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255383290000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251759884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mindful Thinking</name><id>mvtxkymnbhb</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254780000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/11251448/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
