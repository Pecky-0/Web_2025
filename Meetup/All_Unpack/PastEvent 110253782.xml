 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kinsmans (North, #28, at 4293' and South, #22, at 4358'), both part of the Appalachian Trail are popular among peakbaggers for their outstanding views, especially the alpine-like open summit of the south peak (the north summit only offers a nearby east-facing ledge. There are steep, challenging sections on the ridge, some ice/rock scrambles when not filled in with snow, but the open south summit make it all pretty worthwhile. And if that's not enough, we can also take the .2 mile spurt trail to the open summit of Bald Peak (2470') on the way up for some starter views and photo ops. For more information about these mountains, please refer to the AMC's White Mountain Guide or The 4000-Footers of the White Mountains. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #808080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you (in the cold winter months this can be particularly dangerous for the entire group if we have to wait around, getting cold). Please read the entire TRIP SUMMARY, below, before you RSVP. It is important, not only for your safety, but that of the entire group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;TRIP SUMMARY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This is a MODERATELY-paced, INTERMEDIATE-distance 10 mile hike (round trip) with an ADVANCED 3950-feet of elevation gain (we will add a total of .4 mile and 70-feet of additional gain for Bald Peak). The approximate hike time, including Bald Peak, is around 7.2 hours based on "book time" math. It may take more or less time depending on trail conditions, snow depths, etc. Always plan for spending more time on the mountain than expected. We will be taking two trails, as follows: Mt. Kinsman Trail and part of the Kinsman Ridge Trail. We will also hike the .2 mile Bald peak Spur. The majority of our elevation gain will happen on the Mt Kinsman Trail but we'll see the most challenging sections on the Kinsman Ridge Trail before and just after the summit. These section may be fairly steep and require caution! Again, there are outstanding views, especially the alpine-like open summit of the south peak (the north summit only offers a nearby east-facing ledge. The mountains are both below treeline, but the more southerly summit of the south peak (there are two, actually) does require one expose themselves to winds from all directions -- but this is not required to reach a countable summit, thus there will be limited exposure. Trail conditions will probably be snowy and may be traveled by bareboot, microspikes, crampons, and/or snowshoes. As we get closer to the date I'll know better as to what specific conditions we'll likely encounter and what you'll be expected to bring or able to leave behind and I'll be in touch. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Environment:&lt;/strong&gt; Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions so be prepared. If conditions will be or become dangerous on the trail (i.e., elevated likelihood of lightning, blizzard, dangerous winds, downpour, or dense fog, especially above treeline), I will cancel or terminate the hike - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two ahead of time. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary. While reaching the summit is always our goal, we will not succumb to "summit fever" and risk our well-being in the process. The mountain will still be there another day. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Gear Info:&lt;/strong&gt; This gear is critical in the shoulder months. Like winter, there is no cheating here. If you mess up you put everyone in danger. Below is a list describing the minimum required items to participate in this event. Hiking safely is about being prepared so that you can respond to an emergency situation or spend a night in the woods if you have to. Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footwear:&lt;/strong&gt; Proper, well-soled winter-rated hiking or mountaineering boots with heavy synthetic or wool socks with a spare pair in your pack, gaiters to keep snow out our your boots, and Microspikes/Hillsounds. You should also be prepared to bring crampons in case steep ice floes are present and full-crampon steep ascent snowshoes (talk to your EMS/REI rep). This stuff is essential. That said, as previously stated, I'll know better as to what specific conditions we'll likely encounter and what you'll be expected to bring or able to leave behind and I'll be in touch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hands and Head:&lt;/strong&gt; A synthetic or wool cap that covers your ears and warm, non-cotton waterproof gloves as well as -0-rated mittens are critical. Your rain gear/shell, should feature a hood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face and Eyes:&lt;/strong&gt; If the hike is above treeline: A face mask, balaclava or some other form of face protection. And for the eyes, glacier glasses with blinders and/or goggles with lightly tinted lenses (I find yellow is a good compromise color). I suggest splurging on "TurboFan" goggles (ESS is one brand) as the integrated fan effectively keeps fogging at bay. Also on the topic of eye protection, I find a pair of shop glasses in the pack a good addition in case we encounter an unexpected bushwhack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing:&lt;/strong&gt; Dress in layers with "wicking" synthetics next to the skin and wool over to easily regulate body temperature (clothing designed to deal with sweat during exertion and insulate even when wet). Also, it can be windy at the summit and it will typically be much colder at higher elevations so please be prepared. Make sure your layers fit comfortably over each other. DO NOT WEAR COTTON! While cotton is a great insulator when it's dry, once wet it doesn't dry easily and it rapidly conducts heat away from the body. Also consider bringing an extra layer in your pack just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outerwear:&lt;/strong&gt; Windproof/waterproof shell (with hood) as well as windproof/waterproof pants. Again, also consider bringing an extra layer. like a down or synthetic "puffy" just in case or if conditions above treeline warrant it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and Water:&lt;/strong&gt; Bring high-energy snacks making sure you have plenty of salts and sugars (this will help you make better use of your water), your choice of food for lunch, and pack extra just in case. Again, bring enough water to stay properly hydrated during the trip (2-3 litres is what I suggest, even when it's cold). Use at least two Nalgene bottles or a hydration bladder to carry your water. If using a hydration bladder like a CamelBak or Platypus, and if the weather is very cold, and especially if the tube is uninsulated, you will need to clear the tube after drinking, also pinching the valve while upright, "twanging" it, and keeping the bite-valve in your shirt. I also know of other trail remedies that can save your day, but do consider bringing spare some water in another container. It's a good idea to have a hearty meal the night before followed by a good night's sleep. Also, try to begin the hike well hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelter:&lt;/strong&gt; Be prepared to spend a night in the woods if you have to. Minimal options include an ultralight tarp, a bivy sack, or an emergency space blanket (which packs small and weighs just ounces). A pad or some way to get off the ground is also highly recommended (though pine boughs can work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Essential Gear:&lt;/strong&gt; Map and compass: don't just bring them, know how to use them. Also, a plastic whistle, headlamp with spare batteries (required, forget and you can't come), a first aid kit containing any medications you may need personally (please let me know if you have any applicable allergies, medical conditions, and special medications you may be carrying), a small knife or multipurpose tool, matches or wind-proof lighter and fire starter, a toiletries kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items), sunscreen, lip balm, sunglasses, and a waterproof pack cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Items:&lt;/strong&gt; Stowable trekking poles (recommended) and camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trailhead:&lt;/strong&gt; I suggest 93N to Exit 34C; Left to Rte 18 (Profile Rd); Left on Kerr Rd; Left on Wells Rd, Left on Rte 116, Couple of miles or so to a kinda non-nondescript parking area on the left. It's about 0.3 mi from the Franconia/Easton town line. Please consult a map and/or contact me if you have questions. Elevation: 1030' &lt;br /&gt;
