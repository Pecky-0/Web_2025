The India Association of Greater Boston has arranged a full schedule of entertaining performances featuring some of the most talented dancers and musicians in the New England area. There will also be food stalls selling lip smacking chaat, garam garam chai as well as the regular Indian fare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's meet up at 3:30pm near the food stalls and stake out a good spot near the stage. Or if everyone prefers to have food first (that's completely understandable), then we can do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the songs list is available at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iagb.org/index.php/india-day-2009/songs-list/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.iagb.org/i...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and did we mention that Akshay and Amrita are going to be performing on that day too?!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karan</member_name><member_id>8985082</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amrita</member_name><member_id>9997290</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Akshay Navaladi</member_name><member_id>9999642</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250811896000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249994639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Independance day at the hatch shell!</name><id>11085043</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250451000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11085043/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
