<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our group is really enjoying getting together to share meditation time, connecting with each other, sharing conversation that is real, learning more about what the path of the mystic is like. We are on class number three out of the series of four. We begin each class with a guided meditation, which people are finding helpful for learning how to deeply relax and go inside and connect with their inner selves. Then we listen to a selected reading from writings of a mystic of one of the world religions. The last two classes we heard from Hindu and Islamic mystics, and this week we will read from one of the Christian mytics. What is a mystic? It is someone who does not care about dogma but who seeks to find out and experience for themselves the reality of God inside of them. This is the deeper purpose of meditation. All are welcome, both new and old members.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
