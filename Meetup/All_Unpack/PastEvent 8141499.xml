The nearest T is South Station, call me if you have trouble finding it. If your running late let me know so I know to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to ride along the bike path next to the water down to U Mass/ JFK library and back. There is a small part where we need to ride on the road but most of the ride will be along the path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will finish up at the Barking Crab and reward ourselves with some nice cold beer. If anyone just wants to join for the drinks I would say we would get there around 3 but you can call me in the afternoon for a better estimate if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone got a frisbee they could bring on the ride?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215687857000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213454159000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike ride  - South Shore / Afternoon drinks at the Barking Crab</name><id>8141499</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215356400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/8141499/</event_url></item>
