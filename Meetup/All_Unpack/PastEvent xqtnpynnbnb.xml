<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Two Ravens Kindred&lt;/b&gt; is hosting a Pubmoot! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're gathering on Sunday, October 10, 2010 (hey.10/10/10!) at Delaney's, a tap room/restaurant in the Westville neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut. We'll meet starting at 4:00 PM. There are two 'sides' to Delaney's. One looks like a typical college bar - wooden booths, pool table, etc - we will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; be there. We'll be on the restaurant side, either at a large table in/outside or up in the smaller &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; area attached to it. Look for the hammers around the necks; that's usually the best sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE RSVP so that we can get a head count to make a reservation with. You can always drop by and we'll pull up a chair, but if we have a clue how many people are coming, it helps to start off! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First timers, old timers... all are welcome!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info and directions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.delaneystaproom.com" target="_blank"&gt;Delaney's Tap Room &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Hicks</member_name><member_id>3427608</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patricia Lafayllve</member_name><member_id>12763387</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286800627000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Followers of Asatru</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>asatru-242</urlname><id>369297</id><group_lat>41.8600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut &amp; Western Mass Asatru Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285765629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TRK Pubmoot</name><id>xqtnpynnbnb</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286740800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/asatru-242/events/14936576/</event_url></item>
