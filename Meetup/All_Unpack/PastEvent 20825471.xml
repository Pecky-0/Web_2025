one of the best mini-golf course in the East Coast, as a plus -&amp;gt;
minimal golf skill is required :-). And for the more ambitious,
they have also got an excellent driving range. The mini-golf is
about $7 for 18 holes, and the driving range is $9 per bucket of
balls. People can do either or both. Afterwards, we can catch some
saki / sushi in around Cleveland Circle / Coolidge Corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Link - &lt;a href="http://www.mcgolfonline.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.mcgolfonline.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: for those coming by public transportation, since
this place is close to three T-Stations (Cleveland Circle/Resevoir,
which are near each other, and Forest Hills), but a bit far for
walking, I need people to sign up early and and tell us which
station they will come by, so we can plan to pick people up at the
station.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308543402000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307111435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sports Meetup - MiniGolf / Driving Range</name><id>20825471</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308506400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/20825471/</event_url></item>
