CHECK OUT SOME OF OUR OTHER SUMMER ACTIVITIES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annual Wedeln Ski and Outdoor Club Canoe Trip will take place Saturday July 12th.  We put in at Canal Bridge in Fryeburg Main and take out at Walkers Bridge.  The total trip is just under seven miles but our mellow pace means we enjoy a full day (about 5 hours) on the river.  Please feel free to RSVP on this site BUT to resserve your spot you MUST mail in the Registration form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost includes canoe rental(including paddle, pfd), dinner(including beer), lunch and continental breakfast(Sat and Sun), and a bus to and from the river.  We also host a bonfire party at night with beer/wine cost included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost for the weekend ($75) does not include guest fees so please add $20 dollar a night for guests staying at the Wedeln House.  I recommend guests stay both Friday and Saturday.  Friday night is the best time to meet people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is new this year???&lt;br /&gt; - Pigroast BBQ - with all the fixins.  Also plenty of options if you do not dine on swine.&lt;br /&gt; - Hawaiian Luau Theme - for the river , the BBQ and the bonfire party.  Come ready to limbo for prizes.&lt;br /&gt; - Prizes for best decorated canoe and more.&lt;br /&gt; - SINGLE kayaks option for the same cost.  perfect for people that want to learn to solo to paddle or are anti-social.&lt;br /&gt; -  Registration form - see  &amp;quot;files&amp;quot; section in this meet up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have your own canoe or kayak then cost for the weekend is only $45(no bus), there are no other substitutions or savings even if you plan to skip meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mail checks and form by JUNE 20th to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Vecchi&lt;br /&gt;{email tom_lane@harvard.edu to get full address}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 important things:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Check should be made out to &amp;quot;Wedeln&amp;quot; - not me, not Jen, not Wedlens :).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Please use the enclosed Registration form, follow directions&lt;br /&gt;3.  No LATE people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guest fees should be pay ahead of time (include $40 added to check):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT - This is a huge weekend for the canoe outfitters on the Saco.  If your check/letter is not postmarked by 6/20 it is highly likely that we will not have a spot for you.  If you are late please do not show up with your own canoe and hope to &amp;quot;tag along&amp;quot;,  This trip is difficult to organize and supervise and having people who are &amp;quot;kind of with us but not really&amp;quot; can lead to problems.  Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;???- SCHEDULE ???&lt;br /&gt;Here is the basic schedule - All times are aprox. and everything usually runs a bit late. If you or your friends do not have a canoe partner we will find you a paddle buddy.  We pair several people up that morning and it can actually be more fun to be put in a canoe with people you do not know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SATURDAY July 12th&lt;br /&gt;8:15am to 9am Continental Breakfast - Bagels, Juice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:45am Buses arrive at Wedeln.
