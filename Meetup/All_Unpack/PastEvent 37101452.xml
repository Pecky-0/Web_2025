There are significant opportunities for BIM tools to address issues related to green building. Data incorporated into a Building Information Model can be used to analyze the performance of a building, and incorporating these analytical studies into the early design is a major step toward a sustainable project. Join us as we review the native energy analysis capabilities of Revit, as well as an overview of the latest sustainable design analysis applications and how they integrate with BIM models. Other discussion topics will include workflow, LEED tracking, file types and types of analysis. I look forward to seeing you all there! Best, Andy Keating / Stack Design Build&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Wade Keating</member_name><member_id>8961244</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Armstrong</member_name><member_id>13692153</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320252000000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Revit Users</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Rhode-Island-Revit-Users-Group</urlname><id>1414420</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Revit Users Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318425347000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BIM and Energy Analysis - with AIAri</name><id>37101452</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1320183000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Rhode-Island-Revit-Users-Group/events/37101452/</event_url></item>
