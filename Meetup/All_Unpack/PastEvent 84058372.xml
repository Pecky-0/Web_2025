Brook delves into Ayn Rand’s beliefs that charity should be undertaken only in self-interest and not out of a sense of false morality – or, worse, guilt. He explains that Rand’s followers would rather applaud the act of making money than giving it away. Rambo counters that charity as a virtue is critical to our collective well-being, enriching our society as it promotes a healthy economy. She argues that self-sacrifice through philanthropy is a form of love in which people of any (or no) religion can participate. Join us as we determine whether benevolence or earning is the real virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
