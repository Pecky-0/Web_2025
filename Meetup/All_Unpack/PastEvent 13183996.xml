This will be a family event where we encourage you and your children to bring and share your favorite writings that connect with and support the Earth Mother's rhythms and teachings!   Join us for more fun around our beautiful new fire pit (weather permitting, otherwise we will drum inside))....experience the benefits of drumming : heightened awareness, creativity, stress relief, exercise, self expression, unity, joy and many more! All levels of experience are welcome, especially those who have never drummed.... nobody is asked to perform individually... this is a laid back circle where everyone is encouraged to follow their own rhythm. Feel how the meditative qualities of drumming and following your own authentic rhythm can synergize in a circle! You might be surprised by your own abilities, as well as the joyful vibration that results from the collective. Bring a drum or other percussion if you have one, but if not, we have extras!!This will be a regular thing at The Larches,so keep checking the calendar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sally Fiore</member_name><member_id>8203589</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272215023000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271276376000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Earth Day Drum for Joy - family event </name><id>13183996</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271977200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/13183996/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/c/global_7505116.jpeg</photo_url></item>
