MOBODY WANTS TO PLAY IN THE RAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPRING HAS SPRUNG...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;WHEN the hounds of spring are on winter's traces,&lt;br /&gt;    The mother of months in meadow or plain&lt;br /&gt;Fills the shadows and windy places&lt;br /&gt;    With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Algernon Charles Swinburne   1837-1909&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's time for all the little Puggies to cast off  their winter coats, forsake their warm beds on the heat registers, and come out to play in the warm (we hope!) sunshine.  Once again, our elderly Puggie friend, Uncle Oscar is hosting!  We have some new members, and I know we have some new dogs, so it's time for everyone to get aquainted and re-aquainted!  We hope you all can join us for the first South of Boston Pug Meetup of 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP...&lt;br /&gt;The December 2006 meetup was held at Clovis's place in Brockton, MA.  It wasn't too cold (for a New England December!), but it was cold enough to keep most people home!  However, several lucky Pugs did come out to play, while their owners braved the early winter weather.   Thanks to all who came, and to John and also Charley for providing the goodies! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have!  If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend.  Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!   &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177437888000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1165969650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug April 2007 Meetup - It's almost here!</name><id>5323386</id><headcount>31</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177264800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5323386/</event_url></item>
