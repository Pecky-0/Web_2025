They say there is a limit although not indicated as to what this limit is on the site.  I looked at their drink menu (which is not discounted during 5-7pm) but the drinks seem good.  It has been a while since I have been MiniBar but the scene is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a Monday night out person.  Tuesday - Thursday's are good!  I am out of work by 4:30pm the latest and can head over to the venue afterwards. Also, I can see if they will allow reservations but really do not see that happening as it is a smaller venue.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call or Text Me but I will Check-In with updated information as to what to look for :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Des</member_name><member_id>10861926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1290217920000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280948535000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour @ MiniBar</name><id>14319490</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284499800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/14319490/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/6/4/global_17140708.jpeg</photo_url></item>
