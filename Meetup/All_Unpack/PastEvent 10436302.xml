We are planning some homemade pizza and BBQ nibbles.  Bring a salad or a dessert and we can enjoy the pond and a little game of catch! Party hats and treats provided. The celebration will be at Wilton at the lodge at camp Anne Jackson.  Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.girlscoutsgwm.org/About/annejackson.html" target="_blank"&gt;link &lt;/a&gt;for the lodge in Wilton  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;There has been a change for this venue.  We have added a hike. We will meet at 2 PM at Miller State Park for a gentle hike before the party.  The party at the lodge will then begin at 5 PM after the hike. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller state Park in Peterborough does charge $4 a head and there are a few different walking trails. There is a great view at the top and a few picnic tables for refreshments and water for the dogs if we decide to go all the way up.  Again, we will meet at the parking lot at Miller State Park at 2 PM and should be back at the lodge by 5 PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the hike we will go onto the lodge at Camp Anne Jackson in Wilton which is about 15 minutes from Miller State Park for the party.  Please bring your favorite short pet DVD clip (or record one of your pooch) in case of rain and we can play them in the lodge and judge the best pet DVD.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can join us for a party hat moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt; G&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gabriella Lopez</member_name><member_id>8643209</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245062959000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242651249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Birthday Bash for Hugo - Hike First</name><id>10436302</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244311200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10436302/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/global_8688259.jpeg</photo_url></item>
