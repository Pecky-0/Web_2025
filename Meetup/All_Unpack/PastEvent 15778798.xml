Feel free to bring her some kind of silly gift. Not mandatory but make it something fun. She's turning 30 so we want it to be special for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back by popular demand - I'm not kidding. No less than 8 people have asked me to have another one of these. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;post-Holiday Party  for Gentiles, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, buddhists, Agnostics and Even athiests - Presbyterian's require special permission !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We strongly encourage flannels with cozy slippers.  Those not in festive garb will be required to sing for the rest of us.  After they clean the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know what you plan on bringing so we don't get duplicates. Every guest doesn't have to bring a dish. We don't need that much food. So you can either bring a dish or BYOB as long as we share whatever arrives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK in the spirit of a Healthy new year. All food must be healthy... or at least not all sugar or fat. Let's make it a healthy lean new year.  Please ??? I need your help. Stop bringing yummy fattening food cuz I eat it when you leave. I have no willpower... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gifts not necessary !&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy with the Santa Outfit</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295717213000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292844618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Post Holiday Pajama Party â€“ Carol's Birthday Party @ Roger's House </name><id>15778798</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295478000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/15778798/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
