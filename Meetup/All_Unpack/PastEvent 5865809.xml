I'll also pack some t-shirts, bumper stickers, and whatever else I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Given that it's Bike Week, I suspect parking will be, um, difficult.  So be prepared for a little circling--but the crowd should be worth it!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181585425000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181245644000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign Wave at Bike Week - Weirs Beach</name><id>5865809</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181412000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/5865809/</event_url></item>
