We will be leaving from the Shea Ice Rink parking lot at 651 Willard Street in Quincy at 9:00am on Saturday, November 21st. This will be a relatively long hike winding through five miles of rocky trails. Good boots and warm layers are required. Please pack a lunch and plenty of water as the hike will take 5+ hours with plenty of stops to enjoy the views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is co-listed with the boston AMC young members so it is ideal for those who are under 40 or just young at heart.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258985563000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258127999000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A walk in the woods - young members</name><id>11866578</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258812000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11866578/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/8/global_11786248.jpeg</photo_url></item>
