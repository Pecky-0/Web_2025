Just went back to work after a recent surgery and thought it would be fun to do a happy hour. &lt;a href="http://www.johnnyraysrestaurant.com" target="_blank"&gt;Johnny Rae's &lt;/a&gt;offers during Friday night happy hour a free buffett which is usually wings and maybe pasta or pizza. There will some special on drinks during that time as well. So take a break from cooking and spend time with some friendly people.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Near the bar/buffett area</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annette</member_name><member_id>2905200</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367845700000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
