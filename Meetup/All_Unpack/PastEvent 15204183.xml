Everyone is ensured personal attention and receives a message. Group readings are excellent forums for opening up to the process of mediumship and learning about ?life after life? in an environment that is gentle, safe and supportive. Quite often, those who attend find that they share a common bond with others in the group. Sometimes, new friendships are formed or a message directed to another participant is exactly what you need to hear to help your healing. Nothing is by chance! Similar to John Edwards ?Crossing Over? but on a more intimate scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seating is very limited at this event! Please contact us at 781-665-8844 to register and reserve your spot, cost is $60 per person.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melody Joy Gaeta, Realtor</member_name><member_id>3036353</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288119686000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287853808000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Group medium reading in Melrose</name><id>15204183</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287872100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/15204183/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/d/global_17499549.jpeg</photo_url></item>
