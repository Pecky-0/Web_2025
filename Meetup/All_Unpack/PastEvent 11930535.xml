In fact lets try to do this every couple of months to keep us all turning the stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWAP:&lt;br /&gt;find yarn you don't want any more.  place it in a bag with a post it detailing how much you'd like for it and your initials.  bring bag to knitting and put it on the table.  If someone wants your yarn for that amount they'll pay you or perhaps you'll trade for some yarn they have.  It's all of our first time with this so we're winging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269124437000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258889819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yarn &amp; Book SWAP- Thursday March 18th</name><id>11930535</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268951400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/11930535/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/9/global_9564697.jpeg</photo_url></item>
