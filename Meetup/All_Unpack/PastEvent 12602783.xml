This is the same group that we do the Wings and Wheels show with, but this isn't the Wings and Wheels event. This is a show that they host by themselves, but they have offered us some space to park a couple of airplanes and setup a table. At this table, we can provide information about our Wings and Wheels, Young Eagles, and Learn to Fly events as well as general information about why airports and pilots are so great to the thousands of people they bring in. Since their event is on 2/20, this is too easy to pass up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://clubs.hemmings.com/clubsites/earlyfordv8newengland/Fleamarket.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://clubs.hemmings...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the event day. They start pretty early. It will help to have some people get there early and some people later (say 9am?) to relive the early people and maybe let them walk around the show. We just need a couple people to stand around, watch out for the airplanes, answer questions, hand out flyers, and take Young Eagle signups maybe.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271758425000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266174209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Early Ford V8 Club's Car Show</name><id>12602783</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271584800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/12602783/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
