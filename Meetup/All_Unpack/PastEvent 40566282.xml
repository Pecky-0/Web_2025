I always forget which Sunday has the Goethe films! As you know, the films in the series are always different, and I like the look of this one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working for 45 years in Germany as a Turkish &amp;ldquo;Gastarbeiter,&amp;rdquo; or guest worker, H&amp;uuml;seyin Yilmaz, now in his 70s, announces to his family that he has bought a house in Turkey and wants everyone to go back with him to renovate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is not enamored with the idea and a heated debate ensues. Adding fuel to the fire is the revelation of granddaughter Canan that she is pregnant from her English boyfriend, whom the family has no idea about. In order to comfort her six-year-old cousin Cenk, who was bullied on his first day at school for being a &amp;ldquo;foreigner,&amp;rdquo; Canan tries to cheer him up by telling him the fantastic story of how and why they all ended up in Germany, even though they aren&amp;rsquo;t Germans. Where their real home is, is a question they are all confronted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
