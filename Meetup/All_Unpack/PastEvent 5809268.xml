Bring your signs and banners (so will we), and let's get a crowd outside that just can't be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Campaign supporters will have a designated rally area in the parking lot in front of Joan of Arc Residence Hall. That parking lot is in sightline of the Sullivan Arena. The earliest supporters can arrive is 4:00 p.m. on debate day. All signs must be carried in and carried out. No 4' by 8' signs will be permitted. No signs allowed/staked in the ground -- including along Saint Anselm Drive. No blow horns, bands, loudspeakers, audio systems will be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Thankfully, enthusiasm is still permitted. So come on out and give Dr. Paul a hero's welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Many thanks to Ron Paul for President HQNH  for this introduction.(&lt;a href="http://ronpaul.meetup.com/6/"&gt;http://ronpaul.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;) )&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183685577000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179925738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NH Presidential Debate!!</name><id>5809268</id><headcount>60</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181073600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/5809268/</event_url></item>
