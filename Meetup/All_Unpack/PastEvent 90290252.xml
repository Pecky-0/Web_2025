I have a couple of people going with my other group, so I thought I'd invite everyone from this group too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Oyama has great hibachi but I have not tried their sushi. I have heard good things though. Check out their website: &lt;a href="http://www.oyamajapanesecuisine.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.oyamajapanesecuisine.com/&lt;/a&gt; For those that are adventurous enough, I am okay with ordering a bunch of rolls to share if that's something you want to do too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try and bring cash if you can to avoid the issue with separate checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep everyone posted in terms of how many group members from my other group will be attending. And no-shows will be regarded with the same policy as always. I have to make a reservation, so it looks bad with the restaurant if we say we'll have 15 and only 5 show up.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The reservation will be in my name, but call or text if you can't find us 716-307-6590</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jocelyn</member_name><member_id>8761972</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352762437000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Smiling Happy Faces</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford</urlname><id>1498492</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>Eat, Laugh, and Be Merry in West Hartford</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352249980000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sushi (or Hibachi if we choose) dinner at Oyama in Cromwell Sat Nov 10th</name><id>90290252</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352593800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford/events/90290252/</event_url></item>
