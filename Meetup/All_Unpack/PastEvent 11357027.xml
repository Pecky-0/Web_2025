I believe te weather should be good then too&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Back of North lot near trail head: there's a rest room / hut there too.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>MAtt</member_name><member_id>9746450</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256246567000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252795299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Blue Hill</name><id>11357027</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253466000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/11357027/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/1/global_7101473.jpeg</photo_url></item>
