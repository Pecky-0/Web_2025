Meeting point is 12:30pm at he northbound trailhead on Fieldstone Dr. off of Blueberry Hill Rd just north of the Shopping Center on 101. See &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.876467,-71.614594&amp;amp;spn=0.024625,0.04652&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Thursday the wheather is supposed to be dry in the sixties. I recently tried the Bicentennial Trail. It's not too challenging, but has a couple of steep or tricky sections, or in other words, ideal to get you in shape after the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding future rides: There are a number of other trails around Amherst. Bob and Geri recently told me about the area around Grater Road near Baboosic Lake. So in the coming weeks I plan to do future lunch rides out there to check out those other trails. Personally, I'm pretty flexible with time and day (Monday through Thursday) so if you'd like to join but can only do early evening (e.g. 4 or 5) let me know and I'll try to plan it so that it fits most peoples' schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing: Please RSVP as I just might change my plans on short notice if nobody responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: As there haven't been any reservations yet and Laura asked about Friday, I'll just move this ride. Maybe it will accommodate other people as well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209919321000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209404886000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lunch ride Bicentennial Trail, Amherst, NH</name><id>7828508</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209745800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/7828508/</event_url></item>
