The place must be surrounded by good luck and karma. Over the years he's known over 60 couples who've met there and who eventually got married. Even last year a man walked in off the street and simply asked a woman the score of the baseball game and they're now engaged. The Sevens first opened its doors in 1933 and has been passing along good luck and karma ever since!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sevens - A Beacon Hill Pub&lt;br /&gt;77 Charles St&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02114&lt;br /&gt;(617) 523-9074&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you at the very lucky.... warm and cozy neighborhood pub at 7:00PM!
