So this seems like a very good time to take a trip to South Boston to tour the brewery and do a little a tasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the Harpoon website&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;You will be guided through the brewery on a tour with our staff and learn how Harpoon makes all of its beers. After the tour, all visitors over 21 years of age will enjoy samples of Harpoon and UFO beers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes a souvenir glass, tour, and tasting. A portion of fee goes to Harpoon Helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will try and hit the first tour at 11:30, and after the tasting, we will grab lunch at one of the nearby pubs and restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour costs $5, and make sure to bring valid ID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260808012000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259773365000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harpoon Brewery Tour</name><id>12000041</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260634500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/12000041/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/b/global_5037611.jpeg</photo_url></item>
