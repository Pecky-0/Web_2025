This is the largest Singles Dances in NH, with between 200 and 300 singles, in a ballroom setting, but not ballroom dancing. It has the most tasteful and variety of people and ages you will find anywhere. Because of the popularity of this Dance, tables and seats will be hard to hold, much past 8:30. If you are late? The Cover Charge goes from $10 to $12 after 9 pm. &lt;br /&gt;Steve O. can not guaranty you will dance at this event. But, he will do his best to introduce you to as many people as he can find. Therefore, if you don't dance? It will not be, because you didn't know anyone. So, please get there as close to 8 pm as possible. So, you can meet some new people as, Steve O. introduces you to everyone at our tables. Also, ask where Steve O., or Meetup is sitting as you pay at the door. They will show or tell you where we are sitting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see you there,&lt;br /&gt;susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs on the tables, to the left as you come in the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275229617000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
