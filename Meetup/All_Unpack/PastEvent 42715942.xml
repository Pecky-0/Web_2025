&lt;p&gt;IS THERE FAT IN THAT? is Ellen Domingos' personal story of growing up in Maine, winning a national beauty pageant, and becoming&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a working actress and a super model in NYC. All through this journey she battled an eating disorder. Using humor and music, Ellen delights audiences with her charm, amazing voice, and winning personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Theater&lt;/em&gt; in Portland presented the world premiere IS THERE FAT IN THAT? The Portland Press Herald had this to say about the show, &amp;ldquo;Domingos has crafted a piece that is not only touchingly honest, but also delightfully entertaining. Domingos had the audience captivated from the moment she stepped onstage looking stunning in a stylish black suit and sparkly red top&amp;hellip; Laughter quickly followed as she began relaying her autobiographical tale. Her expressive face accented each comically phrased situation and perfectly timed quip&amp;hellip;The audience reveled in her stories and she laughed right along with them&amp;hellip;Domingos has it all: looks, personality, charisma, comic timing, wit and a powerful, sultry vocal that's beautifully showcased in songs cleverly interwoven into her stories."&lt;/p&gt;

The Players' Ring is located in a nineteenth century brick building on Marcy Street on the grounds of Prescott Park in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The historic building is owned by the City of Portsmouth and is fitted out as a &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; theatre. With a seating capacity of 75, The Players' Ring annual attendance is approximately 6,500. Since its creation, more than 30 local production companies have presented plays at The Players' Ring. While some form to produce a single special event, some production companies produce shows on an annual basis. Over 200 actors, directors, playwrights and technicians work together to produce plays at The Players' Ring each year. Over the past five years, over $180,000 has been distributed to those involved in Players' Ring productions. Original works account for half of each season&amp;rsquo;s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
