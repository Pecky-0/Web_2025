Many of us have had an ecstatic experience of love through emotional or physical relationships, but we are unable to maintain those good feelings.  Love is freely given to us by the Universe.  Love flows in and out of us.  Even more, love is a natural state of being for humans, just as it is for the tides of the ocean.  Allowing the waters of life to flow through you is how you can come to feel and know the continuous pleasures of love's ecstasy.  In this seminar, learn to relax and let go, so that love can flow into and out of you freely and powerfully. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
