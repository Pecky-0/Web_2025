&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine or 1.75MLsplease) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvre or desert.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up. If you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more (750 ml) with your dish. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $25 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste. Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;Reds - Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot, shiraz pinot noir.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;Whites - sav blanc, chards, Riesling, pinot grigio, etc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a person's spot if you do not show up. If you must cancel, the earlier the better if there is a waiting list.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;*Please note* The address and directions will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to the entire "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence. It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly. I will have water and coffee too.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;This is a multimeetup function to blow this out with a great party. Only sign up on one site if you belong to more than one for an accurate count unless you end up on a wait list.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;Enjoy the night in fun, style and class.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;**As always this is a multi group meetup and a BYOWG...bring your own wine glass!!  I have 60 but this may surpass that quantity.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
