 The term Musquash comes from the Algonquin word for muskrat. Today it describes a forest block of over 900 acres in the western part of Londonderry. The area is made up of forested, rolling hills dotted with wetland areas that provide natural habitat for moose, deer, beaver, and painted and Blandingâ€™s turtles to name just a few species. This landscape also provides an enjoyable place for outdoor recreation for the citizens of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are over 4 different entrances to the Musquash Conservation Area so please use the correct address above for where the hike will start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to a trail map:&lt;/p&gt;
