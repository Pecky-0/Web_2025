If you want to avoid the cover charge be there before. If you plan to stay a while and order food I suggest putting in for a table. Please call Harrington's if you have any questions. Wear green, bring Irish Red Heads and Happy St.Patty's Day! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is for the suburban folks. A large group of us attended each of the last 3 years. This year St. Patrick's Day is on a Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives &lt;a href="http://www.RedSoxNatives.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;are inviting any available Boston Happy Hour members to celebrate St Patricks Day at Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield. Harrington's is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great too. &lt;a href="http://www.harringtonspub.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's is all Irish, all day, all night, on both floors. There is live entertainment all day at Harrington's led by the owner Dan's band Casterbridge Union, Terry Weir and others. There is $10.00 cover after 1:00 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear your green and be there at 1:00 pm or afterward. The place will be packed all day and night! I suggest any RSVPs coordinate by E Mail to meet other attendees at whatever time works best. Please RSVP and let us know if and at approximately what time you will join us. Some of us will be having dinner and will be there well into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station by the Haverhill and Reading Trains stopping at Wakefield with less than a 10 minute walk up Albion to Main to Water Street. &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to pay in cash as you order or maintain your bar tab and settle with and tip your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Pick a time and Coordinate with other RSVPs by E Mail</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Red Sox Natives</member_name><member_id>12040580</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363695950000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361141647000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>St Patrick's Day with the Red Sox Natives at Harrington's Irish Pub</name><id>105069652</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363539600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/105069652/</event_url></item>
