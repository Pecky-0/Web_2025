It also supplied water power for the mills in Windsor Locks.  The old towpath has been converted into a multi-use paved trail.  There are 4.5 miles of trail from Suffield to Windsor Locks.  We will start at the north end in Suffield.  The south end is accessible off of route 140 in Windsor Locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canal is closed in the winter to protect birds of prey that live here then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 4 miles on a level trail. The leader will turn around at the 2 mile mark.  Others can continue as desired.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  Rain cancels.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.  Take caution as the sides of the trail are steep, falling off into the canal and the Connecticut River.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  1200 Canal Rd, Suffield, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?City=Suffield&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=1200+Canal+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255040854000</updated><rating><average>4.55000019073</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252327857000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Windsor Locks Canal Walk, Suffield, CT</name><id>11308723</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254677400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/11308723/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
