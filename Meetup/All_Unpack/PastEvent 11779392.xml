The band’s vocalist is considered especially noteworthy and has often inspired comparisons to Jeff Buckley and Coldplay, particularly in reviews of their well-received self-titled sophomore album. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is a bit removed from the music I typically find myself listening to, I am excited to see them live after hearing excellent reviews of their live show from friends, and after having their self-titled album on heavy rotation this summer. In my opinion, the beautiful vocals and swirling guitars on this album give it a certain romantic quality, which I really enjoy and think others will too. This should be a great show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are opening for a band called &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/mutemath"&gt;MUTEMATH&lt;/a&gt;, who I am unfamiliar with.
