If you'd like to lead climb, don't forget your to bring your rope :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet up at 7:00 PM by the picnic tables near the front bouldering area, to make introductions and team up. If arriving later, just come find us on the walls. Hopefully you can recognize me (see "Event Host" right) from my picture, and/or I'll try to remember to write a description of what I'm wearing on the white board near the bathrooms, so you can find us more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never climbed here before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing. Call the gym or see the website below for more info. Full-access Day Pass $18. Bouldering-Only Pass $15. Mondays are Women's Night: Women's Day Pass $10.
