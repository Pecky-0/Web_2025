I checked their website &amp;quot;www.barcahartford.com/hours.html&amp;quot; and it looks great!  Located at 1429 Park St on the corner of Bartholomew St where the parking lot is (across from the restaurant).  Parking is also on the street if you can find a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting on a TUESDAY this time at 6:30pm for those who'd like to get a drink or appetizer from the &amp;quot;Happy Hour&amp;quot; (ends at 7:00pm) menu.  We will be ordering dinner at 7:00pm, and try not to arrive any later than that, please allow for traffic and parking, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will collect $1.00 from attendees to defray costs of running this group. - Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation under "Meetup"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy</member_name><member_id>3384225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242864196000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239052509000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BARCAS TAPAS RESTAURANT 04/14/09 6:30PM</name><id>10129549</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239748200000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/10129549/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
