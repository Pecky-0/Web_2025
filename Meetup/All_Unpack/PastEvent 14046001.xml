Martino will provide examples of the projects BlackBox works on as well as hypothetical examples of how to make things work (such as a dc motor or solenoid or a timer) in order to talk about methods of prototyping for proof of concept. This show and tell session will demonstrate how an idea becomes a workable prototype to be handed over to a fabrication house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martino founded BlackBox Technologies in 1994 as an electronics systems consulting firm. BlackBox Technologies provides electronics and test systems for military, aerospace, R&amp;amp;D, commercial, automotive, manufacturing, explosives, lasers, communications and industrial applications. BlackBox Technologies provides proven and reliable systems to the end user. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Cormier</member_name><member_id>6323188</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281453525000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278632774000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August Public Meeting</name><id>14046001</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280961900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/14046001/</event_url></item>
