The Open Mike started last week on the 10th, by one of the 'band leaders' who plays at the Dommy Doyle Open Mike, where I am in the house band.  The organizer invited me to play for 1/2 hour (weekly) with friends (yesterday).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - anyone who would like to play - RSVP yes, let me know, and we can rehearse before then on Sunday from around 2 to 6 at a separate meetup.  Or if you can't make it then, we'll set up a separate appointment.  If you just want to come down and play without rehearsing, RSVP and let me know, and let me know what songs, so it can be arranged.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a drum set, backing band (if necessary) and we can do whatever you want (originals standards, etc)!  We will be able to accomodate about 5 to 7 people in that time (drums, bass, lead guitar, (keys), other instruments and a few singer songwriters.)    This can be a weekly event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants can also come down to check it out, listen &amp;amp; have a beer - without RSVPing&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Bill - 6'4"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>9500592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268945631000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268326502000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Mike at Legends in Waltham</name><id>12849352</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268870400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/12849352/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/global_11501162.jpeg</photo_url></item>
