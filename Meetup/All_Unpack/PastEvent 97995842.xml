<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Since we seem to actually be having some winter weather this year, let's cook up some soup and have a swap. Bring a soup of your choice in ~ individual size serving containers (some people have reused glass jars or plastic yogurt cups) with the recipe attached. Each serving you bring you can swap for another that you would like to try. Swapping will start at 1:15. I'll have plenty of tea for all :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devon</member_name><member_id>847253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359937444000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357357705000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Soup Swap</name><id>97995842</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359828000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/97995842/</event_url></item>
