It really is worth the trip! In many ways.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let''s spread our wings a little huh? We've put this off a few times..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a trip I've made a few times with Dave Rocheford and it's an excellent one. We fly into Republic KFRG, class D, and take the short hop over to the most incredible Sunday brunch at the 56th fighter group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.56thfgrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.56thfgrest...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Sunday Brunch is always a special production at the 56th Fighter Group. The tremendous buffet features a wide variety of items every Sunday and offers a number of wonderful options to appease almost any palate, including features such as made-to-order waffles and omelets, fajita, fresh seafood, and carving stations. The brunch doesn’t stop there though. It also includes fresh breakfast pastries and hot breakfast items, an assortment of fresh salads, a collection of hot seafood and meat dishes, a specialty “junior pilot” station, desserts, cappuccino, juices and champagne&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is about $25 per person. But bring your appetites... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flight is about 1.5 hrs and is awesome. We cross over from Groton Conn to L.I. You can also see Fisher Island, a future fly out of ours...Down to the Gold Coast over Billy Joel, Jerry Seinfeld and a few other noteables houses.... You'll be able to see the NYC from the short distance... Real nice flight...Better take your cameras for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KFRG" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aopa.org/aifp/aifp.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.aopa.org/a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271164043000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269431028000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Brunch at the 56th Fighter Group,  Long Island...
