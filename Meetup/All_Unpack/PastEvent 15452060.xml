The movie is showing upstairs, so I will try to grab a  table by the windows at the top of the escalator.  If you should get there before me, grab a table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, I have been a fan of Johnny Depp forever....all that talent and he is wonderful eye candy too!   Should be interesting to see him do an action movie with the queen of action films Angelina Jolie.   I am hoping this is going to be a thrill ride from start to finish!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my picture on the site so you can recognize me.  I will be wearing a meetup pin and have a meetup sign.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group on the way in, we gather outside the room the movie is showing in after to allow for discussions about the movie, restroom breaks and to get a head count of those who are interested in heading out for a bite to eat and lively discussion.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: December 10, 2010    &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Columbia Pictures (Sony)    &lt;br /&gt;Director: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck    &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Julian Fellowes, Christopher McQuarrie, Jeffrey Nachmanoff    &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Timothy Dalton, Steven Berkoff    &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Thriller    &lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for violence and brief strong language)    &lt;br /&gt;Official Website:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetourist-movie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetourist...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: &amp;quot;The Tourist&amp;quot; revolves around Frank (Depp), an American tourist visiting Italy to mend a broken heart.
