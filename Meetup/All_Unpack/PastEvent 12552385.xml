<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We've decided to have a game night and party each month during the winter (and this is the third of 3 and final one for this winter). This helps break up the long nights and to socialize with lots of fun! This event will be held at Janice's condo complex clubhouse (a.k.a. the hall) in South Windsor. We'll have an large fireplace with fire, music, tables &amp;amp; chairs, bathrooms, and full kitchen available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the games we have already: &lt;br /&gt;* Pictionary &lt;br /&gt;* Picture Picture &lt;br /&gt;* Worst Case Scenario &lt;br /&gt;* Trivial Pursuit &lt;br /&gt;* Scrabble&lt;br /&gt;* Fact or Crap &lt;br /&gt;* Jenga (well a knockoff version) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd like to see someone bring these as well as anything else: &lt;br /&gt;* Bolderdash &lt;br /&gt;* Cranium &lt;br /&gt;* Cards (for various card games)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring any other game you might think 4 - 6 people at least could play at the same time. Team games would be great too. Note this is an indoor game night. We are not doing horseshoes or lawn darts! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Food&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplied already: &lt;br /&gt;* Paper and glass products &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan to bring to share any of: &lt;br /&gt;* Finger food &lt;br /&gt;* Snacks &lt;br /&gt;* Small entree (plan to feed 8 people!) &lt;br /&gt;* Drinks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hall Rental Donation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would appreciate donations of any amount (maybe $2 - $5 each person?) to help offset the cost of the hall rental. Donations can be made at the event. (We really appreciated the donations at the last Feb. event and we were able to cover the rental. Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at a hall at a condo complex in South Windsor.  The &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;address will be sent to those who respond &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; about a couple days before the event.&lt;/span&gt; If you sign up last minute be sure to e-mail Janice or Kevin for directions. Limitation on RSVP's is due to parking limitations. We all hope you can attend and enjoy a warm evening with great people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;NOTE: Sometimes it seems Meetup is not sending e-mail to all those on the list. This issue is not limited to just this Meetup but others have reported it too on occasion. I think sometimes e-mail accounts get blacklisted if e-mail had bounced from it and thus don't get e-mail sent anymore. Please e-mail Kevin (ThorHammer65@yahoo.com) if you think there is a problem in communication. We would love for all those interested to be able to attend the event.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Janice</member_name><member_id>3804430</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1268242399000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>25</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>58</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265655148000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Game Night and Party</name><id>12552385</id><headcount>52</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267916400000</time><rsvp_limit>59</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/12552385/</event_url></item>
