This posh, two floor lounge/club has great DJs and atmosphere.  A fun place to meet new people and to get your groove on!  All members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 9pm in the bar area at Ivy Restaurant (49 Temple Place, which is right across the street from Mantra).  We will head over to Mantra around 10pm to beat the lines.  The line starts to build by 10:30pm, so please meet us before 10pm, as you may not find us later.  Expected cover: $15 usually, but might be free this Friday (please see NOTE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  There is a NYC DJ spinning this Friday, and I've seen flyers stating NO COVER.  This could mean longer lines than usual....  or limited # of no covers.  Even more reason to show up early!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mantra is an upscale venue, so please dress appropriately.  If traveling by T, Mantra is located near the Boylston or Park Street T stops on the green line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
