It is very likely that snowshoes will be required for this hike.  So if you have them bring them.  Some type of secondary traction device is also recommended in case the trail is well packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Nineteen Mile Brook Trailhead and walk a short distance on the road to camp dodge where we will take a short bushwhack to Imp Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total distance will be just over 10 miles.  With a moderate pace there is a good chance we will be coming down in the dark so make sure to bring a headlamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested I will very likely be driving up the previous afternoon (friday) and hiking Moriah at night before driving to Gorham to spend the night in the hostel.  Anyone who is interested in joining me for this just shoot me a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Posted a hike for tripyramids for the previous day so no Moriah atm.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be driving a silver mazda wagon</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263820108000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262233807000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Snowshoeing Middle and South Carter</name><id>12181909</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263646800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12181909/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/2/global_12429362.jpeg</photo_url></item>
