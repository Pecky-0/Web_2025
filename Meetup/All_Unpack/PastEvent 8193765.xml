According to their website, Plan B offers some great hamburgers and beers!  This should be really fun time!  If you have any questions, please refer to Alina.  Her number is 619-933-9277.  Unfortunately, Plan B does not accept reservations but Alina is going to call them on June 30th during the day to remind them that she is coming with our group and she will arrive a bit early as well.
