&lt;p&gt;Let's go ice skating at Simoni ice skating rink in Cambridge.&amp;nbsp; It's $5.00 to skate, and if you don't have your own skates there is a $4.00 rental fee.&amp;nbsp; We'll meet at 1:00 p.m. in front of the rink or inside if the weather is bad&amp;nbsp; (Sunday pubic skating is 1:00-3:00 p.m. this year.)&amp;nbsp; I've run this event for the past two years and we always gather afterward at the East Side Bar &amp;amp; Grille for food and drink which is close by and delicious.&amp;nbsp; Closest T stop is Lechmere on the green line at First Street, so about a 6 block walk. There are also buses that travel down this street. If you are driving, the rink has a parking lot. It's also located next to Twin City Plaza on McGrath/O'Brien Highway.&amp;nbsp; This is a joint event with the Social Fun Meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if your plans change, please update your RSVP. If you have any questions, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
