My intent is to ease the sometimes jarring dissonance between the warm embrace of Cocoa-Touch/UIKit/Objective-C on the one hand and the extremely low-level OpenGL API. Before we get down in the weeds of development details I will give a brief overview of 3D graphics to provide a richer context for and language-independant understanding of the subject. Along the way I will weave a bit of my personal opinions and philosophy about iPhone which I believe is the most personal, expressive, and transformative digital device ever to exist. Hope to see you there!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backgrounder&lt;br /&gt;Doug Turner is a veteran of Silicon Valley where he spent 8 years as a 3D graphics research scientist at Apple’s renowned Advanced Technology Group. He was a key member of the development team that invented QuicktimeVR interactive panoramic technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug left the Valley and moved on to Scandinavia in the late ‘90‘s where he was immersed in mobile wireless development exploding at the time in centers such as Scandinavia, Japan, and the UK. He was involved in a range of projects for both startups based in Iceland, Denmark, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well as the mobile handset market leader Nokia of Finland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug recently returned to the States where is now based in the Boston area. He is a fulltime iPhone developer focusing on applications that blend 3D, gesture, audio, and spatial awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linkedin: &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/douglassturner" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.linkedin.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twitter: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/dugla" target="_blank"&gt;http://twitter.com/du...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;email: douglass.turner@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Large meeting room on lower level</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258848454000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>iOS Developers &amp; Fanatics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nwiphone</urlname><id>1240376</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>Greater Boston iOS Developers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>40</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252786253000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doug Turner: 3D graphics for iPhone</name><id>11356060</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258675200000</time><rsvp_limit>46</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nwiphone/events/11356060/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/6/global_4989286.jpeg</photo_url></item>
