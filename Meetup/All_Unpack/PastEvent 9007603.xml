One is a new favorite - Landsdowne Bar &amp;amp; Grill, and the other is a classic dancing hot spot - BAR. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We enjoyed the happy hour that we had at Lansdowne, and the food is excellent!  I love dancing, and Bar has a great dance floor.  It has awesome pizza and great drinks (Daphne highly recommends the Macintosh appletini)! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The night starts at 8pm at Lansdowne (179 Crown Street) and we walk to Bar (254 Crown Street) before 10 pm to beat the cover charge and get the 2$ drink specials.  The 2$ drink specials include well drinks and domestic bottled beers.  The drink special runs from 10pm to 11pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and party with me and dance the night away! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PS - Please Drink responsibly (I want you to make it home safely after partying with me).&lt;br /&gt;*No cards or gifts, please...Just hugs!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>203-499-7299 Call me with any questions.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>20</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226367824000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224641291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate Anita's 30th B-Day with Dinner and Dancing!</name><id>9007603</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226192400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9007603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/e/global_5979102.jpeg</photo_url></item>
