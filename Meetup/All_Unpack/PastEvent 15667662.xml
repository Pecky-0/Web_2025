Parents can belay for each other while the younger ones work out on the auto belays, the tread wall and the bouldering cave. BRG is popular with families on a Saturday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're scheduling this late enough to let the kids get back from basketball, hockey or whatever activity that is going on earlier. Please come join me and my son for some fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also going to grab a bite to eat at Tudo Na Brasa in Woburn (414 Main Street Woburn, MA) at around 5:15pm. Join us for Brazilian BBQ after climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else are you going to do on a cold Saturday night with the kids, play Wii?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon,&lt;br /&gt;Douglas&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us in the room with the benches, or if arriving late in the main climbing room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Douglas M.</member_name><member_id>9031252</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293037952000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291739392000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climbing with Kids (changed to 3pm Saturday December 18'th 2010)</name><id>15667662</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292702400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/15667662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/4/global_1323156.jpeg</photo_url></item>
