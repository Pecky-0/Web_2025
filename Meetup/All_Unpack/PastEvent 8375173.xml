We'll have a pot luck where everyone can bring something to eat or drink.  Please post with your RSVP what you will be bringing so that we won't have too much of the same thing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph is going to bring his collection of Italian and French films, and we can choose which films to watch.  We'll start the first film around 6 pm, take a break and then watch the second film around 9 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sinch this meetup is at a private location, only members that have attended at least two meetup events with this group will be given the location of the event.  The details of the location will be e-mailed out before the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224286665000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216563959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Italian/French Movie Night and pot luck</name><id>8375173</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220734800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/8375173/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/3/global_1218899.jpeg</photo_url></item>
