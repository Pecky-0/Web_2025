Currently, Ron Paul is virtually ignored / misrepresented in major media across the board. In addition to contacting our local networks and newspapers, the trend of utilizing alternative mediums will have to be continued. I'd like to have a presentable DVD / CD-ROM ready for the first meeting, along with stickers, buttons and printed materials. I am overwhelmed at how people respond to Dr. Paul and his message, but they've got to hear it first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to meet everyone and see how we can each help the Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign achieve the ultimate goal that we, and the planet, desperately need. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I picked Mitchell's because they were accommodating and right off of I-84 Exit 67 East or West. I wanted to start things at 7:00 p.m. instead of 6:30 p.m., but they close at 8:00 p.m. - and time can fly at meetings like these. Get there when you can and if you can't then maybe next time....&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183242737000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181670881000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Tolland County CT Ron Paul 2008 June Meetup</name><id>5883277</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183069800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/5883277/</event_url></item>
