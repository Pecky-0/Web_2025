I think it's a fun game. In addition to using words in the game, it also encourages talking, so I think it can be a fun way to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do my best to explain any words that you don't understand, but you might also consider bringing whatever bi-lingual dictionary you find most helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please sign up only if you are actually going to come, so I know how many people to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other native English speakers who would like to play and help people with their English are of course also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a sign on the table that says "ESL."  I will also send the number for my mobile phone to anyone who signs up before 5:30PM.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>A</member_name><member_id>8074607</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337602926000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337294510000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>English Word Game</name><id>65252912</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337382000000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/65252912/</event_url></item>
