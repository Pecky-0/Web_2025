I ask  that everyone bring what alcoholic beverage they want to drink, and a food item to share.  I will provide the paper goods, cups, soda and of course my house.  I hope that Steve will be able to bring his Karokee machine like last year we had a blast!!!  Hope to see everyone on that night.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Antoinette </member_name><member_id>5363041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297556218000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
