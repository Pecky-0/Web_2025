How do we keep dogs off the chains and inside with their families, what about caring for feral cats?   What about personal disaster planning...remember the Ice Storm?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me on Saturday, December 1st for another Meet-Up in York County at the Animal Welfare Society in West Kennebunk.   They have graciously agreed to host our event and hopefully their staff and volunteers will join us.   We'll talk about the state of animals in Maine and will focus on the upcoming legislative session and how you can play a part!   Bring your thinking caps and your animal related questions.   Let's make 2008 a banner year for animals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a shout...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196712490000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193944336000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>York County Animal Welfare Meet-Up</name><id>6657302</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196539200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/6657302/</event_url></item>
