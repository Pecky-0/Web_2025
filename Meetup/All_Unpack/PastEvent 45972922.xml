&lt;p&gt;The Hasty Pudding Theatricals have presented their unique brand of student-written theater every year since 1844, the only exceptions being for World Wars I and II. This year, HPT proudly presents its 163rd annual production, HPT 163: Kashmir If You Can. The show remains in its essence a no-holds-barred burlesque, with men playing both the male and female roles. Women are involved in all other aspects of the show, from technical staff, to the band, to authoring and producing the show. With the introduction of the Woman of the Year celebration in 1951, and the Man of the Year in 1967, the Pudding has gained a truly international audience. Despite these factors, the Pudding remains at its heart an organization driven by the enthusiasm and exuberance of its undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharon</member_name><member_id>14141542</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330888861000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325266793000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hasty Pudding Theater "Kashmir If You Can" - Sun. afternoon show</name><id>45972922</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330884000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/45972922/</event_url></item>
