I haven't been able to find a schedule of events through the comp or after-party, but was thinking maybe the weekend of March 22-23 would be a good time to get up there.  That way we can see some of the riders, but I am SURE they will have a good nightlife schedule throughout the Open too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This great idea comes to you curtesy of new member Kirstin&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ay, got to think about that one</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>roy</member_name><member_id>2248271</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224370654000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200954954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>US Open</name><id>7165926</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206226800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/7165926/</event_url></item>
