<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;In May, we're going to do the National Tasting Project. We've done this in June in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim has generously volunteered to host the meeting at her place in Grafton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year it's a fun theme of Rhone-style wines from around the world.  So, we will have some from the Rhone in France, of course, but also from California and Australia.  I will take care of getting the wines for the meeting - selecting from a list provided by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one event where we get to practice our wine scoring and compare ourselves with the entire AWS - or at least the chapters that are participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, a great chance to try something new and learn something about wine while we have fun together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting the results is quite structured so that the AWS can import the data more or less directly and Noel has volunteered to help us with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to another fun evening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
