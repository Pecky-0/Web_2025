<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It is time to start discussing the annual pilgrimage to OSH. Please join me at the Bullock Hangar for some pizza, past OSH pictures, past OSH videos, past OSH stories and this year's trip planning. Information on transportation, housing, air venture tips will be available. A major topic for discussion will be reservations at the FPA lake house. The house and OSH BBQ worked out great last year and we have the house again for this year. This will also be a great opportunity to find a co-pilot if you are looking to fly yourself out there. If you can't make the planning meeting, but would like to make the trip with the group, please let me know. Oh boy, I am getting the chills just writing this!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;220 days to go!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295533172000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292525076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>OSH Planning Meeting</name><id>15751580</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295478000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/15751580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/7/global_20291831.jpeg</photo_url></item>
