We've never had a fly-in to Chatham and I thought it would be a great place to go. We could meet in front of the terminal building at (KFIT) and fly out as a group and enjoy breakfast at The Flying Ace Cafe. The restaurant is located right on the field and they are open Sundays until noon.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not join your group for a fun flight and great meal. Wheels up by 8:30. As always the more the merrier. So bring along your spouse or friend to join you. This should be a very scenic trip!  Don't forget your camera!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KCQX" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238594488000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237432934000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chatham, MA (KCQX)</name><id>9986049</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237725000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/9986049/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/0/global_7742944.jpeg</photo_url></item>
