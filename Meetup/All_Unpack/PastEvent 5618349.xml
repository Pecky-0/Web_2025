A seldom-seen Italian comedy from 1962 gets re-released 40 years later- hmm, must be a good one. The movie starts at 4:10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Mafioso isn't a straight black satire of Sicilian culture so much as a suspenseful near-tragedy leavened by the zesty, irreverent wit that helped define the golden age of Italian comedies&amp;quot; Premiere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The story of Nino Badalamenti (Alberto Sordi), a manager at a Milan Fiat factory who becomes embroiled in a Mafia plot when he visits his family in Sicily, this black-and-white gem takes viewers from Milan to Sicily to New York in a journey that's breathtaking not just geographically but cinematically, taking both a humorous and tough look at the hitherto secret world of organized crime.&amp;quot; The Washington Post&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a complete review: &lt;a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-mafioso26jan26,0,7288620.story" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.calendarli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom will host this movie and will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row at the film's conclusion. Then its off to a local restaurant to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176338535000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175211927000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"The Mafioso", Sunday April 1 at Kendall</name><id>5618349</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175457600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5618349/</event_url></item>
