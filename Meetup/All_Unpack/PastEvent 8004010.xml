This time we are hosting Mother Clare Watts, author of &amp;quot;Giving Birth to God: a Woman's Path to Enlightenment&amp;quot; (which, by the way, is not a book just for women). Mother Clare travels nationally giving seminars on spiritually relevent topics. I have heard her speak many times and can tell you that she is one who knows from experience about the subjects she speaks on, and she will definitely give you some intriguing things to think about. I welcome you all to come hear her and meet her. &lt;br /&gt;   On Thursday evening, May 29, she will be speaking on the subject of Intuition: the Spiritual Sixth Sense. A description of the seminar is below. &lt;br /&gt;   Feel free to email me if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Johanna&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;INTUITION: THE SPIRITUAL SIXTH SENSE&lt;br /&gt;All of us have experienced intuition in both obvious and subtle ways. Intuition is that &amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot; you have that you can't explain, when something just &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot; right and later proves to be true. How is intuition a spiritual sense? Can intuition be developed? What role does intuition play in our lives? Come to this seminar, and learn how you can develop and strengthen your intuition, in order to bring more joy, power, and peace to yourself and those around you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
