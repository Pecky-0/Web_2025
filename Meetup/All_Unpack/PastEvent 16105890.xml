It is right across the street from the theater and I should be there by 5:30, so if anyone is interested, feel free to pop in and grab bite to eat with me.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be outside the theater, near the box office, in line at 6:30.   We will head in for seats as soon as they let us, probably around 6:45.    The program begins at 7.  I will have a meetup pin and a meetup sign.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions and Parking to Coolidge Corner Theater: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coolidge.org/map" target="_blank"&gt;http://coolidge.org/m...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science On Screen @ the Coolidge Corner Theater &lt;br /&gt;With Science on Screen, we present a feature film or documentary with a basis in science or technology, paired with a compelling presentation by a top-notch scientist, inventor, or medical expert.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science on Screen programs are $9.75 regular admission, or $7.75 for seniors, students, and Museum of Science members.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Buy Tickets:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coolidge.org/showtimes" target="_blank"&gt;http://coolidge.org/s...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note, these shows are quite popular and do tend to sell out, so I strongly advise you to purchase your ticket in advance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;Science On Screen: TRANSCENDENT MAN  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mon, Mar 21 @ 7:00 pm, with inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil and director Barry Ptolemy &lt;br /&gt;“Kurzweil is the best person I know at predicting the future. Kurzweil envisions a (time) in which information technologies have advanced so far and fast that they enable humanity to transcend its biological limitations – transforming our lives in ways we can’t yet imagine.” – Bill Gates &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filmmaker Barry Ptolemy’s compelling documentary explores the life and provocative ideas of renowned techno-prophet Ray Kurzweil. Inspired by Kurzweil’s bestselling book The Singularity is Near, Transcendent Man follows Kurzweil around the globe as he shares his daring vision of a future in which we merge with our machines and vastly extend our longevity and intelligence, all within the next 30 years. The film explores the social and philosophical implications of Kurzweil’s mind-bending predictions through conversations with former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, technologists Peter Diamandis, Neil Gershenfeld, and Dean Kamen, journalists Tom Abate and Kevin Kelly, and others. Called one of the top ten documentaries of the year by the International Documentary Association, Transcendent Man had its world premiere at the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Kurzweil will share some of his ideas about the future in an introduction before the film and will join with director Barry Ptolemy for Question and answer session, after the screening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Ray Kurzweil &lt;br /&gt;Ray Kurzweil is one of the world’s leading futurists, with a 20-year track record of accurate predictions. Called the “restless genius” by The Wall Street Journal and the “ultimate thinking machine” by Forbes magazine, Kurzweil was selected as one of the top entrepreneurs by Inc. magazine, which described him as the “rightful heir to Thomas Edison.” He is the inventor of the first CCD flatbed scanner, the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and many other technological firsts. Kurzweil was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and has received the National Medal of Technology, the Lemelson-MIT Prize for innovation, 19 honorary doctorates, and awards from three U.S. presidents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a lecture, movie and a question and answer session, I am not sure how late this event will run.   Not really planning on doing something after, but if it isn't too late, perhaps we could grab a drink at a nearby establishment.   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be outside the box office in line at 6:30 wearing a meetup pin and carrying a meetup sign till they let us into the building.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300802872000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295449645000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Transcendent Man with Ray Kurzweil &amp; director Barry Ptolemy</name><id>16105890</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300746600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/16105890/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/4/global_20910916.jpeg</photo_url></item>
