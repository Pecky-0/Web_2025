Over the Top... Rock Climbing Competition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can bribe the judges.  We will hold these informal - very low key competitions - at Metro Rock starting at 11AM.  If you win, you will get a free frozen turkey - or a frozen squash if you are a vegetarian.  If you don't want to cook it, you can cook it at my place later in the day.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Categories of the extreme:  1) most silly climber, 2) fastest climber 3) fastest newbie 4) hardest bouldering stuff 5) easiest climb that looked the hardest, AND 6) best climb and Yo-Yo er...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People should sign up now to be judges or sign up later or on the spot.  People should bring their pot-luck for eating later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New climbers are welcome - make sure you contact Metro Rock before hand if you need a class or need to be belay tested.  Look up Metro Rock's website for detailed directions to this nice gym.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 Dollar suggest donation to me for paying for this site and loosing top-roping equipment.  (Yea, I know you gota pay the Metro Rock guys 2 but hey...)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you have any questions,&lt;br /&gt;Geoff&lt;br /&gt;617 501-6217&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197389095000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195444353000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock Climbing Competition</name><id>6767528</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197216000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/6767528/</event_url></item>
