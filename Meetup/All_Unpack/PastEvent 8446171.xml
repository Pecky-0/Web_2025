Let's do this - hit MetroRock and climb! You'll start the week off right. So good in fact that you'll feel absolutely giddy by mid-week - guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be at the picnic table until 7:30; after that, you'll find me climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newbies are always welcome but you will need to pass a belay test. MetroRock charges $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. There's a shuttle from the Orange Line Wellington station if you're coming straight from work.
