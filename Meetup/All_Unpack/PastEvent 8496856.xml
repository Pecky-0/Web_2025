Some interesting spots are the Theatre, the bowling alley, the bars and coffee shops, all offer tidbits of urban and retro imagery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 8:45PM and spend an hour or so walking the streets, grab a coffee and look for unique bits of cambridge to capture, we can stay out longer if you like, but I know it's a &amp;quot;school night&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for folks with tripods</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219280106000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218122093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Night Shoot in Davis Square</name><id>8496856</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219106700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8496856/</event_url></item>
