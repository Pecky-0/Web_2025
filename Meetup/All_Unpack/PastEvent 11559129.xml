<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We've been doing mostly overnight trips so I figured its time for a local hike. We'll head out to Long and Ell ponds in Rockville, which is the southwestern corner of the state. Its a 4.5 mile hike that should take around 3 hours. There are some minor elevation changes and rocky terrain so you should be in reasonable shape although we'll take our time so slower hikers are welcome. The path is the southern terminus of the Narragansett Trail and includes rocky overlooks over the ponds and a decent through a gorge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring some water and a snack if desired and some sturdy footwear. We'll meet at the trail head at 9 AM but those that wish to carpool can meet at the commuter lot at the junction of 138 and 1A (just over the jamestown bridge) at 8AM. Let me know which when you sign up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that wish to meet at the trail head here are the directions:&lt;br /&gt;Follow 138 to village of Rockville near the Connecticut line, turn left onto Wincheck Pond Road, then left onto Canonchet Road. Drive .5 miles to North Road and follow it 1 mile, it becomes gravel after half a mile. Park on the left where you will see a sign and the yellow AMC trail blazes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be a perfect Fall morning and its supposed to be a beautiful hike (my first time too!), so we'll see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255352891000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254798370000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Long Pond - Ell Pond  Local Hike</name><id>11559129</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255179600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11559129/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/f/1/global_11086849.jpeg</photo_url></item>
