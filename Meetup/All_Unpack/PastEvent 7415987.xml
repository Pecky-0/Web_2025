Snacks will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend that all participants start by consulting the website of the Asperger's Association of New England (www.aane.org), based in Watertown, for suggestions and advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Snacks will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Note that I myself (the organizer) may be able to provide an unusual perspective.  I am a self-diagnosed Aspie who has managed to overcome the disability enough to hold a full-time software engineering job, live alone, and find a girlfriend.  One thing I suggest is use special interests in a way which will benefit you and society as a whole.  Furthermore, never stop learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As a wise old Aspie math geek once wrote in high school, &amp;quot;all these mathematical theories are useless when I try to figure out why I am in love.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This preliminary meeting will be at my apartment.
