We play a wide range of music, from our specialty, Hebrew and Israeli music, all the way to classic Sinatra, Broadway and great rock and roll. In short, we'll have lots of fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come out and support Hal in his only public performances of the year. See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon, Aug. 12th 7:00-8:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;MEMORIAL PARK BEACH&lt;br /&gt;Beach Street (off Pond Street)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  RT 95S ( off 128 ) Take exit 10 amd follow to center of town.
