They're craft beer list is impressive and their pizza is outstanding. It's made in their wood-fire brick oven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll sit down for a late lunch/early dinner and share some pie. (There are vegetarian options, too.) And with our pie, we will, of course, have beer! After all, it's the perfect combo. You'll be wowed by the craft beer menu at this charming little place. From taps to bottles, this place &amp;quot;gets&amp;quot; craft beer. And lucky for us, we'll get to pair craft beer with -- dare I say? -- the best pizza you'll find in Boston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's more, dessert is FREE.&lt;/b&gt; And it's made with beer. No joke. Picco is graciously serving up  their COW TIPPER FRAPPE. It's Left Hand Milk Stout beer blended with vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream. Drooling yet? Yeah, you won't want to miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara B from Yelp says, &amp;quot;With a carefully selected beer and wine list that pairs well with the food, it's a great place to sit back with a draft and a slice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's just what we're going to do! &lt;b&gt;So please RSVP early, because seating is VERY limited.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We have a reservation. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alicia</member_name><member_id>8353321</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1271110074000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>beer buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CraftBeerCrew</urlname><id>1469154</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Craft Beer Crew</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269189511000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pizza &amp; Beer: The Perfect Combo</name><id>12946879</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270922400000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CraftBeerCrew/events/12946879/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/e/9/global_13798073.jpeg</photo_url></item>
