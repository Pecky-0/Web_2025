HISTORY can tell you facts about a people, but MYTHOLOGY shows you the personality, their beliefs, fears, and hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been said &amp;ldquo;One people&amp;rsquo;s Religion becomes the next people&amp;rsquo;s Mythology&amp;rdquo;. Myths began as religious stories, and many of them prominently feature gods and goddesses.  While society as a whole may overlook their spiritual significance, there is much we can still learn about ourselves through this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read myths from other cultures, it also causes you to think of your own culture.  What stories are we leaving behind for generations to come?  What do we value?  What mark are we leaving on an ever-changing world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class begins at 6PM with Open Circle starting at 7:30PM&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303149776000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297354527000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Introduction to Mythology 1</name><id>16516974</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303077600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/16516974/</event_url></item>
