I've known Joe for over a year now.  He's a true conservative - promoting limited government and personal freedoms, and his legislative record has proven this in the past.  Joe was instrumental in organizing the &amp;quot;Axe the Tax&amp;quot; rally in Hartford in 1991 and is now a leading advocate for the conservative coalition in CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe says:&lt;br /&gt;A large turnout would be a terrific boost.  We have a good program shaping up, with both tea party folks (including Tanya) and political friends (like Tom Scott and Dick Bozzuto).  I hope you will plan on joining me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!
