Suddenly she is a Sassenach -- an &amp;quot;outlander&amp;quot; -- in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of our Lord...1743.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire's destiny is soon inextricably intertwined with Clan MacKenzie and the forbidding Castle Leoch. She is catapulted without warning into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life...and shatter her heart. For here, James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a passion so fierce and a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire...and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://bfgb.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/outlander.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the table closest to the cafe door.
