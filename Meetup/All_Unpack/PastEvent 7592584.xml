They hoped to flood the enemy economy and fill the empty war coffers. At the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, two barracks were transformed into a fully equipped counterfeiters workshop. &amp;quot;Operation Bernhard&amp;quot; was born. Prisoners were brought to Sachsenhausen from other camps: professional printers, fastidious bank officials and simple craftsmen all became members of the top-secret counterfeiter commando. If they cooperated with the enemy, they had a chance to survive; if they sabotaged the operation, a sure death awaited them. Based on a true story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, here's the movie's website. &lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/thecounterfeiters" target="_blank"&gt;The Counterfeiters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/thecounterfeiters_109866/criticreviews" target="_blank"&gt;L.A.
