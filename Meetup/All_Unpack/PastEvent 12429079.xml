I attended her party last year and it was a blast. So plan on joining us if you can. She is in Hamden...address will be disclosed to attendees. BTW...there will be folks from other groups, so come meet some new people and perhaps a special &amp;quot;valentine&amp;quot;! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read on from Antoinette... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning another Valentine's Day Party at my house on Friday, February 12, 2010. Please bring an appetizer or some food to share with everyone. BYOB. I will provide my house, plates, cups, etc. I want Steve C. to bring his Karokee machine. I think it will be fun to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear your red and plan on having a good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone there!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antoinette&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Location to be disclosed to attendees...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Antoinette </member_name><member_id>5363041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266192844000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264528440000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Valentine Party @ Antoinette's!!! </name><id>12429079</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266019200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/12429079/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/9/global_12813417.jpeg</photo_url></item>
