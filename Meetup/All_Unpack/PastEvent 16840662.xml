&lt;p&gt;Turtle Lane has formally scheduled us as a group, so I've removed the attendance cap.&amp;nbsp; Parking is somewhat tight, so carpool where possible -- post where you're driving from and how many you can take.&amp;nbsp; There is no easy public transit to this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, nearby restaurants have had dishes made with Turtle Lane syrup.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if that's the case this year, but if it is, there may be a lunch run to one of those restaurants afterward.&amp;nbsp; Last year's restaurants included The Loft and Mad Maggie's Ice Cream, both in North Andover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turtle Lane hasn't announced they're boiling yet, but the weather  all week looks about perfect for sap running, so I expect they'll be  boiling the entire weekend.&amp;nbsp; I'll send out updates if they won't be boiling at  the scheduled time.&lt;/p&gt;
