Join us as we check out indoor skydiving at SkyVenture in Nashua. Here is more info below- it looks like an awesome experience and safe too! Please check their website for additional information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a State of the Art Vertical Wind Tunnel where YOU can experience the FREEDOM OF FLIGHT! There is NO falling sensation, you just float above the trampoline floor with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indoor vertical wind tunnel is not only used by the worldâ€™s best skydivers to train in but it was also designed for the general public to experience the sport of body flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SkyVenture completely immerses visitors in the world of high adventure skydiving, without ever having to pack a parachute, pull a ripcord, or jump out of a perfectly good airplane. NO Experience Necessary! Virtually anyone can fly ages 3 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is $48. Each member is responsible for their own payment. I will make reservations for our group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great to carpool, so please indicate in your RSVP if you would like to carpool.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo) inside ent.
