As in previous years we will be having the Australia Day celebrations at Magazine St Beach in Cambridge anytime from 12noon onwards. This has worked well in the past as it T-accessible from both the red and green lines and also has a car park. A Trader Joes is located right across the street which stocks beer and wine - so for those of you who are coming by public transport this makes it easy to pick up your food/beer and wine and not have to lug it with you. There is also a whole foods just a couple of streets away. The set-up that has worked well for us in the past is everybody being responsible for their own meat and booze and then we usually share condiments/salads etc.. When you RSVP if you could indicate whether it is possible for you to bring a portable BBQ , esky, cricket set etc - that will help with the planning. I plan on arriving a little bit early to stake out a picnic table and a nice shady area and get things set-up. This is a family suitable event - so people with kids please feel free to bring them along. We have not had any problems drinking at the park in the past, but just to be safe we have used plastic cups in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abhi</member_name><member_id>7650698</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1314548530000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310140141000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Aussie Day Celebrations</name><id>25027251</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1314459000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/25027251/</event_url></item>
