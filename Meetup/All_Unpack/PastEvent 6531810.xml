Another weekend Bookcrossing event is on the schedule!  If you've always wanted to attend a BookCrossing event but just couldn't make it into the city on a Tuesday night, now is your chance to join us for some bookish conversation on a Sunday afternoon.  Bring bookcrossing books to give away, or just come as you are for book-talk and general literary good times.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This suburban locate is easily accessible from route 95, route 3, route 93, and via the 350 bus from Alewife.  Note this meetup is at 2:30, a half hour later than the last one, to accommodate the Sunday bus schedule.  As always, feel free to contact your Fearless Leader with any questions or comments.  We hope to see you there!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194377832000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192131942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Suburban Sunday Bookcrossing Meetup</name><id>6531810</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194204600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/6531810/</event_url></item>
