Don't think we've ever just sat around and told lies about our flying abilities. We can meet at Bullocks Hangar, order some pizzas and ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mark Estabrook and Matt Scales Have been asking for something like this. Some topics could be, " what would happen if..." , or, " has anyone ever really...", then the question I get all the time, " did you really...".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could get into IFR stuff too and discuss things like, " isn't that approach a ...", or the ever popular, " if you're in and out of the clouds alot, doesn't that...".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Course, bring your own topics too. " ever been scared doing that", or "as a student pilot, that always scared me big time".. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You all get my wind correction...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All welcome, from ATP to Maybe I'll Be A Student Soon. Charley, Matt and Mark!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336059253000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335616951000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hangar flying for us Dummies aka "did you ever wonder..."</name><id>62502162</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335994200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/62502162/</event_url></item>
