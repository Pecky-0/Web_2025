<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello, friends,&lt;br /&gt;   Let's get together on Wednesday night to get to know each other. This will be a pretty relaxed format. We can spend some time finding out about each other in general, and especially what people's interests in meditation and inner spirituality are. I will also lead a group guided meditation so we can have that experience together, and we can have time to talk about it afterward. Come with questions about meditation or spiritual life. Come to experience the support of meditating in a group setting. Come to meet other people who are seeking, like you are, to increase their inner peace and find more meaning in life through meditation. We have quite a few new members, so come on over and meet some interesting people and do something meaningful. If anyone has any questions, feel free to contact me through the meetup website. I'm looking forward to meeting you all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
