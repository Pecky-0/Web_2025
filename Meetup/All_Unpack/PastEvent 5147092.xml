<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>(Southwestern CT) A 3.2 mile hike passing by Pierrepont Lake and includes a loop with a senic view. A wonderful way to endt the day on this first weekend of Fall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The State Park is touted as haing many different habitats and excellent overlooks on the trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area at the main entrance (near the lake, see the park map) by 4:30 PM. There is no fee for parking. The hike is anticipated to take about 2 hours at an easy pace and should be done by about 6:30 PM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided. The hike will follow the White blaze trail out to the Blue trail (in counter-clockwise loop), then a piece of the White trail again up to the Yellow trail. Then down to the White trail and back to the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;)  is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map for parking and trails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/maps/pierrepont.pdf"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** No parking or park fee **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions...&lt;br /&gt;From I-84:&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 3 (Route 7 Exit)&lt;br /&gt;* Go south on Route 7, bear right onto Route 35 south&lt;br /&gt;* Follow Route 35 to Route 116 north (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Ridgefield:&lt;br /&gt;* Go north onto Route 116 for 2.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right onto Barlow Mountain Road, which brings you right into Seth Low Pierrepont State Park Reserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETS:&lt;br /&gt;Pets on a leash are permitted in picnic areas and on hiking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/reserves/sethlow.htm"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/reserves/sethlow.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159626204000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158966821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kevin's Hike at Seth Low Pierrepont SP Reserve in Ridgefield CT</name><id>5147092</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1159129800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5147092/</event_url></item>
