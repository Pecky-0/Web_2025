He moved to Taiwan and became established as one of their leading directors during the 1990's.&amp;quot;Even today,&amp;quot; says Tsai, &amp;quot;I feel I belong neither to Taiwan nor to Malaysia. In a sense, I can go anywhere I want and fit in, but I never feel that sense of belonging.&amp;quot; The  urbanization of our planet and its subsequent alienation is a theme throughout his works. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The streets of Kuala Lumpur teem with life. The crowded, humid streets are full of food stalls and shops where the native born and foreign workers scurry about attending to their business as scam artists try to entice them into parting with their money. Away from the city center, though, among squalid tenements and half-built, apparently never-to-be-finished modernistic buildings, it is quieter and lonely. It is in these spaces that three people seek companionship, love, and solace in I Don't Want to Sleep Alone&amp;quot; Reel.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It?s hard to judge the works of Malaysian director Tsai (who typically works in Taiwan) with reference to typical cinematic constructs like plot, pacing and character development. Watching a Tsai film is a lot more like staring at a painting for a really long time than hearing a story, and if your mind wanders while taking in his long, static takes, then part of the movie-going experience is appreciating where that takes you. For those who value film on a purely aesthetic level, a Tsai film is something of a gift, and his latest, I Don?t Want to Sleep Alone, is no exception.  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Explaining the plot is almost beside the point, since like the rest of Tsai?s work, Sleep features virtually no dialogue and nothing you could really call exposition. There is definitely a Taiwanese man (Lee, a Tsai regular) wandering the streets of Kuala Lumpur, who is beaten up by a band of thieves and rescued by another itinerant (Atun). The rescuer seems to have an erotic or romantic obsession with his charge, who also forms a bond with a waitress (Chen). She in turn is taking care of a catatonic man (Lee again), who may or may not be her brother. I think.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appeal here is in Tsai?s beautifully crafted images and the small moments that add up to a touching portrait of finding simple human connections in an unfeeling urban environment. It takes some careful attention and a not insignificant amount of patience, but if you can modify your expectations accordingly, Sleep is a highly rewarding experience. &amp;quot;  Las Vegas Weekly (never thought I'd be quoting from here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've only seen one of Tsai's films- the post-apocalyptic musical, &amp;quot;The Hole&amp;quot; and have been looking forward to seeing more of his work. I will mention that  the pace of this film appears to be  somewhat slow and may prove tedious to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as is our custom, I'll be holding a Meetup sign near the front row at the movie's end and then its off to a local restaurant to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190058455000</updated><rating><average>3.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188784407000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I Don't Want to Sleep Alone- A Malaysian Film</name><id>6287599</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189885500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6287599/</event_url></item>
