Tonight is a chance to meet singles and also just hang out at Herb’s studio.  The suggested cost is $10.00 but no one is turned away because of money, so pay what you can honestly afford.  Here is a description of the party from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A party for singles. Bring your friends. I'll be available to type people, answer your Enneagram or other typing system questions. I plan on having name tags with people types on them so you can ask questions to each other about your similarities and differences. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet someone special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Party goes from 6 to 11pm. Show up anytime. I'll provide some vegetarian snacks and dishes. It's a vegetarian potluck party so bring only vegetarian dishes or snacks if you want to bring something, though it's not a requirement to bring anything but yourself. Bring drinks if you want, including wine.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.herbpearce.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247787181000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247023056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Singles Enneagram Party</name><id>10827559</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247349600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/10827559/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/4/global_7019412.jpeg</photo_url></item>
