Unfortunately that means there's no guarantee of a seat tomorrow as they're all filled. Sorry about the last minute disappointment but I was just informed. Jim Azzola (800)604-1256&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet The Candidates and Raise Some Money for the Wounded Warrior Project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, November 8, 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00pm – 9:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Venue as of 10-15-09  -  Vazzy’s in Bridgeport – please spread the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete directions and a map are attached.  Vazzy’s is on the Bridgeport/ Trumbull border near Routes 8 and 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apologies for the change in venue but the Sports Center wasn’t able to accommodate our expanding list of attendees.  Vazzy’s is perfect.  We’ve arranged for appetizers during the candidate presentations, dinner and there’s a cash bar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right Principles is organizing this event to meet candidates from several Congressional districts plus the Senate.  This will be a productive networking dinner and an opportunity to help the Wounded Warrior Project.  Personally vet the candidates and have your questions answered.  Demonstrate to the candidates that our grassroots groups are a force to be reckoned with in the coming election cycle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the opportunity to network with folks from 15 or more freedom-loving grassroots groups that have been invited.  T he donation at the door will be $25.  T here will be dinner and refreshments, and half the door money will go to Wounded Warriors.  A n opportunity to make an additional contribution will also be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our networking meet-ups have been productive – there are always plenty of folks sharing best practices from their communities in organizing and getting the word out.  W e will also be sharing some ideas on organizing for electoral impact as the 2010 election cycle gets underway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please join us – and if you do intend to be there please give a quick e-mail to bobmac@rightprinciples.com so we’ll have an idea of attendance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257890890000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256260783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Peter Schiff at Right Principle's Meeting in Bridgeport</name><id>11690979</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257717600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/11690979/</event_url></item>
