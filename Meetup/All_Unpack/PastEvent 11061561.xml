Long after the Pilgrims first broke bread with the Native Americans many new immigrants have been bringing their food and culture to the shores of the Boston Harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing To Do Boston leads you through a culinary Amazing Race full of adventure, new experiences and new tastes.  Teams will hit Boston and the surrounding neighborhoods, following clues and completing challenges (and yes, indulging in good food and drink along the way!) to race to the finish.  At the end we will all celebrate our experience by sharing our photos and videos and teams will be awarded prizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who:&lt;/b&gt; Sign up as a team or as an individual and we will join you with others.  Each team must have a digital camera along with the cord to download the photos.  Donâ€™t forget to bring your adventuresome, competitive spirit along with your appetite!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested Attire:&lt;/b&gt; Comfortable clothes- be prepared for weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; Teams will meet and organize at 12:00pm sharp outside the Boston Common Information Kiosk-(Tremont St., where the Freedom Trail begins, right behind Park Street Station.) The rest of the hunt will unfold from there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost:&lt;/b&gt; $25.00&lt;br /&gt;Each team member should also have some spending money to complete the tasks along the way- but for all you savers out there you should be able to apply your creative genius to save yourselves some dough!&lt;br /&gt;sharp at the information kiosk behind the Park Street T station.  The rest of the hunt will unfold from there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up at&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.thingstodoboston.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.thingstodoboston.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leah</member_name><member_id>8965438</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254594589000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1382</urlname><id>1275022</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Things To Do: BOSTON</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249687732000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Culinary Amazing Race- Eat Your Way Through Boston!</name><id>11061561</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253376000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1382/events/11061561/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/9/global_5450809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
