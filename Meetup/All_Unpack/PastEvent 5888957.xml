Plan to meet in the parking lot at &lt;a href="http://www.northwestpark.org" target="_blank"&gt;Northwest Park&lt;/a&gt; on Lang Road in Windsor at 5:45 PM.  We'll start walking promptly at 6:00.  Northwest Park has several miles of relatively easy trails -- we'll make sure to spend some time on the one overlooking Rainbow Reservoir.  Leashed dogs are welcome.  Good pizza at the Italian Corner on Route 75 if anyone wants to head there afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain plans -- Light rain, we'll still go, heavy rain or lightning cancels and we'll reschedule for another evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
