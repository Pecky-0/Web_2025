Keep checking back for more details. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;We will leave Vegas at 10:10 pm on June 15th and arrive back in Boston at 6:14 am (Tuesday June 16th)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price includes air / hotel / transfers and a cancellation waiver and is currently around $571.00 per person for double occupancy.  The price may vary slightly based when you book your trip. We originally were going to go with a &amp;quot;group trip&amp;quot; but some of the details didn't work so we are going to be booking this trip in pairs.  If you have a roommate in mind let me know otherwise we will assigning roommates as people sign up.  If we need to switch people around we can work something out.....besides we won't be spending much time in our room anyhow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that flights do fill up so you want to book your trip early.  Since we will be booking individually people can also leave and come back on a schedule that works for you just talk to Tara about the changes you want to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to have a single room the price will be appx $790.00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have responded yes to this Event you will need to contact the Travel Agent directly to arrange for payment to reserve your space.  I will allow the space to be reserved without payment until all spaces are filled.  Once that happens anyone who has not paid will be moved to a &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; status to allow for others to respond yes and pay for the trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara Dillberg &lt;br /&gt;1-800-749-9691  (tell her you are booking a spot in the Fun Singles trip to Vegas or mention my name) &lt;br /&gt;She can be reached 9:00-5:30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone will need fill out a reservation form for Garber Travel.  It is available in the Files section of the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So reserve early and join us for a long weekend of cutting loose and remember.....what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judie</member_name><member_id>5431837</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130670000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240763547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TFS is invading Vegas in June!</name><id>10270200</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244804400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/10270200/</event_url></item>
