(That way you have choices!)  We will work on foundational principles and apply them in the 18 Essentials form. At his last visit, Grandmaster Chen gave us excellent details about this wonderful form which will inform our work together. If you have never studied Chen Style or if you would like to refresh or deepen your knowledge of the basics, this is the group for you.&lt;br /&gt;This group will meet every week until Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>As you face Wadsworth village, take the driveway on the far right.
