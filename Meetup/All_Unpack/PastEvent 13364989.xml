The connection that people have is a neccessary to survival in this tough economy.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proximity &amp;amp; Familiarity &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies by Stanford University social psychologists Leon Festinger and Robert Zajonc and others conclude that simply being around someone tends to produce positive feelings.  In the old days I would “stalk” my targets – in a good way – by following them around to different conferences and always being there to speak to them, before they went on stage.  If you can’t be with the person physically, then connecting with them and engaging them via social media is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathleen A Bowman </member_name><member_id>7213289</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274667047000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>businessnetwork-784</urlname><id>1149510</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9300003052</group_lon><name>Business networking and social meeting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272875772000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's connect  for a better future </name><id>13364989</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274655600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/businessnetwork-784/events/13364989/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/7/6/global_13559238.jpeg</photo_url></item>
