Hooray!! For many people, the BH is listed as one of their favorite dining spots in the Valley. We are very excited because they have agreed to let us sit in the main dining room, so we will be right in the middle of the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the restaurant's philosophy, which is right in keeping with the mission of this EatUp!:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Blue Heron is committed daily to the rich traditions of farm to table and to participating and maintaining a strong agricultural and economic community. We know that a strong community and access to sustainably raised food are the roots of our survival. We believe strongly that we must play an active role in the stewardship of our planet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Currently much of our landscape is dotted with chain fast food restaurants and multinational food establishments. But here in the Connecticut River Valley much of our landscape is also dotted with small family farms. We are lucky because we can choose to stay connected to the source of much of what we eat. Whenever possible, we purchase seasonal, sustainably raised, locally and regionally farmed products without the use of antibiotics, hormones and genetically modified ingredients; and limited or no use of herbicides and pesticides. We spend our dollars purchasing from local and regional small farms committed to sustainable farming practices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meats are pasture raised and grass fed with no hormones or antibiotics. Often, we buy whole animals and use all of the various cuts of meat for our menu. If we cannot supply our menu with a local product, then we purchase from farms and ranches that continue sustainable practices. Our meats are not purchased from large multinational industrial corporate farms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In season our produce comes from local farms, and in the winter our apples, potatoes and other root vegetables come from local family farms.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, we are doing things a bit differently, as per the restaurant's request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, because of their higher price range, we will need to increase the prepaid amount to $41.00, which, as usual, includes appetizers, three courses, tax &amp;amp; gratuity. As before, any beverages will be your own responsibility, including the gratuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Heron also would like us to pre-order our entrees, so when you register, you will be given three options, please choose one. You can change your mind all the way up to the 5th of April, when we will be letting them know our choices.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will be the ones laughing the loudest</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271798990000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>food lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Western-Mass-Eat-Up</urlname><id>1464899</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western Mass Eat-Up!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269022956000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Heron- April 15th, 2010</name><id>12934086</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271368800000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Western-Mass-Eat-Up/events/12934086/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/global_13752331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
