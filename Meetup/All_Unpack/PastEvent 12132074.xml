Buy your own ticket, and call me if you are planning to come!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the people who are still stuck in Boston during vacations (like me).. and haven't yet seen this movie.. lets plan to see this on 24th. There is a 1:45pm show in IMAX theatre at Reading (a 20 minute drive from boston). We can carpool, looks like lot of people have cars, so those who don't should have a problem getting a ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP soon, so that we can buy tickets in advance... last weekend all IMAX theaters were sold out! And IMAX 3D is better than 'Digital 3D' in regular theaters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this gets sold out, we can plan for Boston Commons AMC theater (digital 3d).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>call me @ 631-943-4296</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261799862000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261501625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie - Avatar</name><id>12132074</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261626300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/12132074/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
