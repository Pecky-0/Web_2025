This movement takes a variety of forms. One form is the sensation of fast movement of the Soul body through the planes of time and space. In reality, though, is such movement possible? Soul exists on all planes, so what feels like movement, or travel, is simply Soul coming into an agreement with fixed states and conditions that already exist in some world of time and space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A contemplative may hear a rushing sound, like a wailing wind in a tunnel, along with a sensation of incredible speed. But as explained, Soul doesn't move; Soul &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Time and space adjust to Soul's state of consciousness, and it is this adjustment of time and space that renders an illusion of movement or breathtaking speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soul Travel is for the bold and courageous in spirit. But remember, since one doesn't in fact travel anywhere, it's impossible to get lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keep that principle in mind during a spiritual exercise. It will lend the confidence to open your heart to love and so delight in any enlightenment that finds you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another form of Soul Travel is the expansion of consciousness. This aspect is the true state of personal revelation or enlightenment. It visits both the timid and the bold and is a gentler, less robust version of movement in consciousness. Most people experience this sort of gradual shifting of awareness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this meetup we'll talk about the various types of Soul Travel experiences that are possible and share some techniques that may allow you to experience Soul Travel for yourself! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
