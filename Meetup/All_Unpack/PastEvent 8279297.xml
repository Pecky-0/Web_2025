It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it.&amp;quot; - Roger Ebert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, indeed, the Warners here have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap.&amp;quot; - Bosley Crowther, New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Across seven decades, the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman starrer has emerged as Americans' default favorite movie.&amp;quot;  - Douglas Pratt, Hollywood Reporter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of you know the plot of Casablanca. In fact most of you, unlike me, have seen Casablanca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just in case, I'll write a brief synopsis. Casablanca is a love story set in World War II Morocco. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, an American who runs a cafe that becomes a gathering place for everyone in the city. Rick's long lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) appears in Casablanca with her Resistance leader husband Victor, thus pulling Rick into a love triangle and a web of political intrigue. Ilsa and Victor need to get out of Casablanca and Rick is the only one who can help him. But will he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is being screened as part of the Coolidge's outdoor film series. Please bring a blanket or chair to sit on and food/drink to share with the group. The film starts at 8, but I've set the meeting time to 7 so everyone can get settled and acquainted before the movie. Due to the late ending time, we will not have a post movie discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have red balloons set out next to the blanket where I'm sitting.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole</member_name><member_id>3185465</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217201623000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215231194000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casablanca Under the Stars</name><id>8279297</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216335600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8279297/</event_url></item>
