Wassup!!! Wassup!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Incubators!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its time to get that smile back again right in time for the holidays.  This Friday night will more than likely be the last actual Incubator for the year!  We might throw a little post x-mas pre new year's socializing event though, any ideas or thoughts??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the lack of Thursday, Friday was the only day available. (No worries for the new year though, we have Thursdays booked up for January, except new year's day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's laugh it out in style.  We'll be doing some crazy games as usual and then catching up at I think what has become our Friday spot...IHOP!!!   Though I guess I can still be swayed to going to UNOs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions or concerns let me know.  Sorry it took so long to get this up and rocking but I just had to wait for confirmation from our sweet incubating space.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catcha on Friday!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll open the doors for all my lovely folk</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230688231000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229526892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Incubator's Back &amp; Its Better Than Ever...Hey la day La The Incubator's Back</name><id>9352529</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229733000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/9352529/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
