<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Metro West Humane Society's Annual Craft Fair will take place Saturday Sept. 12 on the Framingham Center Common from 10am-4pm rain or shine. There will be over 70 local venders! Too many to put down on paper. They are  a non-profit volunteer organization, located in Ashland, sevicing MetroWest and surrounding areas. They are a no-kill cat shelter. The address is right just ignore the #15. I need an exact address and I don't think the common has one. It is on Edgell Rd. and next to rt. 9 in Framingham center. You can call Sandy at 508-485-4566 or e-mail sbryer@bentley.edu if you have any questions. I will be there at 10am as I have other plans in the afternoon. Hope to see some of you there. This will be hopefully booked on 3 sites!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look around</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 6874991</member_name><member_id>6874991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252937832000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gay Women Over 40</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>lgbtfriends-212</urlname><id>1155810</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>WEST OF BOSTON OVER 40 GAY WOMENS MEET-UP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250685676000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>3rd Annual Metro West Humane Society</name><id>11146832</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252764000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lgbtfriends-212/events/11146832/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/0/global_4210720.jpeg</photo_url></item>
