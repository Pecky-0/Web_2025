We facilitate and promote networking and collaboration among innovators, investors and supporters from all around New England and beyond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We showcase what's new and cool with startups and technology from the Boston area. Our presenters demonstrate their technology and then take questions from the audience. Network with the Boston startup community, including executives, marketers, designers, developers and technology enthusiasts! Our free events usually offer dinner and beverages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;See local startups and associated hacker types in action! Marvel at the latest in cool technology! Watch some slide decks and pass around a mic to ask questions!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We mostly showcase early stage companies as presenters, but sometimes have more established companies with new tech products. We're aiming to give them exposure and traction to a tech-savvy public, as well as potential clients, employees, or even investors. We'd also like to encourage community-building among local tech practitioners and provide inspiration and networking opportunities in a fun and informal way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have 3,700+ members who are primarily Boston-area professionals of all ages, with most between 22 and 50 years old. Most members are entrepreneurs, startup employees and others who work in technology and/or provide services to technology companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We seek sponsors and presenters!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
