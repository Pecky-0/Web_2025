(about 10 miles) If you have never biked the drive before, it is scenically beautiful.  Bring warm clothing because it can be windy at night.  Helmets are recommended.  All levels of bikers are welcome.  Remember to bring a lock for your bike if you are going to have dinner with us later.&lt;br /&gt;Flo's is a wonderful, small seafood restaurant, that serves beer and wine upstairs, as well as various seafood dishes and a raw bar. It is across from the ocean with great views.  If you do not want to bike, but would like to join us for dinner, we should be there by 7:30 at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in Easton's Beach parking lot near the playground for people who wish to bike around Ocean Drive.  We will end up at Flo's Clam Shack across the street from the beach approximately at 7:30.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214086055000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>It's Flo's and summer.
