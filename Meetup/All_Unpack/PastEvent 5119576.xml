There have been requests from many of our new  members for this venue. We had our first Afterwork Mixer at this upscale venue and was a tremendous sucess. So please come out and have a few cocktails with the group as we gear up for the last official weekend of the summer season!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting details:  If the patio is open we will meet there, if not we will meet at the bar on the right side from the main entrance. This place is packed on Thurs nites so I highly ENCOURAGE you to attend early as possible. My picture is on the site under the Assistant Organizer section so I should not be hard to find.
