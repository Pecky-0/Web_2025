His sound is a truly organic blend of a mastery of traditional and contemporary flamenco with his love of jazz, classical, rock, and more. A graduate of New England Conservatory's Contemporary Improvisation program (formerly Third Stream), he has spent the last 20 years forging a unique path fusing an array of influences into his flamenco-based vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pascual returns to the Regattabar presenting his latest project the Juanito Pascual New Flamenco Trio featuring two highly versatile and dynamic musicians, Grammy-nominated percussionist Tupac Mantilla (Julian Lage Group, Bob Moses, Kenny Werner) and bassist Brad Barrett (Jason Moran, Ran Blake). Fusing their distinct musical backgrounds with a palpable personal chemistry, the Trio has created a distinctive and exhilarating sound. Currently, they are producing their first CD, scheduled for release in fall of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2003 release of his debut solo recording "Cosas en Comun", Pascual's international touring schedule has brought him to venues including the Tanglewood Jazz Festival, New York's 92nd ST. Y and Blue Note Jazz Club, The Panama Jazz Festival and Madrid's renowned Casa Patas. He has performed with a lengthy 'who's who' of top flamenco artists from Spain and the U.S. in addition to collaborations with a diverse range of artists including Grammy-winning soprano Dawn Upshaw, bassist John Patitucci (of Chick Corea's Band), pianist Danilo Perez (of the Wayne Shorter Qt), percussionist Jamey Haddad (of Paul Simon's group), virtuoso guitarist Grisha Goryachev, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few times I caught this trio, it's been a great show. Come join us at Regattabar for this show, if there is enough interest, we may have a post-meetup nearby (John Harvard's has proven to be a great spot for previous Harvard Square meetups, so we may do that)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are $25 and can be bought here (and catch a video clip here also):&lt;/p&gt;
