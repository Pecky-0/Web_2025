First annual picnic will be at Robinson State Park. The park has over 800 acres with five miles of frontage on the Westfield River.  The 17 acre island west of the falls at Mittineague is one of the park's most picturesque spots.  Recreational opportunities are hiking trails, bike paths, canoeing, fishing, swimming, scenic viewing areas, and of course picnicking.  We will picnic near Robinson Pond for swimming and access to the water.  The picnic will be fashioned in a pot luck style.  This is an adult only event...family and friends are more than welcome!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220976772000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218161241000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Single Mingle Picnic</name><id>8501287</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220803200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/8501287/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
