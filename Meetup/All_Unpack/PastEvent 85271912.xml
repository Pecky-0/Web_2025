We now meet Wednesdays at International Place, but because many people have conflicts with the day, I am experimenting with rotating days Monday, Tuesday or Thursday on alternate weeks (keeping the Wednesday date every other week). Â But if no one else RSVPs by the day before, I will cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware - GPS may send you to the wrong place! The building is right across from the Boston Harbor Hotel, and across from Panera. From South Station or Aquarium subway, it is a short walk down the Greenway. My cell phone number is 617-818-2923. Feel free to call if you're having trouble finding the group. We usually go out to dinner afterwards between 630-7, generally to the Quincy market food court (so you can choose to eat or not) or to Chinatown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure you can make it, please consider RSVP'ing Yes and posting a note or emailing me to say you are not sure, rather than not RSVP'ing at all. But there is no need to RSVP No if you have never been to our group before.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Usually close to au bon pain.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suzanne</member_name><member_id>1732576</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349831877000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349261558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Downtown after-work conversation group - rotating days - Tuesday this time</name><id>85271912</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349816400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/85271912/</event_url></item>
