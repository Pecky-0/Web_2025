We will be dancing and socializing, so come out and have some fun! Please bring a potluck dinner from that time era. If you know of any good music let me know or bring some music that you would like to play. We will plays some hippie games so bring one if you like.  If you have any questions my number is 603-312-6735. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have to be a former Hippie to attend but it would be more fun if you could dress in that time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this is a weather permiting event, so if there is a major snowstorm I will reschedule this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a table or chair if you have one. Thanks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hippie Philosophy: &lt;br /&gt;To be a hippie you must believe in peace as the way to resolve differences among peoples, ideologies and religions. The way to peace is through love and tolerance. Loving means accepting others as they are, giving them freedom to express themselves and not judging them based on appearances. This is the core of the hippie philosophy, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the party! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the tallest hippie there</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296657690000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295619095000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hippie Party</name><id>16131039</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296342000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/16131039/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/0/global_7821040.jpeg</photo_url></item>
