&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff00ff"&gt;Baba's Village Photo Exhibit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibit of exotic color images and multi-media presentations of a rural Indian village and its inhabitants showcase the deep connection to a man who hasn't lived there in 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Bernardin and her son Jesse traveled with her father-in-law Vinod Tripathi to his native village, Jangoan, in India, in order to document the changes in that corner of the world since their visit 10 year earlier, and to see the girls’ school built by Baba, Vinod Tripathi’s name of endearment in the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a place so remote that “limitation rather than opportunity defines everyday life,” Bernardin said. “Traveling there” – to a village without electricity or running water – “felt like stepping back in time to an India before outsourcing and call centers and middle-class growth [occurred].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her photos capture the luminous landscape, the daily routines, life lived mostly outdoors. Multimedia (video/slide) pieces show the school, interviews with the villagers and Vinod Tripathi, and interactions between the photographer and villagers on the street outside the family home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibit was made possible with support from the NLT Foundation and the Massachusetts Cultural Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernardin’s longstanding interest and experience in photography stems from her firm belief in the adage: “every picture tells a story.” Her strength is in capturing the spirit, if not the essence, of people and places – telling stories photographically. Among her previous shows are exhibits at the New Art Center in Newton and the Center for Digital Imaging Arts in Waltham. Bernardin holds a certificate in professional photography from Boston University’s Center for Digital Imaging Arts, where she transitioned from film to digital shooting and printmaking, and honed her lighting and technical skills for commercial work. She also has a Masters Degree in Public Health from the University of North Carolina. She lives in Newton.
