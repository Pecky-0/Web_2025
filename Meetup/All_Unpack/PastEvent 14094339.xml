Earlier this year I organized a successful pub crawl with my connections on Facebook that went down Boylston Street in Boston.  This time, let's switch it up - we'll move to Landsdowne Street during Red Sox season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2pm - Boston Beer Works&lt;br /&gt;3pm - Game On&lt;br /&gt;4pm - Cask'n Flagon&lt;br /&gt;5pm - Bleacher Bar&lt;br /&gt;6pm - House of Blues&lt;br /&gt;7pm - Landsdowne Pub&lt;br /&gt;8pm - Jillian's&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already checked - the Sox are not playing until 10:10 pm as they are out to Seattle and so far there are no shows scheduled for the House of Blues that Saturday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the crawl we could play some BIG BALL BOWLING at Jillian's... this should make for some interesting bowling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and invite EVERY ONE of your friends! The more, the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that there was just a pub crawl on July 10 - I had already sent out invites through Facebook to my connections and Jon was gracious enough to let me organize this one for the meetup group.  I hope you can make it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give out my cell phone to those who RSVP Yes prior to July 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Patrick Foley</member_name><member_id>7811990</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280167235000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279063782000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Landsdowne Street Pub Crawl</name><id>14094339</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279994400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/14094339/</event_url></item>
