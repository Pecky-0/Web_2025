<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We are always well received at Harold Parker. There is plenty of free parking, and bathroom facilities. It is easy to find as well. Just follow route 114 west until you see the sign for Harold Parker on the right side of the road. The entrance road is to the left. Follow  to the end and go left until you get to the ranger station. Look for MLUSA signs. Check the discussion forum for "Mushroom hunter's survival kit" on what to bring. I still have a few mushroom baskets on sale for 50 cents each ( that's what I paid for them) if you don't have your own. Contact me to reserve one, or let me know at the meetup if you need one. See you there!     Jean &lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Harold Parker State Forest 305 Middleton Rd, North Andover Ma.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jean Saunders</member_name><member_id>13202391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340029421000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fungi's &amp; gils</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mushroom-Lovers-USA</urlname><id>1497456</id><group_lat>42.4700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Mushroom Lovers USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339332009000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June 17th mushroom hunt at Harold Parker State Forest</name><id>68529042</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339943400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mushroom-Lovers-USA/events/68529042/</event_url></item>
