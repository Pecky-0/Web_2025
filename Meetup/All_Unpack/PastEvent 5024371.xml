Please come, bring friends, and bring a design piece by you or another that you like or find interesting for some reason - could be a logo, card, printout of a website, direct mail piece, anything.  We'll pass them around and share and eat delicious little satays and so forth.  And perhaps a drink special too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Fischer</member_name><member_id>3013881</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1154962341000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>New Haven Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NHDesignTech</urlname><id>283863</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Design &amp; Technology Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152906752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven/Southern CT Graphic Design August Meetup</name><id>5024371</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1154554200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NHDesignTech/events/5024371/</event_url></item>
