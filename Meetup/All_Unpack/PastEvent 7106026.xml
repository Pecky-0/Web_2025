They have plently of mild dishes if you don't like spicy and their lunch specials are very reasonable.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punjab&lt;br /&gt;473 Massachusetts Ave&lt;br /&gt;Arlington, MA 02474&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (781) 643-0943 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/34208284/arlington_ma/punjab_indian_restaurant.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston.citysea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201536430000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200256295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>minuteman bike trail walk</name><id>7106026</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201363200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7106026/</event_url></item>
