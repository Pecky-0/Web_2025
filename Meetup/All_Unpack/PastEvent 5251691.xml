<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello Boston Townhall Members,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, December 5th, will be the last Townhall meetup at my apartment. I got a great job in New Jersey, so I'll be moving in mid-December and stepping down as the Boston Townhall Organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to keep our great group alive, a member can volunteer to do one of two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Become the organizer. Let me know. You'll have to pay Meetup.com around $10.00/month, and you'll be able to organize any other kind of group you want as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Organize yourselves through Townhall.com (or Townsquare). I'm trying to figure out how to do this, and I think it's probably the best way to go. I might be able to set it up for you. I'll let you know as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you in December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorene Leiter, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Boston Townhall Meetup&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy Bock</member_name><member_id>1795100</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540705000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Conservatives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>townhall-61</urlname><id>155655</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Conservatives' Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162947832000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Townhall December Meetup</name><id>5251691</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165363200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/townhall-61/events/5251691/</event_url></item>
