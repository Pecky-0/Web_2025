Admission is $7.00 which includes a roller skate rental. If you want to rent inline skates it's $3.00 extra. You can also bring your own roller or inline skates.&amp;nbsp; We'll skate for about 2 hours and if people are interested, we can get something to eat afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always try to organized T-accessible events and even though this is in Saugus there is a bus route that travels nearby. You can log onto www.mbta.com and use the address above for details. It's Sunday so the bus may not run often so if people want to try to carpool&amp;nbsp;put it in your comment when you RSVP. For those of you driving, it's on the south bound side of Route 1 behind Honey Baked Hams. If you miss that entrance from Route 1 you can also reach the parking lot from the KFC or Taco Bell parking lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm only allowing one guest.&amp;nbsp; If you need to bring more, have them sign up for the group.&amp;nbsp; This is also a joint event with Social Fun.&amp;nbsp; If your plans change, please update your RSVP.&amp;nbsp; Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
