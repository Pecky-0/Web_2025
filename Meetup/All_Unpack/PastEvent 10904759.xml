However, the top-choice restaurant wasn't available so I went exploring on line to see if another interesting option might be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scutra, a small family-owned and run restaurant near Arlington Center, has been on my radar screen for some time. However, it wasn't until it turned up in my search that I actually checked out the menu. . . and I had to restrain myself from heading over there for dinner immediately!! Please check it out. . . I'm pretty sure at least some of you will have the same reaction! Several reviewers describe the place as a neighborhood gem, so let's go see if it lives up to its press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've made an early reservation so we will hopefully be able to chat and get to know each other a bit before the noise level gets too high! And there appear to be a number of wines available by the glass so we can play the &amp;quot;taste-and-guess&amp;quot; game that was so much fun at our recent Sabur meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your reservation fee of $2 is intended to show us that you are committed to coming. If the meetup fills, unpaid RSVPs will lose their place in line. This money is not going into my pocket -- it will be added to the tip for our table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming by public transportation and need help getting there, email me and I'll see if I can give you a ride from Alewife station. (Limit 3 people!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be in my name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250203653000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247942446000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Creative European cuisine with a Belgian influence</name><id>10904759</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248559200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/10904759/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/c/global_9722140.jpeg</photo_url></item>
