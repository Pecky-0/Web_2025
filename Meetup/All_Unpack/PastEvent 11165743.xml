We can have dinner at 7 pm and listen to music by Wandering Roots with Shawn Taylor.His music is an eclectic collection of original and traditional songs. It has been said that his lyrics dabble in a wonderful gritty naturalism that's uncommon around here. I know this is last minute, but because of an event cancellation, we are substituting this event for those of you who may be interested. The venue is very casual and always draws a good crowd. Please RSVP ASAP so that I can reserve the appropriate number of seats. If you prefer to come for drinks and music only ...that will be fine. Let's have some fun!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup Sign at the table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253537315000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250870126000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and music at Smokin With Chris</name><id>11165743</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250982000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/11165743/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/global_9920185.jpeg</photo_url></item>
