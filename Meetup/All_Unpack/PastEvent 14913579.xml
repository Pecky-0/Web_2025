Sponsors are constantly inundated with solutions promising “faster, better, and cheaper” results—but can these claims be trusted? Join FierceBiotech for an exclusive executive breakfast where we’ll discuss these and other issues facing today’s drug developers. Our expert panel will be moderated by John Carroll, Editor-in-Chief of FierceBiotech.  Carroll will be joined by top executives from AstraZeneca, Aveo, Cubist, and other leading pharmas to discuss key issues including traditional trial design optimization, adaptive clinical trials, outsourcing of trials overseas, CRO consolidation, and more! This intimate breakfast event allows attendees to hear what executives really have to say in an uncensored environment. Act now, the early bird rate ends on October 8! Sponsored by INC Research &amp;amp; Parexel. The Massachusetts Life Sciences Center is an organizational sponsor of this event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288185294000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285613781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FierceBiotech Presents: Fierce Clinical Trials Insights—An Executive Breakfast</name><id>14913579</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288180800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/14913579/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/c/global_12600668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
