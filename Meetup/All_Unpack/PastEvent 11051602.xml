It will be a relatively informal affair with no scheduled speaker to provide an opportunity for existing group members along with everyone who as joined since the last meetup several months ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location is at Vlora on Boylston. This is not a noisy bar... We'll have a relatively quiet and private area for chatting. If I can gather up some moola we may get some free eats out of it. If your company might be willing to pitch in, respond to matt@editme.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to see this group grow and flourish, please try to make this meetup. We'll be discussing ideas and plans for the group's future meetups. Also, it's important to the venue for me to given them a relatively accurate headcount, so please take a moment to RSVP yes or no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tell the staff you're with the Boston Webmasters group.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256250187000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Web Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonWebmasters</urlname><id>391084</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Webmasters Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249582338000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Webmasters August Meetup</name><id>11051602</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251153000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWebmasters/events/11051602/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/8/3/global_9647763.jpeg</photo_url></item>
