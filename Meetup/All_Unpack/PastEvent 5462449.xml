It is our monthly opportunity to practice speaking French, something that we otherwise don't have the occasion to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider whether you are willing, to the best of your ability, to actively participate in the conversation in French.  If you are willing to speak French at this meeting, then of course come.  You may feel you need more preparation, classwork, in order to begin speaking.  Only you can make this assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is part of our human nature to want to include all comers in the conversation.  If you find you can contribute only in English, then maybe you should think of a group like this as being in your future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bon courage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On se reunit au Starbucks au Nashua Mall (sortie 6 de la route 3, centre de commerce Burlington Coat Factory) le mercredi 7 mars 2007 a 19h30.  Ce sera une occasion de raconter n'importe quoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are gathering at the Starbucks at the Nashua Mall (exit 6 off of Route 3, Burlington Coat Factory shopping center) Wednesday, Mar 7, 2007, at 7:30 pm to talk and tell a bit of what's been going on since our last meet-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann</member_name><member_id>1968241</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173486847000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>french-584</urlname><id>376538</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Dis-moi French Conversation Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170898673000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dis-moi French Conversation March Meetup</name><id>5462449</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1173313800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/french-584/events/5462449/</event_url></item>
