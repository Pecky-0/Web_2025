The walk begins at 11am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fee is $10 per person (not dog) to enter the festivities, or you can make pledges to raise more money with our team on the walk.

Let's try to get a BIG group to come together and help these animals receive the care they need while waiting for their forever homes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, below you will find the basic Event Schedule for this day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk registration   9:30-11am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canine Good Citizen Testing   10-11am &amp;amp; 1-2pm (for further information email Wendy at wendytrox@yahoo.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids Corner Games &amp;amp; Activities   ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun for Dogs   ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microchipping  ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pet Psychics  ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk Begins  11am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silent Auction closes  1pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event end time  2:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be numerous pet related vendors at this event, so make sure to bring your wallets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me, Kerri Morrison, through meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.S. I will likely try to print name tags with our team name on it for the team members to stick together during the event. Look for these name tags at the registration table. However, I believe the league will be printing buttons for our team.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for our group's name on name tags.
