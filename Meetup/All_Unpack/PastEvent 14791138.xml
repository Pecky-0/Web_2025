We'll compare, anonymously, your best estimates for work in a variety of areas, then discuss how our pricing fits in with others in our area, what client expectations are for pricing, and strategies for keeping pricing at competitive rates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reserve your place&lt;/b&gt; and pay using the Paypal link, payments to Kolkdesign@usa.net at $24 per person. Please be sure to add your meal choice in the &amp;quot;Instructions to Merchant&amp;quot; section of the Paypal transaction: Chicken Confetti with Spinach, Basa Sole Picatta, or Vegetarian Pasta with Mushrooms, Artichokes &amp;amp; Sundried Tomatoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reservation Deadline&lt;/b&gt; is Thursday, September 30,  by end of day. To cancel, you must do so by this time or your payment will be forfeited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our mission is to share ideas in a relaxed casual forum. Network and make new friends, treat yourself to a nice meal and enjoy the presentation. We hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the ICC Meeting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Kolk</member_name><member_id>6023842</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286572923000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Network Marketers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>networkmarket-792</urlname><id>818489</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4400024414</group_lon><name>Independent Creative Club of Greater Hartford</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284647403000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ICC: Pricing Your Work Competitively in a Tough Economy</name><id>14791138</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286488800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/networkmarket-792/events/14791138/</event_url></item>
