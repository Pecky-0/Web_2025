Forest Medicinal Plant Walk 11-1pm  Learn to identify medicinal plants provided to us by the northern forest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 30: Chipper Vegetable Oil Conversion 12-2pm $24  Learn how our diesel wood chipper was converted to run on waste vegetable oil instead of burning fossil fuels!  View examples and learn the basics of alternative fuel systems in farm and road vehicles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you are interested in attending.  Depending on where you are coming from, maybe we can share a ride or at least look for each other at the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy, who is thrilled most of her seeds have sprouted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dacres.org/Visit%20Us.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy Esmonde</member_name><member_id>3657409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184032807000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Green Earthlings</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-286</urlname><id>459660</id><group_lat>43.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast  Energy and Permaculture Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178150928000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup at D Acres Open House Sunday 7/1</name><id>5735374</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183298400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-286/events/5735374/</event_url></item>
