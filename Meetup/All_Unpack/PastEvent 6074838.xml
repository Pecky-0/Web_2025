Some members have stated that they cannot make the weekend day, so we are going to attempt a weeknight meetup in addition to Saturday's meetings. Everyone is invited to attend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that can attend, it would be greatly appreciated, especially those that have stated a weeknight meeting would be preferential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nos Vemos,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter Melencio</member_name><member_id>2726681</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186095949000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Castellano Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-581</urlname><id>232171</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>The MetroWest-Greater Boston Castellano Speakers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185377657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weeknight Spanish Meetup!</name><id>6074838</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185922800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-581/events/6074838/</event_url></item>
