The Harvard Museum of Natural History has an exciting series of lectures and classes that address these subjects. After all, the more we know about ourselves and our planet, the richer our lives will be.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;This week's event is free with Museum admission ($9.00).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shangri-La: At the Heart of a Biodiversity Hotspot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Slide Presentation by Susan Kelley Celebrating the Chinese New Year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Rock's National Geographic accounts of his botanical explorations in the Tibetan borderlands of China were said to have inspired James Hilton's 1933 novel, Lost Horizons. Shangri-La, the utopian land of that novel, is now the name of a vibrant county in NW Yunnan - still a mysterious land where yak herds, Buddhist monks, and fierce Khampa warriors are part of the landscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Kelley, Manager of Harvard University Herbaria's Biodiversity of the Hengduan Mountains Region Project, will detail current botanical exploration in this remote region. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free with museum admission.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Note: I won't be able to attend this event. If someone would like to step up as assistant organiser, please let me know. Otherwise everyone is on their own. Either way, enjoy the talk.
