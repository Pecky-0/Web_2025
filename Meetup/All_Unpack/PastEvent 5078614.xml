<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>What better way to spend a lazy summer Sat. than a roughly 3.5 mile hike below the ridge topography at this 800 acre State Park. The hike starts from the parking lot at the entrance to the park, going out on an easy trail to Shadow Pond, then up to Lake Louise by old road and then a short more challenging rise to a lookout with some high westerly views (red to white blazed trails, then old paved road to the lake, then blue blazed trail to the lookout). We'll head back to Lake Louise and pick up the old paved road back to the parking lot (blue blazed trail to old paved road). This is a nice park with rolling ridgeline topography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area at the entrance (entrance is NEAR Penwood Rd, further west on Rte. 185) at 9 AM. There is no fee for parking. The hike is anticipated to take about 2 hours and should be done by about 11 AM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;)  is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penwood State Park map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/maps/penwood.pdf"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETS:&lt;br /&gt;Pets on a leash are permitted in picnic areas and on hiking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/penwood.htm"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/penwood.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155653277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kevin S's Hike at Penwood SP in Bloomfield CT</name><id>5078614</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156597200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5078614/</event_url></item>
