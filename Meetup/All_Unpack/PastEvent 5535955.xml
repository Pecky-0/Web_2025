Here you can mingle in the crowd, but yet feel safe with familiar faces (we'll have a reserved table to hang out at).  Going to a singles dance with your friends is a bonus and much appreciated by our last group in February.  Not so threatening for those of you who are on the shy side! Our group is very friendly and loves to dance! The DJ is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If it's your birthday in April, let me know! I'll bring a cake for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I'll have door prizes and party favors for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This place is MUCH BETTER than the Gallery!  Music is better and it's a bigger place with more people.  Real silverware and dishes!  Drinks are full size in glass not plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S.S.
