Just wanna hang out ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to walk around Fresh Pond in Cambridge and then going to Summer Shack for a bite to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear comfortable shoes because we may walk for a few miles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who's in?  It would be great to get a fairly large group of men and women for this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet me in the parking lot at Summer Shack.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer Shack's website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.summershackrestaurant.com/Locations_Cambridge.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.summershac...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer Shack is located next to Alewife in Cambridge.  The address got funky when I submitted it.  Check out Summer Shack's website for more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;617-999-9094&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190153477000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188936043000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk Around Fresh Pond - Bite to Eat at Summer Shack - Have a Drink in Cambridge</name><id>6297017</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189980000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6297017/</event_url></item>
