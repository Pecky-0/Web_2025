It is an Italian restaurant with a very eclectic menu. There will be jazz for listening only starting at 8 pm. They have great specials for $32.00 for two, which includes a bottle of wine. The location is right in the center of Southington at the Green with plenty of free parking in the rear of the building. The restaurant is owned by the same family who own Anthony Jacks, also in Southington on Center Street. It has received rave reviews since opening a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>there will be a Meetup sign on the table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253537281000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250015246000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bonterra's Dine with Jazz</name><id>11087501</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251412200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/11087501/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/global_9920185.jpeg</photo_url></item>
