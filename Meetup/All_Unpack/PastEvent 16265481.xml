We're very excited about revitalizing the group and attracting like-minded people who want to learn more about how to use the law of attraction in their everyday life. We have all levels of people... from just learning about it to others who have had great experiences with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our evening will start out with a quick introduction and then look at about a 30-45 min. segment of a movie (the first one is Deepak Chopra.)  Then have a discussion about what we learned and what we need to work on.  So bring your positive, uplifting energy and we look forward to seeing familiar faces and brand new ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first meeting will be Nov. 10th from 7:00-8:30 at a location in Scarborough (very easy to get to) and we'll send the info. to those who sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to a fun, eventful evening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caryn and Lisa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caryn and Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299194929000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>MegaMagnets</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PLOAConnection</urlname><id>1426391</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Laws of Attraction Connection</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288111036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Upcoming Law of Attraction Meeting</name><id>16265481</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299108600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PLOAConnection/events/16265481/</event_url></item>
