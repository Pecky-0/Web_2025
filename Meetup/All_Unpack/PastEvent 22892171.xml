&lt;p&gt;I anticipate this being a fairly fast paced walk- my fruitless attempt at tiring out my dog before I head off to work at 7:30 AM.&amp;nbsp; So let's try to get 2.5-3 miles in during our one hour walk, leaving RIGHT AT 5:30 AM- and we'll&amp;nbsp;be back at the cars at 6:30.&amp;nbsp; Primarily packed sand/dirt, with some crushed gravel trails, and a few very short but steep inclines- otherwise very much a&amp;nbsp; level,&amp;nbsp;very easy&amp;nbsp;trail.&amp;nbsp; For safety purposes, this walk will only be held if there is enough firm, committed interest...if not, I'll cancel the night before.&amp;nbsp; Please only RSVP yes if you are truly committed to coming.&amp;nbsp; I realize not everyone's an early bird- so if you don't typically walk at this hour and are likely to hit snooze or ignore the alarm clock, skip RSVPing for this event and catch us at another one:) But if like me you're an early bird who gets out to walk before work- let's meet up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing everyone...and friendly, leashed pooches (that you clean up after) are also welcomed!&amp;nbsp; Please note there will be a $1 fee collected from everyone to help Angela defray the cost of the meetup dues.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the main lot across from the Visitors Center (a white house)...I drive a blue Pacifica with NY plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308791301000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308607933000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunrise Maudslay Walk before we head off to work!</name><id>22892171</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308735000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/22892171/</event_url></item>
