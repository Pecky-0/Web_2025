A whip-smart screenplay, super sharp direction and a peak-performance cast.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;    -Stephen Rebello, Playboy Magazine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Screenwriter Diablo Cody defies expectations, writing dialogue with a hip eloquence that startles the ear.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;    -Kirk Honeycutt, The Hollywood Reporter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a confidently frank teenage girl who calls the shots with a nonchalant cool and an effortless attitude as she journeys through an emotional nine-month adventure into adulthood. Quick-witted and distinctively unique, Juno walks Dancing Elk High's halls to her own tune?preferably anything by The Stooges?but underneath her tough, no-nonsense exterior is just a teenage girl trying to figure it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While most girls at Dancing Elk are updating their MySpace page or shopping at the mall, Juno is a whip-smart Minnesota teen living by her own rules. A typically boring afternoon becomes anything but when Juno decides to have sex with the charmingly unassuming Bleeker (Michael Cera). Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, she and best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) hatch a plan to find Juno's unborn baby the perfect set of parents courtesy of the local Penny Saver. They set their sights on Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), an affluent suburban couple who are longing to adopt their first child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Juno has the support of her dad and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney). After the initial shock that their daughter has been sexually active with the unlikely &amp;quot;virile&amp;quot; Bleeker, the family bands together to help Juno. Dad Mac accompanies Juno to size up the prospective adoptive parents to make sure they are not a couple of &amp;quot;wing nuts&amp;quot; while stepmother Bren provides emotional support as Juno fights the prejudices of underage pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Juno moves closer and closer to her due date, the veneer of Mark and Vanessa's idyllic life starts to show signs of cracking. With a fearless intellect far removed from the usual teen angst, Juno conquers her problems head-on, displaying a youthful exuberance both smart and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juno is a whip-smart teen confronting an unplanned pregnancy by her classmate Bleeker. With the help of her hot best friend Leah, Juno finds her unborn child a &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; set of parents: an affluent suburban couple, Mark and Vanessa, longing to adopt. Luckily, Juno has the total support of her parents as she faces some tough decisions, flirts with adulthood and ultimately figures out where she belongs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.foxsearchlight.com/videos/node/2210" target="_blank"&gt;Click Here To Watch Movie Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are only $5 and will sell out fast, so get your tickets online today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet the &lt;a href="http://www.CTNites.com" target="_blank"&gt;CTNites.com&lt;/a&gt; VIP Entertainment Club in the lobby at 6:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the movies!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208087909000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Classy CT Match Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Match-Singles-Events</urlname><id>357950</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>CTMatch Singles Events Music Dance Speed Dating Golf Comedy</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206827960000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>VIP Movie Nite- See Academy Award Winner Juno for only $5!</name><id>7629355</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207866600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CT-Match-Singles-Events/events/7629355/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/8/c/global_3634236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
