This class will cover everything from sits, downs and stays to competition heelwork and advanced tricks - depending on the flavor of the week and the skills of the dogs/handlers attending - and will be completely free! There is a four dog maximum, and to reserve your spot, you must call (508) 541-PETS. TK Pet Supply is located on 158 Main Street in Norfolk, MA and will take place on Wednesdays at 12:00p. Call ahead to reserve your place; there will also be a Wait List. This class will last about 45 minutes +/-. Hope to see you there taking advantage of a great opportunity. TK Pet Supply specializes in premium pet nutrition, and supplies AMAZING dog treats. Feel free to come in early to pick some up before class!
