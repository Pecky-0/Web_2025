Mount Auburn, designated a National Historic Landmark, is one of the country's most significant designed landscapes.  Here the arts of horticulture, architecture and sculpture combine with the beauty of art and nature to create a place of comfort and inspiration.  This 1.5-mile walking tour will focus on the stories of history, monuments, and the lives of those buried here.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour is supposed to last about 1.5 hours.  I have gotten the Nerd Fun group the discounted memebership price for all those who want to go.  So it is only $5 instead of $10.  I went there a couple weeks ago for a separate event and it really is gorgeous.  With the nice weather we are supposed to have and all the rain we got, I am sure it will be great.  And getting the history of the area is just an added bonus.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please sign up for this event so that you will be on the list.
