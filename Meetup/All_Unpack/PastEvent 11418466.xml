<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Located on the Ludlow/Belchertown line, this small Boy Scout Camp owned by Ludlow's Troop 180 has acres and acres of woods and streams, and fields. The hike is a mixed challenge of mostly flat terrain and an occasional hill, but should be acceptable for all ranges of hikers. Dogs should be on leash until we get into the woods or we see how the dogs behave with one another. Deer can often be seen, along with other small wildlife. Dogs can swim in the stream. Please bring bags to clean up after your dog especially in the field area, as well as insect repellent to ward off any lingering mosquitos or ticks. This is a private property and Meetup attendees are guests of Assistant Meetup Organizer and Assistant Scoutmaster Paul (Zielinski).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Use the parking lot along the front of or to the far, far left of the small brick Troop camp building.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>7131280</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255281314000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253453150000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scouting the woods hike-Ludlow</name><id>11418466</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254070800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/11418466/</event_url></item>
