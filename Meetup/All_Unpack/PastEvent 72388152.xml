&lt;p&gt;The water dogs will have plenty of time to play in the water. The distance from the parking lot to the start of the pond is only 0.5 miles and one lap around the pond is 1 mile long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time Dave will be starting a longer 6 mile hike that goes past the pond and up to the top of the Northern peak of Saddleback Mtn.   The two groups will split up shortly after the hike starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are signed up for the longer hike and would rather do the shorter one please change your RSVP on the 6 mile hike to a no so other people on the waiting list can go.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robin Homsey-Blaine</member_name><member_id>2500267</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342748280000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341705804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Northwood Meadows State Park  3 mile shorter hike</name><id>72388152</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341756000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/72388152/</event_url></item>
