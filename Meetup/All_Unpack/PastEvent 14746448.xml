It’s led by the much-anticipated “Conviction,’’ which is already generating strong Oscar buzz for one of its stars, &lt;b&gt;Sam Rockwell, who is scheduled to attend the film’s screening on Saturday at 9:15 p.m.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Directed by Tony Goldwyn, “Conviction’’ is the true story of Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) of Ayer, a working mother who waged an 18-year fight to overturn the 1983 wrongful murder conviction of her brother, Kenneth (Rockwell). Waters earned first her GED, then college and law school degrees, all in a desperate effort to represent her brother after he’d run out of appeals through public defenders. Working with the Innocence Project, a nonprofit “court of last resort,’’ Waters was able to obtain DNA testing on crime-scene evidence in the case, leading to Kenneth’s exoneration in 2001. &lt;b&gt;The impressive cast also features Minnie Driver, Juliette Lewis, and Melissa Leo&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always good to get your tickets ahead of time, just in case:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the late screening time, John will seek to make reservations at the Rock Bottom Brewery for 7:30 pm for those of us who want to meetup, share a microbrew, maybe some DNA testing, and head to the Stuart Theater as it makes its official debut as a real venue in the Boston Cinema Market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the movies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284335258000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conviction</name><id>14746448</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284858900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/14746448/</event_url></item>
