Often naturalists describe themselves as &amp;quot;skeptical&amp;quot; -- for example, about the existence of God, miracles, etc.  Let's devote this meeting to an exploration of what exactly, if anything, naturalists are skeptical about -- are they skeptical only about supernatural beings, or also about things other than supernatural beings?  And what exactly does it mean to say that they are &amp;quot;skeptical&amp;quot;?  Are there different types of skepticism, and if so, which are most appropriate, which least appropriate, for naturalism?  As usual, no particular background is needed, so please come and help us explore this dimension of naturalist thinking!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look in alcove on second floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>4941234</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250029119000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246251955000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Are Naturalists Skeptics?
