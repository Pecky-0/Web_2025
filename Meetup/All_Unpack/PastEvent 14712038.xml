I will be at the theater at 6:15. We'll head into the theater to get seats at 6:40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, since we see movies opening weekend, it is a very good idea to buy tickets ahead of time on fandango.com...especially if it is a big name movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing my red hat with the meetup logo. Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: October 15, 2010&lt;br /&gt;Studio: Summit Entertainment&lt;br /&gt;Director: Robert Schwentke&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Erich Hoeber, Jon Hoeber&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Mary-Louise Parker, Brian Cox, Julian McMahon, Richard Dreyfuss&lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Comedy&lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for intense sequences of action violence and brief strong language)&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.red-themovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.red-themov...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Based on the cult D.C.
