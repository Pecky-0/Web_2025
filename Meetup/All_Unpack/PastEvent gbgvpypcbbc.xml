If you're a beginner or just interested in culture, you'll fit in fine! Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn and practice over a few drinks. Can't make it on time? Need to leave early? Not a problem. Just stop by if you can!&lt;br /&gt;Don't see a lot of people on the RSVP list? That because most people just show up. It will help if you RSVP, but that's not necessary. We're averaging about 25 people each night, so don't let the lack of RSVPs keep you home! ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Also, if you will be joining us, please use public transportation. Not only is driving while intoxicated dangerous, but there may not be any parking available in the area. Mass. Ave. also has street cleaning starting at midnight. Best methods for public transportation are the green line subway to the Kenmore stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Important notice ***&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your ID or Passport. No ID No Drinks. Also you must be over 21 y/o.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Trying to gather tables at the end of the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mika</member_name><member_id>6970020</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295576703000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289261530000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Japanese evening table</name><id>gbgvpypcbbc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295571600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/16068979/</event_url></item>
