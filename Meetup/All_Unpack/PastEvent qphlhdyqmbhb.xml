&lt;p&gt;A new force is rising in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. The Council of Spiders works secretly to further Lolth’s efforts to seize artifacts of magic. With members from many high-ranked houses, the council conspires to topple the mighty priestesses and secure its place at Lolth’s side. The priestesses of Lolth are cunning, though, and they won’t cede power easily to their wizardly counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which side will you choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Council of Spiders&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Roleplaying Game&lt;/em&gt; adventure designed for the summer 2012 season of the &lt;em&gt;D&amp;amp;D Encounters&lt;/em&gt; official play program. In this season, participants are encouraged to play drow characters as they vie for supremacy in the Underdark, and incorporates lore from &lt;em&gt;Menzoberranzan: City of Intrigue&lt;/em&gt;. The adventure takes characters from levels 1—3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season also features the newest set of D&amp;amp;D Fortune Cards from the "Drow Treachery" set. These treachery cards work like other fortune cards but tie into the optional "Worth" System introduced in the upcoming Menzoberranzan: City ot Intrigue" supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new 4th edition, 1st level character. It is strongly suggested that players be drow or a slave of the drow and choose from dwarf, goblin, half-orc, human, kobold, and svirfneblin. It is also suggested that no more than two players per table choose a non-drow race.  Drow and other races can be evil but they need to have a spirit of cooperation with the other participants! This season assumes a bit of backbiting among the characters, reflecting the opportunities presented in the course of adventuring to claim a small amount of personal "Worth" at the expense of one's allies. Friendly competition is encouraged but NOT an all out war!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each character will either belong to one of two drow houses (Xorlarrin or Melarn) or be a member of the Bregan D'aerthe mercenary group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drow's station determines his or her place in the society of Menzoberranzan. One way this station is reflected is through a character's "Worth" score. All characters start with a worth score of zero but that is modified by these modifiers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female +5, Male -5,  Member of one of the drow houses +1, Priestess +5, Wizard +3 and Fighter +1. Over the course of this adventure your character's worth is modified by three factors: playing treachery cards, completing house goals and miscellaneous actions. More details will be presented at the first session.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dale King</member_name><member_id>4528347</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David P.
