Ok, I need to limit, so not all all.  You know what I'm saying.&lt;br /&gt;I need more coffee now- see you in August. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YIPPEE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mindy</member_name><member_id>4498017</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282005275000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Euchre Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>euchre-262</urlname><id>1040200</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North of Boston Euchre Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279739497000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FINALLY SOME EUCHRE!!!</name><id>14171390</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281826800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euchre-262/events/14171390/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/global_3408104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
