Come on out and get some laughtercise to work off Thanksgiving dinner and sharpen your wits about you at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember there's no improv or acting experience required, so make this your first incubator for the bunch of you that have yet to play with us and for everyone else make this your 2nd or your 50th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$3 suggested donation that pays for cost of room rental and the meetup.com fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note is that I'd just like to give thanks to everyone who has supported the the incubator through the past I believe it's 4 years.  Here's to more fun, laughter, and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks, peace, prosperity, moments of breath and overall awesomeness to everyone today and everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Jedrusiak&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291912586000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291220725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Return of the Living Incubator 5: Ding from the Grave - Come laughtercise!</name><id>15608442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291336200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/15608442/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
