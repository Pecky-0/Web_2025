I am going to try and be a month ahead for all meetups, so you can plan accordingly.  I know this is around the holidays, so if you can't make it, we'll miss you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the feedback from the polls, the restaurant I chose for December is Rasoi.  See info about the restaurant and menu here &lt;a href="http://www.rasoi-restaurant.com/dinnermenu-rasoi.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rasoi restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.  I figured this would be a little lighter for around the holidays, a little less expensive and hopefully will satisfy the Indian food lovers as well as vegetarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to reserve a setup for 18 with individual bills.  If the event fills up, please respond as &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and state that you would like to be put on the wait list.  If there are any cancelations, I will contact people in order of RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the tremendous respose for this meetup, I will only be collecting the $1.00 for meetup fees every other meetup.  If you don't think this is fair, please let me know and I will see about another solution.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199063487000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-617</urlname><id>790320</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193952374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Dining December meetup- RASOI's</name><id>6658181</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198886400000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-617/events/6658181/</event_url></item>
