Think Joseph Cornell, or Michael DeMeng;  think altered shrines, museums, theatres, antique stores...or create something new...whatever you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our studio group has acquired a generous supply of old wooden boxes, formerly used to sort buttons in a retail store.  These are roughly 14&amp;quot; long, by 6&amp;quot; across, by 3&amp;quot; deep...(I haven't actually measured them, but will later today...then we'll see how accurate my estimate is!)  There are also many small cardbard boxes that fit inside as dividers.  A few of the wooden boxes are already gessoed, and ready to work on;  many are still in their original unfinished state.  We'll make one of these available to you at the meetup, along with the space, and some additional shared tools and supplies, and lots of shared inspiration, discussion and laughter! (Additional boxes may be available for a reasonable fee.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, gather up all those bits and pieces that you've saved ... bring your own supplies, ideas and creativity, and come share the fun.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>emelengy</member_name><member_id>4250560</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237744480000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Creative Types</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>assemblageart-29</urlname><id>748373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Altered Art and Assemblage Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233596588000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wooden Boxes, continued...</name><id>9654318</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235325600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/assemblageart-29/events/9654318/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/1/global_4071601.jpeg</photo_url></item>
