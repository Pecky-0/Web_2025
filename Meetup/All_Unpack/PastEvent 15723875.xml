We should tell about where our favorite city is and why.  The volcabulary should have lots of descriptive words about what you like about your favorite city. This can be a city you have visited, have lived in, or dream of visiting.  You should anticipate talking for about 5 minutes on this topic  and answers questions for about 5 minutes on this topic.  That evening, I will distribute some volcabulary words that we can share and use throughout the evening. We can vote on the next topic for the next dinner.  Our last dinner was a great success so I hope you attend this one too. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294529250000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Arabic Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonArabic</urlname><id>1143990</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Area Arabic Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292275932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arabic Language Practice and Dinner</name><id>15723875</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294444800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonArabic/events/15723875/</event_url></item>
