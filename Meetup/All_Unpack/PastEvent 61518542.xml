The gate may still be closed to the parking lot but we can do roadside just before the parking lot hopefully. Look for my old '03 maroon Chevy Monte Carlo. &lt;br /&gt;

 There's a gorgeous trail from Dennison to Otter River. Easy to moderate. Dogs welcome. Bringing my new granddog Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilder/ McKenzie Trail is approximately a 2 mile trail connecting from Lake Dennison State Park in Winchendon to Otter River State Forest in Baldwinville. The trail head begins at Otter River but until the parking lot opens, it's best to start at Dennison for more parking capacity. It's a round trip folks so that's four miles of easy trail with a few inclines here and there. &lt;br /&gt;

 I don't think the actual parking area is open yet but roadside is available off of rt 202 before the gate. Follow the directions to the beach...a little too soon for a swim though.&lt;img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif" alt="wink" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
