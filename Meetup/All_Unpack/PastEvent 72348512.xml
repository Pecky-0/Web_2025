What a steal... and yum...!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone "young at heart" can ride the merry-go-round.... or just sit in there lounge chair and be old...LOL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a beautiful time of the day to be at the beach... this happens every Tuesday at Easton's Beach - different type of music each week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event is cancelled if rain or rain is predicted - we will all keep an eye out for such...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carpooling - some may want to car pool with those who have an EZ-Pass - otherwise the bridge is $4 each way... There is a Park &amp;amp; Ride off the Narragansett Exit off Rt 138 = the last exit before the Jamestown Bridge - I'll leave that up to you to make any carpool arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>PICNIC TABLE AREA - I'LL HAVE A SIGN</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gail</member_name><member_id>4249649</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342709110000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Exciting People Having Some Fun!</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mingle-with-singles</urlname><id>1452082</id><group_lat>41.9099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Mingle with singles 45+ Socializing and dancing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341679988000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easton's Beach in Newport - outdoor music</name><id>72348512</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342560600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mingle-with-singles/events/72348512/</event_url></item>
