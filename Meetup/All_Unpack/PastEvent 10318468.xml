We will be saving the last 30 minutes, 4:30-5:00, to provide an introduction to the Course for those that are less famliar with its origins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to look at specific workbook lessons and to focus on the Course's rather non-traditional view of forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Theresa</member_name><member_id>4688183</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241982360000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Students of ACIM</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>acim-309</urlname><id>1241028</id><group_lat>41.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Connecticut A Course In Miracles Study Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241272100000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ACIM Meetup Group</name><id>10318468</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241377200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/acim-309/events/10318468/</event_url></item>
