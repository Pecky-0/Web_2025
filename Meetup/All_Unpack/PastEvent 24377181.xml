<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's have a party! Let's have some fun, hang out, schmooze, and meet the other members of Boston Dreamers Meetup group. Your non-dream group friends are invited too! We will play dream games, sing dream songs, dance to dream music, and play with oracle cards. Feel free to bring your favorite dream songs, musical instruments, dream games, and/or oracle cards to show off and play with. The theme of the party is dreams, so bring anything which reminds you of dreams and dreaming.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This is also Deerheart's birthday party and a masquerade costume party. Presents, cards, costumes, and masks are all optional. You are invited (but not required) to wear a mask or to dress as a character from a dream or a character from Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Some costumes and masks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There will be a vegetarian potluck buffet, so bring some vegetarian food to share. This is a smoke-free household. It's an indoor party with air conditioning, so even if it's a hot day, we will be comfy-cool!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;For extra credit, set an intention to have a dream about the party before the event. For extra-extra credit set an intention to come to the party house the night before in your dreams and meet with other dreamers and have a dream-dream party! We will share our results at the awake dream party, on July 23!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 6 PM - 12 Midnight. This is a party, so you can drop in whenever you feel like it. If you wish to attend you must RSVP to be sent the address of the party. Sorry, I can't put the address on the net.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deerheart</member_name><member_id>7399016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1311540983000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dreamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonDreamers</urlname><id>1339734</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Dreamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309651611000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Midsummer Night's Dream Party 2</name><id>24377181</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1311458400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonDreamers/events/24377181/</event_url></item>
