What is love?   Is love innate to us?  Is it learned?  Why do we love? Why are we lonely?  Why does it hurt? Is love blind?  Does our heart make us more foolish, make us less rational? How does our past shape us for better and worse? 
&lt;p&gt;What have you learned in your relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
 What do you feel still alludes you in relationships? Join us for a discussion the human condition commonly diagnosed as love.</description><how_to_find_us>Date subject to change.
