<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9:00 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;* North on Merit Parkway&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 59&lt;br /&gt;* Left onto Whally Ave.&lt;br /&gt;* Take 1st right onto Pond Lilly&lt;br /&gt;** Take 1st right onto Valley St.&lt;br /&gt;* Left at 1st light onto Blake St.&lt;br /&gt;* Left into Blake St. center&lt;br /&gt;* Hike in rear of parking lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* South on Merit Parkway&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 59&lt;br /&gt;* Right at end of ramp&lt;br /&gt;* Take 1st left onto Pond Lilly&lt;br /&gt;* See above directions (**)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I don't know of a map for this site***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
