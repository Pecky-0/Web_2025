This sounds like a perfect &amp;quot;salty&amp;quot; summer evening. Seafood and a walk on the Boardwalk. What more is there? Hmmm, ok there's an ice cream cone afterward. As a former landlubber (sp?), I'm really looking forward to this one. I hope you'll join me. I spoke with the restaurant and they do NOT accept reservations but said that if I give them a heads-up an hour or so before we arrive , they will try to hold one LARGE table for us that seats 15. We'll figure it out when we get there. Please RSVP soon, I'll set the limit at 15 people but if it fills up come anyway and we'll commandeer another table.
