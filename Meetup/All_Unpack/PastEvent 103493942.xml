Route is 4.6 miles up and down with 2100' of elevation gain. We will likely loop over to South Peak and Rimrock for the views and alpine zone travel, which adds an easy mile extra. BYO snowshoes, windgear, 2 qt water, and food. Ski poles recommended. &lt;br /&gt;

 Leader reserves right to refuse participation to underequipped persons, and leader's judgement is final. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please register by 8 PM Sat 2/9, when leader will reserve table for our breakfast at Mickey's. You are welcome to join us anyway, but we cannot guarantee you a place at our table. After breakfast we carpool to the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1360535003000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360250093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Snowshoe Mt.
