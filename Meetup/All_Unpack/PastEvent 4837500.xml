I have decided to organize Boston Ecademy meetings on a bi-monthly basis.  So mark you calendars for 2006.  We'll be meeting only six times this year:  January, March, May, July, September and November.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda for March 2006 Meeting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 - 6:30PM Introductions&lt;br /&gt;6:30 - 7:00PM Roundtable Discussions&lt;br /&gt;7:00 - 7:30PM Guest Speaker - Curtis Muldrew&lt;br /&gt;7:30 - 8:00PM Speed Networking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting adjourns at 8:00PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to plan a one minute introduction of who you are and what you are looking to accomplish in networking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members who RSVP by March 22nd pay $6.00 fee for the meeting. (Member Signup is Free at this site.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All others and those who register at the door pay $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT:  If you arrive after 6:00PM, the front doors will be locked.
