We will focus their efforts by providing them with a new shelter that will house them for the winter and allow us to move them through various garden beds. They will enjoy scratching the soil for crop residue and overwintering insects while leaving behind a layer of lightly tilled and fertilized topsoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will learn some basic carpentry skills, how to design a structure to accommodate hens in a small area and how to put the birds to work and play for the enrichment of the whole garden system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loose agenda:&lt;br /&gt;12:30- Meet and greet&lt;br /&gt;12:45- Assemble  materials and discuss design of the hen quarters&lt;br /&gt;1:30- Build the structure&lt;br /&gt;3:30- Catch the hens and put them in their new home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a snack to share with the group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $2 fee is to help with meetup costs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the back yard with the hens</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260120544000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256757629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chicken Tractor</name><id>11734530</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257701400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/11734530/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/7/global_7064327.jpeg</photo_url></item>
