Trivia does not start until 8pm however it is good to get there early and find a table. It is a pretty small bar so it will be easy to find the Trailblazers. If you are new the Trailblazers or you have not met me you can email me and I can let you know where we will be. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>9389653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297050964000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Join us at Kelley's Row in Dover, NH on Wednesday night for great night of trivia.
