Monday, November 22nd at 7pm&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Doug Graham will be coming to speak with at Raw Food Central in Windsor, CT. Windsor is right next to Hartford, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Doug Graham has 30+ years of experience helping others obtain true health with the ultimate raw diet and lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;His website is: www.foodnsport.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His major focus is on the 80-10-10 diet which is:&lt;br /&gt;80% carbs from fruits and veggies&lt;br /&gt;10% protein&lt;br /&gt;10% fat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is has changed my view of eating into a healthy and balanced way of eating and has me excited about being in balance and having a harmonious relationship with my foods. If anyone is interested there could be ample opportunity for carpooling. It is definitely worth seeing Dr. Doug Graham!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Martin</member_name><member_id>1315927</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290618057000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-386</urlname><id>279146</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289580889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dr. Doug Graham  at Raw Food Central </name><id>15426896</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290470400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-386/events/15426896/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/8/a/global_1616698.jpeg</photo_url></item>
