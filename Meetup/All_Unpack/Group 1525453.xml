&lt;p&gt;The WBOA produces once monthly breakfast meetings, featuring engaging speakers, presenting a range of topics relevant to the lives of business women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer seminars on various ways to build your business, our first one being scheduled for the end of September.  New members to the WBOA will also be provided a mentor, one of our senior members, to help them learn the ropes, answer any business questions based on their experience, and help them ease into the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WBOA also connects its members by organizing social events throughout the year, such as our Women's Night of Comedy, and annual Woman of the Year event.  This year we will also begin a monthly casual dinner networking event.&lt;/p&gt;
