We have some very successful folks and some that are struggling.I understand,I fall into the latter group,most of the time.I would love to have a Meetup Fair.If that is too ambitious at this time,one thought I have is that we might put together a Workshop,to help to understand and educate,and therefore encourage those of us who labor to start and keep our groups going.I am sorry to be contacting you all again so soon.If you are ticked-off(that is not how I usually put it,so forgive me if I spelled ticced wrong).If you find yourself P---ed-off at me,you can come to the next meetup and hit me.dale&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175900685000</updated><rating><average>2.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Organizers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NEOrganizers</urlname><id>321127</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>New England Meetup Organizers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173548117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>What Works for a Successful Meetup?</name><id>5555995</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175727600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NEOrganizers/events/5555995/</event_url></item>
