The years of the most visible struggle lie between the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. the Board of Education that reasoned that racial separation was inherently unequal and the 1964 Civil Rights Act which provided some means for Federal enforcement of its provisions. &lt;br /&gt;

 There were several vital campaigns which riveted and mobilized the American public; the Freedom Rides of 1961 was one. Principles of non-violence were put into play against locally organized violence and institutional collusion and indifference to a government&amp;rsquo;s obligation to protect unpopular rights. And much of it was brought before the public by national media. &lt;br /&gt;

 Conversations will watch the 2011 Program &amp;ldquo;Freedom Riders&amp;rdquo; that retells the story of the Summer of 1964 with historic film clips and contemporary interviews with participants.&lt;/p&gt;
