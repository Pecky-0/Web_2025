So I thought I would get a head start on this and post it now (1/12/09).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Star Trek starts out with Kirk as a young boy and profiles him as he gets command of the first Starship to fly out of the newly formed Star Fleet command.   Movie takes a spin like Batman did - &amp;quot;The beginning is Now&amp;quot;.  Leonard Nimoy is supposed to be in it too - that should be interesting given he is now like 80 or something.  Film comes out May 8th - so we'll pick a week later for the date: May 16th.  Get your communicators ready....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Update: Movie at 7:35 PM.  We will be going in the theatre at 7:20 PM.  After 7:20 PM you can call me or text me on my cell phone.  Cell Phone will be given to the Yes's and Maybe's on Friday.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will be standing in front of Chatters Resuraunt inside</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich</member_name><member_id>2404346</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243724963000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231775667000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Star Trek The movie</name><id>9505073</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242514800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/9505073/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_5165560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
