Join other fantastically creative Boston artists for a night of sharing digital photography, graphic design, interactive/web, video, and animation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night will be an opportunity to meet other artists working locally in creative fields, and for aspiring artists to learn and receive inspiration from others. Depending on the number of members who participate, we may break into smaller groups for several rounds of portfolio viewings. We will also discuss tips for presentation and what goes into making a great portfolio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to share your work, please note this in your RSVP comment and bring prints, or a laptop (we will have free wi-fi access).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our group has many incredibly talented artists and I look forward to seeing everyone's work!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245801023000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238384342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portfolio Night</name><id>10067185</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241047800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/10067185/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
