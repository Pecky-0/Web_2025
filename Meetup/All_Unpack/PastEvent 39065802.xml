Come join us for lots of fun. There are six players to a team. The questions are not too hard and the food and drink makes it easier. We have done pretty well in the past. We won pub crawl tickets, hats and t-shirts, a gift certificate to Margaritas and a gift certificate to Kelley's Row. It is a pretty small bar so it will be easy to find the Trailblazers. If you are new the Trailblazers or you have not met me you can email me and I can let you know where we will be. All are welcome and always love to meet new people. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>9389653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320888241000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319820753000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia Night at Kelley's Row</name><id>39065802</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320883200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/39065802/</event_url></item>
