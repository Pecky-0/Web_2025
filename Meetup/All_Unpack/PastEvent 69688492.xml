<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Our fourth meeting on C. S. Peirce will look at his writings from the period of his fourth system. In particular we will focus on two essays that best outline his mature philosophy from the Metaphysical series published in &lt;em&gt;The Monist&lt;/em&gt; from 1891-93. These articles are an attempt to expand upon some of his ideas sketched in“A Guess at the Riddle” that we looked at briefly in our readings of his third system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary readings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/necessity/necessity.htm"&gt;“The Doctrine of Necessity Examined”&lt;/a&gt; he argues his anti-deterministic position supported by his idea of tychism. The final essay from the series, &lt;a href="http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/evolove/evolove.htm"&gt;“Evolutionary Love,”&lt;/a&gt; he explains his notions of synechism and agapeism. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Supplementary readings:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/whatis/whatpragis.htm"&gt;“What is Pragmatism?”&lt;/a&gt; from his 1905 Pragmatism series of articles in &lt;em&gt;The Monist&lt;/em&gt; presents one of his best discussions of his view of Pragmatism as philosophy. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The 1894 essay &lt;a href="http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/ep2book/ch02/ep2ch2.htm"&gt;“What is a Sign?”&lt;/a&gt; is a good overview of Peirce’s semiotics. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm"&gt;“F. R. L.”&lt;/a&gt; from 1899 is a good conclusion to our reading showing just how far Peirce has traveled from his early writings on logic and his early “On a New List of Categories.”&lt;/p&gt;
