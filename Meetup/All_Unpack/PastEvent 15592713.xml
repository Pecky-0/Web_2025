<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are going to standout for Christmas at the entrance to the Hampshire Mall in Hadley. It is a prime location for this event. There are two entrances to the Mall, The first is closest to the set of lights on Route 9, and the second is located a little further down across from the shopping plaza. It has a Walmart, Barnes and Noble, Whole Foods, and other large retail stores. There are large grassy areas close to the street that will give us a safe place to stand out as well as high visibility. Plenty of parking as well.  Let's get together and bring our &amp;quot;WE SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS MESSAGE&amp;quot; to Hadley.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna R.</member_name><member_id>8973743</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise Baran</member_name><member_id>9211691</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292695967000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>We Surround Them</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Western-Mass-912-Project</urlname><id>1394602</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6299972534</group_lon><name>The Original WMass 912 Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291096711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Merry Christmas Super Rally</name><id>15592713</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292691600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Western-Mass-912-Project/events/15592713/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/9/global_7591481.jpeg</photo_url></item>
