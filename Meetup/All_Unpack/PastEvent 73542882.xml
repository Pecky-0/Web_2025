Expect to be in your kayak for at least 2 hours, possibly more.  We'll return to the launch site and those who want to stay to paddle into the main lake to explore coves and islands, can continue on.  I am unsure at this time if I will paddle with you in the main lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to make a day of it, there is plenty more paddling to be had in the main lake, along with stopping on islands with sandy spots, to take a swim.  There is also excellent hiking in the area and some spots are accessible from the canoe launch (Jacobs Hill, The Ledges, Doane's Falls).  Royalston Falls is accessible via a short drive up Route 32 North.  All hikes mentioned are on property managed by The Trustees of Reservations and more info can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you RSVP, mention if you will be staying to paddle into the main lake after our trip up to Long Pond.  That way, others will know if they will have paddling companions and can plan accordingly. By the same token, you can mention "hiking" if you are looking for others to do that with you after paddling.  If you see that others have mentioned "staying to paddle in main lake" or "hiking" you can get in touch with them through this site to discuss details, or correspond in the "comments" section of the meetup page. Make sure to be clear if you are paddling up to long pond only, then hiking, or paddling the pond &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; main lake and then hiking.  If you have enough energy to do all that, good for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;More about directions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do not look for us at the dam!  Yes, there is a boat launch there, but you will not find us if you go there by mistake.  If you are driving north on Route 32 out of Athol, go past the dam (or stop at the top for a moment to admire the view), drive a bit further and turn onto Doane Hill Road on your right.  Once you pass the entrance to the Tully Lake Campground on your right, the dirt road down to the canoe launch is just over the bridge and on your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: There are showers and flush toilets at Tully Lake Campground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long range forecast looks good.  If you do not plan to join us, do not RSVP "NO".  I only need to know about people who are coming.  For this and all meetups, if you need to change your RSVP from Yes to NO, please &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; not to do it at the last minute (I realize things &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; come up at the last minute), so those on a waiting list can have some advanced notice. Thanks for your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLEASE NOTE - The organizers in this group are NOT trained leaders or instructors.  The organizers only set the time and place, each person participating in any group trip is responsible for their own safety.  Each participant is responsible for evaluating all relevant conditions for the trip and determining if their skills and equipment are appropriate for those conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
