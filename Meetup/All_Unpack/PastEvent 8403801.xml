We'll walk if it isn't raining.  Check back around 1 PM on Sat for the final weather decision.  This is a beautiful piece of property with varied topography and vegetation.  A river runs through part of it so both us and our dogs will be able to swim if it's muggy.  I'll be wearing river sandals and swim shorts.  It's a very dog friendly place used by many in the community.  Joggers use the area as well.  Dog droppings must be picked up.  PLEASE have your dog leashed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there take Rt. 66 West out of Northampton past Smith College.  Go over the river and as you crest a hill the road divides.  Take the right onto Prince St. and pass the community gardens on the right.  The parking is the next dirt lot on the right.  You'll probably see cars there - be careful it is very potholed.  See ya there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather update:  We're fine and walking.  See you at 3 today.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll be able to recognize me &amp; my pooch from our profile photos.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217271970000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216915441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Former Northampton State Hospital Dog Walk</name><id>8403801</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217098800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/8403801/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/c/1/global_4906289.jpeg</photo_url></item>
