Plenty of routes and a 90 foot tall wall in spots.  You can lead here too (at your own risk.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will set up our ropes and climb about 3 hours.  Please bring water, sunscreen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet for car pooling at 9 AM. &lt;br /&gt;Meet at the big red wind mill sculpture at Porter Square T stop.  Be on time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Crow Hill.  Find Leominster State Forest (www.state.ma.us/dem/parks/lmsf.htm).  Take route 2 to rt 31 south (exit 28) go south 1.3 miles to park head quarters. (get free climbing permit.) There are two Parking lots.  Go to the second parking lot on the left.  I wiill be in this Parking Lot at 10:45 AM - 11AM then head up the hill.  (Look for my small Silver Toyota.) If this parking lot isn't open - go further down and look on the right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geoff&lt;br /&gt;617 501-6217&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will wear a red shirt.
