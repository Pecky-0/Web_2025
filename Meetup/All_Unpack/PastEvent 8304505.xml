Many more people are engaged in the presidential election than in decades. People say this is the most interesting and engaged election they've experienced in their lifetime. At the same time, more and more of the American people  nationally, 35-40%  are calling themselves &amp;quot;independent.&amp;quot; Here in &lt;b&gt;MASS 49%&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of our voters&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are registered independent&lt;/b&gt;. And now, independents are getting organized! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obama and McCain both have the appeal of the Independently minded voter..&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent poll of Massachusetts shows that in a head to head matchup, Senator McCain and Senator Obama are tied.Do you agree? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are looking to do these casual conversations every month. So, if you can't make this one, please let me know if you would be opened to another one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Private room!
