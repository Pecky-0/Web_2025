Please bring any meditation accessories (cushion, bench, shawl, etc.)--plenty of chairs available. This week we may try a guided body-scan meditation, and also allow time for 30 minutes of open meditation where people can use whatever process works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All levels are welcome with some instruction available for beginners. A small donation is requested to cover expenses. Open to the public, bring friends if you want. Please show-up as close to 6pm if you can, we have to keep the front door locked and run downstairs to let people in, but it's definitely OK to show-up late if needed. Just ring the doorbell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Tom for more information by clicking on &amp;quot;email me&amp;quot; link.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be greeting people as they arrive.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233013200000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231254422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Mindfulness Meetup</name><id>9458092</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232406000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9458092/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
