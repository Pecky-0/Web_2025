<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;What better way to spend an October Saturday afternoon than being outdoors and watching a college football game with friends? The Brown Bears also have a pretty good team this year. Come watch them take on the Cornell Big Red in this midseason Ivy League matchup, with both teams coming in with a 3-2 record. &lt;span&gt;No athletic scholarships or overpaid coaches here; these are real students playing on real grass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at 12:15 PM at the ticket booth at the entrance to the main "home" side of Brown Stadium (with the concrete arches) near the corner of Sessions Street and Stadium Road. Kickoff is at 12:30. Everyone is responsible for getting their own ticket: prices are $15 for adults and $10 for children. The game won't sell out, so there is no need to get advance tickets unless you'd like to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
