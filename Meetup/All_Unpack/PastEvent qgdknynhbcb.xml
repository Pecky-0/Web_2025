<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>On Saturdays in May we will be holding outdoor volleyball QK doubles series. These are friendship tournament event meetups that are reverse coed doubles matches played in a King-Queen format, meaning that you will be playing with and against different people during pool play. Top players after pool play will compete in a playoff format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a friendship tournament format, meaning call your own faults, as there are no referees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizers for this event series will be Brian Lee and Matt BenDaniel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be using the ruleset listed in the first post on the following URL: &lt;a href="http://volleyball.meetup.com/122/messages/boards/thread/8548572"&gt;http://volleyball.mee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The events will start at 9 AM and will likely last at least until the early afternoon (~2 PM). If you would like to play in this event you must commit to staying at least through the end of pool play. Remember to bring snacks/food and water/beverages, as this event will involve a significant amount of volleyball play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is intended for players with experience playing reverse coed doubles format. Signup for these events is a little different. To sign up for one or more of these events, please send me an email using the following link on meetup: &lt;a href="http://volleyball.meetup.com/122/message/?recipientId=4774008"&gt;http://volleyball.mee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the email, provide the following information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Name&lt;br /&gt;Gender&lt;br /&gt;Event date(s) that you would like to sign up for&lt;br /&gt;Email address&lt;br /&gt;Cell phone number&lt;br /&gt;Outdoor rating (AA/A/BB/B), if you have one; otherwise, short description of reverse coed doubles experience&lt;br /&gt;Confirm that you have read the ruleset at the link above and that you agree to play by those rules.&lt;br /&gt;Confirm that you can commit to play from 9 AM to 2 PM.&lt;br /&gt;Signup partner name (if you have a signup partner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preferably, each player in a signup pair should send an email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this event we will have a strict cap of 16 players (8 men, 8 women) to simplify the event management. Preference is given to AA/A/BB players who sign up in male/female pairs, although some single signups will be allowed. Note that sending an email does not guarantee a spot to play; spots are only guaranteed if you are assigned a Yes RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt BenDaniel</member_name><member_id>1878223</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1272927792000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270589513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Outdoor (Sand) QK RevCoed Doubles Volleyball</name><id>qgdknynhbcb</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272718800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/13106563/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
