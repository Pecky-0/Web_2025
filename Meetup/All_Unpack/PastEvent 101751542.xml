RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT! &lt;br /&gt;

Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go hiking on the trails at Beaver Brook in Hollis NH. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two or three hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. This park is just full of beautiful views, so come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends. &lt;br /&gt;

NOTE !!!THIS IS A NEW MEET LOCATION!!!!We will meet at 2:00 pm in the parking lot entrance for Beaver Brook in Hollis NH, located at 117 Ridge Rd Hollis NH &lt;br /&gt;

DIRECTIONS: Take exit 6 from Route 3 (Route 130) and go west towards Brookline, stay on Route 130 (approximately 8 Â½ miles) and take a left on Route 122 (Main St), travel just under one mile and take a right under Ridge Rd, drive 1.2 mile to the main entrance to the park which will be on your right. Look for the meetup sign or my white Toyota Corolla. &lt;br /&gt;

Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

If anyone cares to, we can go grab a bite to eat afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;

This event is at no cost. I hope to see you there. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
