<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;quot;Wild Bees&amp;quot; is a 2001 comedy from the Czech Republic set in a small Northern Moravian village. 18 year old Kaja has a crush on Bozka, who works in the local grocery. Bozka however is enamoured with  Ladya who enjoys impersonating Michael Jackson. While this comedy veers towards absurdity, the underlying tone of the loss of tradition is always present.                                                                                                                                                              After the movie, we will walk to a Middle Eastern cafe on Huntington Ave  across from Northeastern ( about  a 10 minute walk) to discuss this movie. The food is good and the prices are very reasonable. When the movie is over, I will be holding up a sign that reads &amp;quot;Meet-Up&amp;quot; outside the box office.                                                                             General Admission is  $9.                                                         &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1157234734000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156004184000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wild Bees from the Czech Republic</name><id>5085950</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1157061600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5085950/</event_url></item>
