I &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; bring a digital camera to post a photo of the meeting on our Meetup web site IF participants grant permission &lt;i&gt;(please notify me of any privacy concerns)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7:30~9:00 pm&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;Decluttering Support: Round-table discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing of decluttering successes and inspirations, group problem-solving, buddying up, + input to future Meetups: group SUCCESSION, future meeting topics and schedule, venue, speakers, organizers, activities, resources: &lt;i&gt;how best to help YOU?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking&lt;/b&gt; available close by: On street parking is available on Homer Street, on the next block of Center Street just before Bow Street, and on Furber Lane behind the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public transportation:&lt;/b&gt; Take the Riverside (Green) line to Newton Centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;         ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For inspiration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lessons from a Goose: www.problogger.net/archives/2005/05/19/blogging-in-formation-lessons-from-a-goose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Seabiscuit documentary about the beloved &amp;quot;little brown racehorse&amp;quot; who became proxy for this nation during the Great Depression: anatomically comical in respects (an &amp;quot;equine catastrophe!&amp;quot;), with an abysmal track record as a colt, Seabiscuit appeared best suited for hauling ice carts. But a wise trainer caught a certain look in his eye and took him on ? inspiring generations. Tears well in my eyes as I watch Seabiscuit's spirit spark and then focus, head to head against the magnificent, seemingly invincible War Admiral ? and race &amp;quot;to parts unknown!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Batteries ? plain commodities vital for many applications: music, work (even &lt;i&gt;TASERS!&lt;/i&gt;). Each of us is like a battery: sometimes only one is needed for a job; usually more, to create synergy. Clutter MAY be a clue that more &amp;quot;batteries&amp;quot; are needed to complete a connection for the matter and energy stuck around us to flow again ? helping us do what we want MOST. How to better share the wealth we've collected and attract more batteries to &amp;quot;rock our world&amp;quot;? What's special about &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; stuff ? why keep it around? Might sharing about it help to release it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;i&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/i&gt; movie opening scene:  military risking their lives for our freedom to create value. (Also: &lt;i&gt;clutter can't fight back!&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Chocolate calcium &amp;quot;chews&amp;quot; vs. chalky tablets ? which do you suppose are used more often?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't attend, let us know your wishes ? and ideas to make declutteringmore FUN, increasing our chances for success ? such as (friendly) competitions for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- most $ earned by eBay/selling stuff&lt;br /&gt;- most creative way to reward oneself&lt;br /&gt;- the inspiration/strategy/technique/resource/organization/person most helpful for clearing clutter&lt;br /&gt;- most progress made decluttering&lt;br /&gt;- most value added to a space cleared of clutter&lt;br /&gt;- best use/home found for stuff&lt;br /&gt;- idea to make decluttering MOST FUN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?or find ways to best motivate YOU, to share at meetings or on our Message Board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who requested suggestions to start NOW ? how about analyzing what's accumulating: most related to security (finances, job, work), sentiment (mementos), projects (reminders of to-do's)??  Often much of a problem can be attributed to relatively few causes ? e.g., 20% of organizations sending us junk mail may be responsible for 80% of our clutter! Determine the Worst Offenders and remove our names from the mailing lists to TURN OFF THE SPIGOT of junk into our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resources I've found helpful include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Mike Nelson, &lt;i&gt;Stop Clutter from Stealing Your Life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Stephanie Winston's &amp;amp; Julie Morgenstern's books&lt;br /&gt;* David Allen&lt;i&gt;, Getting Things Done&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sallie Felton, www.salliefeltonlifecoach.com&lt;br /&gt;* Disaster Masters, www.disposophobia.com online e-book, &amp;quot;101 Strategies to Master the Clutter&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other resources (URLs, books, services) are on our Message Board. Thanks to Assistant Organizers Pamela, who set up our Board, and Marilyn, who has secured our venue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;IDEAS WELCOMED!&lt;/i&gt; You can often find me on Sunday late a.m.'s to brainstorm at:  www.cambridgepres.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                The portal of our sorrow can become our Gateway to Joy.  ?
