On her first-ever sojourn abroad, Sage Cohen spent three months traveling Mongolia with a bicycle. She spent the subsequent two summers there, traveling by four hooves and a thumb. This slide show (yes, real Kodak slides!) opens a view on the landscape, people and culture of this Central Asian land, including a composite of her many weeks exploring the country by horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage Cohen has become an intrepid traveler since her 40th birthday. She has traveled by bicycle in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India, China, Tibet, Latvia and Southeast Asia. Mongolia was her first love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to attend, please RSVP to Julie LePage at AMCBostonSlideshows@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to participate in the potluck at 6:30, feel free to use the following guidelines: Last names beginning with M-Z bring a main dish or side dish, last names beginning with A-L bring an appetizer or dessert.
