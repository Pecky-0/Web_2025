There are approximately 5000 dealers in 21 different show venues (often referred to as fields).  The show geographically covers one mile on each side of Route 20 and is a visual candy shop of photo opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be attending on Sunday 5/13. Plan to arrive early for good parking and fewer lines. We will be meeting at 8AM by the &amp;quot;No Pets&amp;quot; deer at the main show operators parking lot, the deer is located on the left as you approach the fair on route 20. If possible park in the lot where the deer is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the aforementioned deer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://photo.meetup.com/513/photos/153219/1297921/"&gt;http://photo.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a FAQ on the show with many tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brimfield.com/html/brimfieldfaqvisitors.htm"&gt;http://www.brimfield....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food is available from several vendors, yet lines can be long so bring a lunch - also bring water, hat, and sunscreen as you will be out in the hot sun.
