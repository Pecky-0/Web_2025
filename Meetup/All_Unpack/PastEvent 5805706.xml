We are sorry for the cancellation of May. We will plan to do it June 3rd. The back yard is nice and cool and a pool will be out for hot puppies.   We are undecided at this time when to have our garage sale. You have more time to clean out those closets and storage spaces....  Once again we are sorry that some people did not get the notice on May's meeting being canceled. Please check the site to make sure all is a go and the location is the same.  Sometimes the weather doesn't cooperate and sometimes things just get wacky.... Pug Hugs to All.. Please RSVP and if you are bringing snack or drink let us know.   &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181063053000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179849837000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup</name><id>5805706</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180890000000</time><rsvp_limit>500</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/5805706/</event_url></item>
