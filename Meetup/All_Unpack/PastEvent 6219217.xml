You'll be in, at no expense, for the full program--so come on out and clap for Dr. Paul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with tickets:  the pre-debate Reception is from 6 to 8 at the Lundholm Gym and you can pick up your tickets at the will-call counter there.  There will be another will-call counter at the Whittemore Center which will be open from 7 to 8:30.  The doors will close at 8:30 so you must be there before then.  The debate begins at 9 and ends at 10:30.  Remember to bring a picture ID with you to pick up your tickets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NH Debate will be held Sept 5th at the Whittemore Center at UNH.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189223860000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>107</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187721284000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NH GOP Rally &amp; Debate</name><id>6219217</id><headcount>89</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189027800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6219217/</event_url></item>
