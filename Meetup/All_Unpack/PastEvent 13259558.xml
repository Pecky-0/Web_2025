There's a great, local alternative where you can see future (and in some cases, former) Red Sox players in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us to see the Pawsox (the Red Sox minor league team) take on the Indianapolis Indians (the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league team) at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket.  If you're new to the area and haven't been to a Pawsox game, or if you're like so many of us, and have lived here for a while and been meaning to go, &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;this is your chance!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game is at 6:15, and we'll meet at 5:45 near the program booth by the front gate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to buy the tickets ahead of time so we can sit together in the reserved seats, so you'll need to RSVP and pay by Tuesday night.  Tickets are going to be $11.70 each and you'll pay using Paypal.  When you RSVP it will ask you for an email address.  I will then send the payment request to that email address.  This does not have to be the same email address you used on your meetup account.  This is just a one-time use from me to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are parking lots around the stadium charging $10/$5 per car, or you can try to find parking on one of the many side streets around the stadium.  WARNING: Please pay close attention to all of the street signs because they will ticket/tow if you park illegally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bring your glove to catch a foul ball, and help us cheer on our hometown boys.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet near the program booth by the front gate at 5:45.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephanie</member_name><member_id>8926850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272750513000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271955619000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pawtucket Red Sox vs. Indianapolis Indians</name><id>13259558</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272577500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/13259558/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/6/d/global_14555485.jpeg</photo_url></item>
