This event is also being posted on our other sites "Our Circle of Friends" and also "Improving Our Communities Together".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrance to this event costs a small donation plus a non-perishable food item. The write up by Living waters is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join us to HELP FIGHT HUNGER! For a small donation you will pick out a unique bowl that has been made/bought/recycled and keep that bowl as a reminder of all the empty bowls in this world. You will enjoy some homemade soups &amp;#150; made/donated and served by the Culinary St&amp;#133;udents of Greater Lowell Tech, Lowell HS&amp;#146;s Hospitality Academy, Nashoba Valley Tech., Nashua Tech Center, Chowder Factory and more&amp;#133;&amp;#133;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will also have a presentation, music and a raffle that includes local artist&amp;#146;s pieces, local business gift certificates, etc. This continues to grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ALL PROCEEDS FROM THIS EVENT TO BENEFIT &amp;#147;LIVING WATERS CENTER OF HOPE&amp;#148; and they in turn will be sharing a portion of the proceeds with the Merrimack Valley Food Bank!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This year, as well as a tax-deductible donation, you will be asked to bring a non-perishable food item for Merrimack Valley Food Bank&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
