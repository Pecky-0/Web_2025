I found some interesting single track trails out back that I'd like to explore more this time, apparently there is another trail map for that system.  So we'll have at least two groups, maybe three, especially if there are a few skaters.  This week's weather is holding below freezing so expect great conditions.  If there is bad weather check the meetup page before leaving to see if the time has changed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the Santa hat inside by the ticket counter....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232982633000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232395441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Brook Ski Touring</name><id>9557263</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232809200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/9557263/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
