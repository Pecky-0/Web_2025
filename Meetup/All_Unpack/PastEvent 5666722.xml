Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns on a blanket? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions while snacking and playing frisbee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us as SoJust kicks off our Summer events with Socializing for Justice on Boston Common for good ole' outdoor fun!  Blankets, food, frisbees, kids, dogs, musical instruments, games...If you can do it outside and you can share it with others, we'll be doing it.  All of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No program. No speaker. Just arrive and enjoy yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've been to the Common for demonstrations, rallies, festivals, but have you ever been just to socialize en mass?  Help us take over a grassy patch at the corner of Beacon and Charles Streets for outdoor family-friendly togetherness.  We're testing out the radical concept of assembling in public on blankets, with frisbees, for justice.  No loud speakers necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/204/457778563_760f8add09_m.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179853747000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176479417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Socializing for Justice on Boston Common</name><id>5666722</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179680400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/5666722/</event_url></item>
