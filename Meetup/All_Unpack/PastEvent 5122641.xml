The group will hike a route of around 6 miles. This is a &amp;quot;workout&amp;quot; hike! Bring water (a must!), a lunch or snacks, and bug spray. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow Hollow State Park and the adjoining Nipmuck State Forest offer over 9,000 acres of recreation opportunities, including miles of hiking trails and an 18-acre pond in Eastern Connecticut. This park is beautiful, and this is a great time of year to hike it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 10 AM at the I-84 exit 68 &amp;quot;park and ride&amp;quot; lot so we can carpool to save gas and to minimize the entrance fee. There is a $7 CT resident/$10 non-resident per car entrance fee to the park. We'll get to the park entrance by 10:30 AM. The hike takes about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO CELL reception at the park! If you'd like to drive directly to the park, let Michelle know and she can say where to go in the park to meet us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, please contact Michelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/bigelow.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/bigelow.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540518000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157897282000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Michelle's Hike at Bigelow Hollow</name><id>5122641</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1159624800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5122641/</event_url></item>
