We love all practitioners to come! We have Reiki going on in one room and Full Spectrum Healing in the other room. Come and get a healing too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really great fun, if you have never been please come along. We are really looking for Reiki Practitioners to come and work on the tables with us. We tend to get quite a lot of people at the Share (last month, we had about 70 people there) and we have every table we have out on the 2 rooms. We definitely need more Reiki people there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 donations gladly accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weds Feb 24th from 7-9pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEXT DATES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weds, April 14th&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, May 4th&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Campion</member_name><member_id>9185187</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271459871000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People interested in healing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Metrowest-Reiki-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1415890</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Metrowest Reiki and Energy Healers Share</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269954515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Healer Share</name><id>13035586</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271286000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Metrowest-Reiki-Meetup-Group/events/13035586/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/7/global_7810183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
