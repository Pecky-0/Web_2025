It's mainly a family-run operation, with an award winning wine list. Price ranges are: Antipasti $7-10, Pasta $16-25, Meat/Fish $21-30. If you're coming down Hanover Street from the Greenway, take your first right and you'll find it on the opposite side of Richmond Street. From 6:00-7:00 we'll be in Monica's Wine Bar, which is located next door to the restaurant, for our meet and greet. After dinner, for those with a little more time, we'll head to a North End cafe for coffee and dessert. So please try to join us for a summer evening in &amp;quot;Little Italy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: RSVP's are only being accepted for this event on Monday 7/26, Tuesday 7/27 and up to 4:00 PM on Wednesday 7/28.
