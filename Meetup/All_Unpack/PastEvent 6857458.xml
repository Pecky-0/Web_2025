<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ok folks, here we go. This will be our first meeting in January. More will be added if necessary but this is the big one. We need to bring as many meetup members as humanly possible to this event so that various project coordinators can get volunteers to help them with the final push leading up to the primaries. We will also need to tap these people to hold signs at various polling places in their area on the fifth so the more the better because we might be able to cover polling places that aren't specifically represented. I'm putting the onus on you to get people from your respective meetups to show up for this meeting. I will work on the rest of the state. Let's do this thing! Please get this event on your individual calendars as soon as possible and encourage people to be there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200009998000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196816756000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul Connecticut Statewide Coordination Group Meetup</name><id>6857458</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199836800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/6857458/</event_url></item>
