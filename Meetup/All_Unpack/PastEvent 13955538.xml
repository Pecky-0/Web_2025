<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So many of us have July 5th off from work to observe the 4th... why not give or dogs an extra bit of holiday and take them to the beach?  Stodders Neck is located in Hingham, close to Bare Cove Park.  Lets meet inside the park entrance to start our walk.  There is plenty of routes that will take us down to the water where the dogs can play in the water and cool off.  If you have never been here, please note that the &amp;quot;beach&amp;quot; is rocky, not sandy, so you probably won't be interested in taking a dip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a special treat, Proportions, our sponsor, has sent dog food samples for members.  I'll bring the box to this walk so you can give it a try.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is information on getting there and reviews of the park.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/local/MA/Hingham/Dog_Parks/Stodders_neck-58201" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dogster.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278342592000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277863445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Home from work next Monday?
