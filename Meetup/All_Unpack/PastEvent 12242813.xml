We will hike at a pace of our slowest hiker.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all  have our own individual pace and many organizers offer many levels of hiking to give you options of the level and pace that is comfortable for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail leaves from the Downes Brook parking area just east of Passaconaway Campground and 13.5 miles west of Conway on the Kancamagus Highway. The trail takes you to the summit of Mt. Hedgehog (2520'). The grade is moderate and only the final sections require a little extra effort. The advantage in taking the loop in a clockwise direction is to view the Presidential Range and Mt. Washington as you reach the summit from the South.  &lt;br /&gt;Hedgehog is strikingly shaped with Allen's Ledge on the north, and the huge East ledges on Little Hedgehog. The vantage point from Allen's Ledge, located 1.1 miles up the west fork of the trail, affords remarkable views of Mt. Passaconaway, Mt. Chocorua, the Moats, the presidential Range, the Carrigain Range, and many other eastern peaks. On a clear day even the observatory on top of Mt. Washington is visible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential Info  &lt;br /&gt;Mileage:  &lt;br /&gt;4.8 miles compete loop  &lt;br /&gt;east ledges 2.0 miles  &lt;br /&gt;Hedgehog summit 2.9 mile  &lt;br /&gt;Difficulty: Easy to Moderate  &lt;br /&gt;Loop elevation range: 1250'-2532'  &lt;br /&gt;Estimated time: 5 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be prepared for winter conditions.

Some type of foot traction is required (e.g. crampons, microspikes, etc).  &lt;br /&gt;The Hiker Responsibility Code is a set of principles that all hikers can look to before they hit the trail. Similar to the Skier's Responsibility Code endorsed by the National Ski Areas Association, the Hiker Responsibility Code was created to help hikers become more self aware about their responsibility for their own safety every time they are on a hike. It also acknowledges the inherent danger of hiking in the backcountry, and encourages hikers to be better prepared every time they are on the trail. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264774180000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262807568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Hedgehog</name><id>12242813</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264343400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12242813/</event_url></item>
