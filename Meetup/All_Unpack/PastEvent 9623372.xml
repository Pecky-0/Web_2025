Folks should bring knitting, and can bring any food type offerings they'd like - but not mandatory, since if everyone brings something, we'll have way too much!.  I have some parking concerns since there is so much snow!  There is guest parking in immediate vicinity for 4 cars, and more scattered around the development.  I think people sometimes park on side of road around circle, but that maybe hard now - maybe we can see how it is when we get closer. If attendance is large, we might have to ask people to car pool... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 am or later.  Not sure how many go to church, etc. unitl whenever.. &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235604696000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233190051000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Brunch at Joans! -February 22</name><id>9623372</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235314800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/9623372/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/global_7110326.jpeg</photo_url></item>
