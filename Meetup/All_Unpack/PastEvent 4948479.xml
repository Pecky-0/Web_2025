After chatting with a few people I have narrowed the next meeting's topic list down to the following items:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Podcasts – Do people listen? What are people’s favorites?  Let's share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. My experiences with Linux – Installation and basics for new users using Ubuntu.  I will bring some nice cheat sheets to get non-Linux users up and going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. What is happening on Slashdot, Reddit and Digg these days.  There is always some interesting news that we can discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to hopefully seeing some new faces and definitely the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always please do not hesitate to contact me with any comments or questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that &amp;quot;Other Side Cafe&amp;quot; on Newbury received some good comments on meetup.com I am interested to see if it is a good meeting place.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brunswick</member_name><member_id>1794538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Technology Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>web-8</urlname><id>215777</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Computing Review Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1148417440000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Podcasts, Linux and News</name><id>4948479</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150048800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/web-8/events/4948479/</event_url></item>
