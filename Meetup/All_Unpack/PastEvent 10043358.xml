It's been held at the beach for several years now and each year, it's more and more popular.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The week-long event begins on July 10th with setup continuing the whole week to the evening of July 17th.  On July 18th, there are festivities and judging.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Photo Ops:&lt;br /&gt;Early morning, you'll find the sculptors working on their creations.  It's a quiet and peaceful time to go take photos.  Evenings are quite good for taking some dramatic night shots of the sculptures.  They are well-lit and there are a number of vantage points to get some good shots.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a possibility the city of Revere will be sponsoring fireworks at some point during the week -- most likely, Friday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be sending out additional information the week before the event to confirm the exact time for judging and awards as well as fireworks.  I'll also send my cell phone number for those attending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact me early in the week if you want to come out for an evening shoot.  If I'm available, I'll hook up with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've included some photos from last year's event.  You can also visit the Revere Beach website for more info.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>As you face the ocean, we'll meet at the pavilion to the left of the bandstand.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>5274985</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250345297000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238097551000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach Sand Castles</name><id>10043358</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247925600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/10043358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/2/global_7847026.jpeg</photo_url></item>
