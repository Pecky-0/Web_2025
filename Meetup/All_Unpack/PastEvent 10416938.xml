<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So back in Wisconsin I was a regular at a local cover band - I used to go out dancing every Tuesday night.  And when I talk dancing, I don't mean the skeezy bump and grind, but I mean full-on dancing-home-in-front-of-the-mirror karaaaaazy dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, though this is not a live-music dancing venue, it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt; a kickin' rad place to get your 80s grooves on!  No better workout, no better way to blow off steam, and no better way to ramp you up for the weekend than throwin down and rockin out on a Thursday night.  The first time we went was a blast, but because of the Bruins game we got a late start - this time we should be right on time!  The bar serves food till 11, too, so if you work up an appetite there'll be plenty to nosh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***note - last time we didn't need to pay a cover cuz we got there early enough, but i'd bring $5 or so for a cover just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you're lucky, you may just see a reappearance of the sweatband...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP for details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246146387000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242361409000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>80s Night at the Common Ground in Allston</name><id>10416938</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244770200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10416938/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/4/9/global_8281609.jpeg</photo_url></item>
