<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>KING RICHARD'S FAIRE, in it's 28th season, is a vivid recreation of a 16th century English marketplace at festival time. Actors, dancers, puppeteers, jugglers, minstrels, mimes, magicians and musicians perform each weekend for the favor of his Royal Highness King Richard. &lt;br /&gt;Royalty and beggars, highwaymen and guards, knights and wenches, swordsmen and soothsayers roam throughout the 80 acre wooded village while artisans hawk and display a wide array of unique hand-made wares. The Royal Chefs prepare delectable edibles authentic to Renaissance times. Exotic animals, jousting knights on horseback, challenging games and Renaissance merriment round out a day at The Faire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: $26.00 ( coupons may be downloaded from their website and MAY? also be found in &lt;br /&gt;The Boston Globe on Thuirs and Sundays) &lt;br /&gt;WEBSITE: www.kingrichardsfaire.net &lt;br /&gt;** Much more info about the faire can be found on the site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***NOTE: I have the meetup time at 12:00 noon.
