The seminar is titled &amp;quot;Exploring the Spiritual Frontier&amp;quot; and it is being presented by local students of Eckankar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our workshop you'll learn what the secret worlds are, where they exist, what you might find in each, and how you can benefit from them. You'll experience techniques for contacting your inner worlds and identify keys to greater awareness of them. The workshop is 2 hours, and participants will have plenty of time for group discussion to share their experiences and ask questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or would like more information, please email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Isabelle and Bob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Through the front doors, straight ahead down the hall, registration to your left, and meeting room to your right.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabelle Morton</member_name><member_id>10332926</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Morton</member_name><member_id>10808254</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278772929000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278186987000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Keys to Secret Worlds</name><id>13993863</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278768600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/13993863/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/2/global_11631042.jpeg</photo_url></item>
