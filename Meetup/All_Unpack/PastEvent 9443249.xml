<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that alot of us got to meet each other, I am setting up a Dance/Rock band night.  I am scheduling the night at the StoneBridge in Milford.  They are having a Local 70's to top 40 band there.  This band is awsome.  The band name is &lt;a href="http://www.timelesstheband.net" target="_blank"&gt;Timeless. &lt;/a&gt; They are one of the best bands in this area by far.  StoneBridge is in Milford, right near a beautiful stream.

I hope you catch one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be a blood pumping night, so, I would like to invite everyone.  This band is really good to just watch, or dance to.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2 nominal fee raffle goes towards the bands T-SHIRT.
