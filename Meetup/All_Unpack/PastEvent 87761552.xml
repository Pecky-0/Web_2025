However, it's likely that each of these pieces was developed independently and at different times in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will attempt to answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) What are your financial needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) What are the necessary elements of a good financial plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) How do different parts of your financial plan fit together to help you reach your goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First meeting in a series of meetings on Financial Planning. We'll meet at the Arlington Public Library Conference room (there is only one in the library).&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351212401000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350695871000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Financial Planning for Everyone!</name><id>87761552</id><duration>8100000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351204200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/87761552/</event_url></item>
