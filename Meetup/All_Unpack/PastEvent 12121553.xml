Her new book, All Things at Once, is part memoir and part rallying cry for women to pursue the vocation, be it work or family or both, that best fulfills them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In this straightforward, frank account of her career trajectory, Brzezinski, the daughter of President Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, does not bother to disguise her hard-fought ambition to secure a top news anchor position or hide the fact that she is not satisfied (nor very good at) being a stay-at-home mom of two daughters. From the beginning of her TV career, working her way up at local affiliates in Hartford, to her big break, getting hired in 1997 for an overnight CBS network anchor program in New York, Up to the Minute, the author resolved to make the frantic pace work, despite the increasing toll the late hours and absences from her family were taking. Distracted, pressured to return too early to work after the birth of her second child and exhausted, she took a bad fall down the stairs of her Yonkers home while holding her infant. The trauma scared her into slowing down, but not for long. Opportunity has seasoned Brzezinski but not hardened her, and having found her venue and voice with Morning Joe, she shares a refreshingly pragmatic approach for the professional woman.&amp;quot; â€”Publishers Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Info:&lt;br /&gt;617.661.1515&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media:&lt;br /&gt;617.661.1424 ex.1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email:&lt;br /&gt;rbcass@harvard.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Event Information&lt;br /&gt;DATE:  Friday, January 8th&lt;br /&gt;TIME:  6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION:  Brattle Theatre&lt;br /&gt;40 Brattle Street&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge&lt;br /&gt;TICKETS:  $5 tickets are ON SALE NOW, and are available for purchase online at harvard.com, at Harvard Book Store, and over the phone with a credit card (617.661.1515).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mika Brzezinski is an MSNBC anchor and co-host of MSNBC's Morning Joe.
