Hard to believe these gentlemen have real jobs, did you know one of them is actually a dentist by day?? True! And all nice folks.&lt;br /&gt;So...please watch for a new date, just waiting to hear back from the hall manager. This is as tricky as planning a wedding. But, when it happens it should be alot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime...we are meeting at Backstage Grille in Tewksbury. The management there was very accomodating last time and even reserved a special area just for us. Jill and Karen are planning the event and we all hope you can join us. A new band called &amp;quot;Scortch&amp;quot; will be providing the dance music and their play list sounds great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let us know in your response if you would like to meet earlier at 8 for dinner. They claim to have great sirloin tips! Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231723907000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231111704000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PARTY ALTERNATIVE...</name><id>9443785</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231551000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/9443785/</event_url></item>
