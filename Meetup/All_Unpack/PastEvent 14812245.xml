There is an entrance fee but it is well worth the price of admission since they have the 100 seat Alden Digital Planetarium that will allow you to see views of the night sky plus hear a talk before the actual Sky Watch. They also serve plenty of munchies and have the Aldrich Astronomical Society, Inc. members help with outdoor observing using Ecotarium telescopes and telescopes supplied by the members of the Aldrich Society. If you always wanted to learn something about the night sky, this is a great way to get introduced to the night sky from your own Backyard.  If any families would like to attend, I always bring handouts for the audience and have plenty of materials that can be used in the classroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;NOTE&lt;/u&gt; : There is also a Comet visible to the unaided eye during October so this will be an added attraction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website is &lt;b&gt;www.ecotarium.org&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Jim J. Zebrowski&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five Moons over Worcester&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, October 14&lt;br /&gt;7:00 - 8:30 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View the crescent moon, along with the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. Double Stars Albireo and Gamma Andromeda should also be standouts tonight. Then itâ€™s time for some galactic action, starting with M31 in Andromeda, an equal to the Milky Way with more than 750 billion solar masses, a double nucleus and a 140 million mass black hole! Learn about our future gravitational interaction with this massive galaxy, which has devoured scores of neighbors. And meet M33 in Triangulum, one survivor of a close call!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim J.
