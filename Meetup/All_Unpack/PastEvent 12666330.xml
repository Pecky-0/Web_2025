The first two had about 60 people, so come on out and join the fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be held at Janice's condo complex clubhouse (a.k.a. the hall) in South Windsor. We'll have an large fireplace with fire, music, tables &amp;amp; chairs, bathrooms, and full kitchen available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Games: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the games we have already: &lt;br /&gt;* Pictionary &lt;br /&gt;* Picture Picture &lt;br /&gt;* Worst Case Scenario &lt;br /&gt;* Trivial Pursuit &lt;br /&gt;* Scrabble &lt;br /&gt;* Fact or Crap &lt;br /&gt;* Jenga (well a knockoff version) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd like to see someone bring these as well as anything else: &lt;br /&gt;* Bolderdash &lt;br /&gt;* Cranium &lt;br /&gt;* Cards (for various card games)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring any other game you might think 4 - 6 people at least could play at the same time. Team games would be great too. Note this is an indoor game night. We are not doing horseshoes or lawn darts!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplied already: &lt;br /&gt;* Paper and glass products &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan to bring to share any of: &lt;br /&gt;* Finger food &lt;br /&gt;* Snacks &lt;br /&gt;* Small entree (plan to feed 8 people!) &lt;br /&gt;* Drinks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hall Rental Donation &lt;br /&gt;We would appreciate donations of any amount (maybe $2 - $5 each person?) to help offset the cost of the hall rental. Donations can be made at the event. (We really appreciated the donations at the last Feb. event and we were able to cover the rental. Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at a hall at a condo complex in South Windsor. The address will be sent to those who respond &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; about a couple days before the event. If you sign up last minute be sure to e-mail Janice or Kevin for directions. Limitation on RSVP's is due to parking limitations. We all hope you can attend and enjoy a warm evening with great people. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268089596000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266790192000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck and Games Night</name><id>12666330</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267916400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/12666330/</event_url></item>
