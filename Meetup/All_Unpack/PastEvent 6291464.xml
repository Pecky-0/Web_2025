Shot in wide-screen and saturated primary colors, mainly in the south of France, Pierrot looks sensational... The movie itself radiates joy of cinema.&amp;quot; - J. Hoberman, The Village Voice &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After abandoning his wife at a Parisian party, bored Ferdinand (Belmondo) flees his bourgeois existence with his babysitter and ex-lover, Marianne (Karina). Taking it on the lam to the south of France, the couple becomes an existential Bonnie and Clyde, battling gunrunners, gas station attendants, and American tourists as they come face to face with their own roles as characters in a pop-cultural landscape. A profound turning point in Godard's cinema, Pierrot le fou recalls the gangster cool of Breathless and Band of Outsiders while also pointing towards the increasingly essayistic, apocalyptic visions of Two or Three Things I Know About Her and Weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater during the credits. After the movie, we'll head off to a local eatery for discussion. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190139873000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188855819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jean Luc Godard's Pierrot Le Fou</name><id>6291464</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189966500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6291464/</event_url></item>
