In this roundtable, a presentation of Tufts CSDD findings will be followed by specific examples of strategies in biotech, pharmaceutical and academic institutions. Created in 2008, The Tufts CSDD Executive Forum is the only program of its kind.  Quarterly roundtable discussions, held in a facilitated and interactive small group format, offer senior pharmaceutical and biotechnology company executives an opportunity to share ideas and experiences in R&amp;amp;D strategy, management, and practice.
