<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Dear Members,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past summer months, our core cast has trained and performed together in a variety of settings. Several of you have expressed interest in participating, and some of you have come to a few of our rehearsals. As we are set to begin a new training repertoire, the doors open to members interested in getting involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few weeks, we will work on fundamental skills in improvisation, going over concepts such as accepting offers, dos and don'ts, storytelling, character development, being attuned to the momentum of a scene, mime, and listening to your partner. Much of this training is a reinforcement of concepts covered during the cast's initial training period. However, some new concepts will be introduced. Rehearsals will be conducted in an open, inclusive manner that enables new participants to integrate with the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New members are asked to come with previous experience in improv, theater, or the performing arts. Whether participants ultimately join the cast as ongoing performers depends on each individual's skill level and compatibility with cast chemistry. If you don't make it to the stage immediately, though, don't worry! It may simply take you some time to fully assimilate the finer points of volunteer improvisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, come out for an evening of fun, laughs, and improvisation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252628269000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Rehearsal--A New Beginning</name><id>11342779</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253313000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/11342779/</event_url></item>
