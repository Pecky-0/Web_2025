Scenic views of rolling grasslands, grazing livestock, ancient stone walls, tree-lined carriage paths, and historic farm buildings are all part of the legacy of nine generations of Appleton family members kept alive through the work of The Trustees of Reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six miles of footpaths, bridle paths, and farm roads (easy walking), some of which are part of the Bay Circuit Trail.  I am not sure about dogs - I think you need a &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; pass.  Check the contact info below. I suggest waterproof footwear as this is &amp;quot;mud season.&amp;quot;   We will walk for about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/249_appleton_farms.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;   There is a $3 parking fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Headquarters: Appleton Farms  219 County Road, Ipswich, MA 01938   978-356-5728&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will meet at the Waldingfield Road Parking area - near the intersection of County Road.&lt;/b&gt;   If you Mapquest 219 County Road, Ipswich it will get you close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the South take I-95N to Rt 128N, take exit 20A and follow Route 1A north for about 7 mi.
