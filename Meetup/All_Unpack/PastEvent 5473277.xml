Tradition says, however, that permission was denied by captain Ephraim Flint, who owned the pond and the site Thoreau desired, and who had doubtless heard about the extensive accidental forest fire Thoreau had set by Fairhaven Bay.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hiked the trail around Flint's Pond and it is a really nice place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 10:30 am in the parking lot of the Lincoln Public Schools Campus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Public Schools Campus&lt;br /&gt;Ballfield Road &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln, MA&lt;br /&gt;01773-3211&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 2 to Bedford Road South, Ballfield Road is 1 mile south of Trapello on the left.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a ride please ask for one in your rsvp, saying what neighborhood you live in.  If you can't find a ride that way, I can pick you up at Riverside T.  Email me if you want me to pick you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My phone # is 781-439-2572.  Please have my phone number with you in case you get lost or are running late.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we will have lunch at Bison County, 275 Moody Street, Waltham 781-642-9720.
