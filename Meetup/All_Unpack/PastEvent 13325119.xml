That's the question. Well, that's probably the first of many questions. If you want the answers, then come to our May meeting for Catcher in the Rye. Catcher in the Rye was actually our second place book for April's meeting [we ended up reading Catch 22....not sure if that was a good thing or not. ;-) ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it made sense to read it for May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, join us on May 26th at Stella Blue in Nashua. We'll do our usual 12 person cap so RSVP quickly as these meetings can fill up in one or two days. Also, if you do RSVP Yes, but your plans change, please update your RSVP as soon as possible so another person can join us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the end of May!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274962991000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272504385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Is there a Holden Caulfield among us?</name><id>13325119</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274914800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/13325119/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
