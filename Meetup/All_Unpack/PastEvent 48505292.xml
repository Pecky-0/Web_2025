She will give an hour-long presentation about &amp;ldquo;The Stories of Knitting&amp;rdquo; in which she explores the fascinating world of knitting, past and present, through stories. Kathy&amp;rsquo;s presentation is enhanced with photographs, knitted items and antiques from her collection. The themes include: lessons from our grandmothers, the courage of women, and the importance to our culture of domesticity. The talk will explore the history of knitting and looks ahead to the future of this craft and the unusual and inspiring things people are knitting today. &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;ldquo;Stories teach us new things, show us who we are and bind us together,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy Goldner. When Kathy began knitting after a fifteen year hiatus, she discovered armloads of knitting books with wonderful knitting stories and wanted to listen to them while she knit. It was this love of stories which prompted her to start Knitting Out Loud.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carrie Kelley</member_name><member_id>12068098</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327242410000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326834832000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Stories of Knitting - Kathy Goldner</name><id>48505292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327159800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/48505292/</event_url></item>
