This time at The Eastern Standard in Kenmore Square.... located at 528 Commonwealth Ave., inside the Commonwealth Hotel. Here's an Editorial Review for Eastern Standard â€“ by Eric Grossman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a bistro on steroids, Eastern Standard provides its patrons, many of whom are well-heeled out-of-towners, with a bevy of seating options. While there's an exceptionally lengthy marble bar and a stylish private room, most diners stick to the high-ceilinged dining room's red leather booths or seating on Kenmore Square's largest sidewalk patio. Courteous servers patrol all corners, and given the restaurant's mammoth size, it guarantees a quiet, relaxing spot for a business breakfast or lunch. In short, the menu leans towards straightforward comfort fare and fresh seafood, with several eye-catching oddities thrown into the mix. Standout items include stellar mussels (in tomato, fennel and white wine broth), salt cod fritters, roasted bone marrow, sage-roasted chicken, and juicy bistro burgers. Homemade sorbet and authentic Cinnamon sugar zeppole prove popular among desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insider Tips - What to Drink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar whips up some impressive house drinks, including a rum punch with pomegranate juice. Also, there's an exceptionally affordable wine list that includes several bargain bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Star Rating: Recommended. Great ambiance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP first</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241059365000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235169704000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drinks and Early Dinner at the Eastern Standard in Kenmore</name><id>9786261</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240174800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9786261/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/2/global_7612594.jpeg</photo_url></item>
