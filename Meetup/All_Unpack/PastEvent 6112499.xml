The film deals with difficult subject matter. I hope many group members  agree- some of the better  discussions have been provided by movies that aren't neccessarily  a good-time. The &amp;quot;good-time&amp;quot; is our discussion afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is England     &lt;br /&gt;  Nominated for Best Director and Screenplay at the 2006 British Independent Film  Awards  Shane Meadows (&amp;quot;Dead Man's Shoes&amp;quot;) wrote and directed this semi-autobiographical drama about a fatherless 12-year-old boy whose salty attitude endears him to Woody (Joseph Gilgun), the leader of a relatively benign group of skinheads in an early 1980s British seaside town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while, young Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is having the time of his life, but when racist ex-con Combo (Stephen Graham) shows up and draws Sean into far more dangerous gambits than vandalizing abandoned buildings, the kid is going to grow up faster than he could have imagined.

I'll probably be refraining from ordering Fish n Chips after this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187122576000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186016809000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>This is England- A Skinhead's Tale</name><id>6112499</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186949700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6112499/</event_url></item>
