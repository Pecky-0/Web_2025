Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/rpga/downloads/LFR_CharGenGd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wizards.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least one table is going to run, and that table will be running an H3 adventure (levels 7-10, title TBD).  Unfortunately, due to a shortage of DM's, I will have a backup event for the other table but that is dependent on whether or not the backup option comes through (I'm working on it guys and gals, so hang in there).  As it stands now, I'll bring Three Dragon Ante with me for those interested in something D&amp;amp;D related but non-LFR.  If something changes before Wednesday, I'll be sure to update it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, if anyone is interested in running some kind of event during this time slot on a non-Encounter week, please message me so we can make it happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293667767000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293482064000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms &amp; Three Dragon Ante</name><id>15830715</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293663600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15830715/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
