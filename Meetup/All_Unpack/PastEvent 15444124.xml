There are a bunch of spurs on the trail that I haven't really explored, so I might as well use this as an opportunity to see where they go.  This won't be a fast ride - I just want to see what's around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blackstone River Bikeway is 10 miles of paved bike path from Lincoln through Valley Falls Heritage Park in Cumberland and ends in Woonsocket at the Water Treatment Plant on Manville Hill Road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at The Blackstone River State Park, Front Street, Lincoln. To find us: pull into the address listed above, go down the road for maybe a mile and we'll be at the first parking lot on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are fewer than FOUR YES rsvps, I'll probably cancel.  If it's supposed to rain/snow or be very cold, I will cancel.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a guy on a red bike with a red car or try my cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292095192000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289762699000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BIKING/Exploring the Blackstone on Sunday!</name><id>15444124</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290366000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/15444124/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/7/global_10591671.jpeg</photo_url></item>
