(And no doubt imbibing some warm spirits too!) At our January meetup, we primitive winter bike commuters, along with our perhaps more civilized peers from &lt;a href="http://www.portlandgreenstreets.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Portland Green Streets&lt;/a&gt;, will carry on the tradition! But don't worry, we'll be inside!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your best bike-related story or memory: How you got started, why you love cycling, your biggest adventure, your best childhood memory, that time you and your cycling buddy did that really stupid thing, whatever. Purchase a cuppa whatever from Homegrown Herb &amp;amp; Tea and cozy in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will try to wrap it up by 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232148825000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229742356000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Storytelling Circle</name><id>9366406</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231975800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/9366406/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/2/global_2949602.jpeg</photo_url></item>
