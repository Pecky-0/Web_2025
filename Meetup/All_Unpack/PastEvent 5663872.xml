Perhaps it will still feel like the weekend if we are outside?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mickeysgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mickeysgro...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for our first happy hour at Mickey's, which got a great &lt;a href="http://www.ctnow.com/dining/reviews/hc-flavorrev0315.artmar15,0,5415625.story?coll=hce-headlines-diningrevs" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in the Hartford Courant which concluded, &amp;quot;No matter the weather or the threat of an impending Nor'easter, they absolutely should: This more-than-just-a-good-neighborhood joint is a flawless winner, across the board.&amp;quot;  Though it's in Hamden, it's just a short trip up Whitney Avenue, and I hope you'll all like it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be in the lounge area.  I hope we can go again in the summer to take advantage of their patio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPECIALS: &lt;br /&gt;They are extending their happy hour until 7:30 or 8 pm for the NHC&lt;br /&gt;$5.00/glass for 5 kinds of wine &lt;br /&gt;$2.50 bud/bud light&lt;br /&gt;$2.00 appetizers--the manager said they are big--include stuffed potato skins, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact:&lt;br /&gt;Karen 203-535-8751&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177538668000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176405707000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Happy Hour 4/23 at Mickey's</name><id>5663872</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177365600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5663872/</event_url></item>
