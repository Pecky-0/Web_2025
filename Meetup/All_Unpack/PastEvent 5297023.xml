This bar is &lt;br /&gt;located at 138 Brighton Ave, Brighton, at the corner of harvard avenue and brighton avenue, it is on the second floor above the sunset tap grill restaurant. (617-782-2020)&lt;br /&gt;Would you like to join us? E and I have also proposed to the persons of our last meeting (R, H, A) so it could be an opportunity to meet us again before the Christmas vacation.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This will NOT be a regular Meetup but is an informal social gathering- hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to suggest other activities too!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. December Meetup- should we reschedule?&lt;br /&gt;It is scheduled for 12/28 Thursday, a busy time betweeen Christmas (12/25) and New Year's Eve (12/31). Would it be better to reschedule it to early January? What's your opinion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Message board:&lt;br /&gt;During the holidays, if anyone would like to meet, we can post messages on the message board to suggest activities. For example, on 12/31, New Year's Eve, there are a lot of events downtown, and you can walk around with the crowds on Boston Common. If you would like to attend, you can post on the message board to find other people to go with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other suggestions? Please post on the Message Board!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes, &lt;br /&gt;Reece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165194300000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164818251000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>This Friday eve 12/1 at "Big City" bar, Allston</name><id>5297023</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165021200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/5297023/</event_url></item>
