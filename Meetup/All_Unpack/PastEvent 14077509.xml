Very pretty for a muni-course.  We have tee times at 10:09, 10:18 this Sunday.  Pro shop did me a favor of blocking 3 tee times earlier than generally allowed.  They stressed that we should let them know as soon as possible if not all the spots are filled.  So pls avoid no-show or last-minute cancellation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green fees are $46 + $17 cart fee for non-residents.  And I'll collect $1 from everyone for meetup website fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have 6 players.  Let's meet at 9:55 outside the Pro shop.  See you soon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zhen</member_name><member_id>2286378</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1287855014000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>golf-260</urlname><id>1127024</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2200012207</group_lon><name>The Boston and Beyond Golf Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278951940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday - Braintree Muni</name><id>14077509</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279461600000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/golf-260/events/14077509/</event_url></item>
