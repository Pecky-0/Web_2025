I just finished it and it has all the qualities of a great novel including the quirky aspect that it is told from a dog's point of view...a dog with great intellect, wisdom and an endearing world view.  Don't be fooled; it's not light reading as it deals with death, betrayal and the complications of family life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August we discussed the second book in the Millenium Trilogy, &amp;quot;The Girl Who Played with Fire&amp;quot;.  Our discussion revolved around the morality of Lisbeth's choices.  The hour flew by as we analyzed Lisbeth and whether we agreed with her actions.  Much time was spent on Larrson, himself, and the overall message he was trying to convey throughout the three books.  Those of us who have read book three tried very hard not to ruin it for those who haven't gotten to it yet!  It was tempting to spill some final secrets but we refrained.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you all can join us on September 26.
