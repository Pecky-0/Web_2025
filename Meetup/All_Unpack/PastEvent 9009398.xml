Downtown Nashua, NH will become a destination for thousands of residents and visitors who flock to the city in celebration of the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year’s Stroll theme “Traditions of the Season” was selected to honor the abundant and diverse customs celebrated by all who will attend the 2008 Stroll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full menu of events is scheduled which includes dozens of performance acts, a visit by Santa Claus and a wide variety of children’s and community activities. Many downtown businesses stay open for the Stroll, welcoming Strollers to explore the unique retail offerings of the district. Performing acts, both indoor and outdoor, will fill the night air with music and entertainment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about the Winter Holiday Stroll, call Great American Downtown at (603)883-5700 or visit www.NashuaStroll.com.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in front of the library.
