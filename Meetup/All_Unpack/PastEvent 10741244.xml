I know most of you may be waiting for the last minute because of the weather or maybe another reason.  But please try to call in to reserve your spot by Wednesday at the latest.  When you have can you please put on this site that you have called in your spot, so we can also get an actual count of who's coming.  Unfortunately we will not be able to get the discount at this time, and they will be charging your card as early as 8/5. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again sorry for the change in plans, we are still hoping that you will be joining us it should be a great day and let's get out on the beautiful water and enjoy the day! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience the comfort and excitement of sailing aboard the river's only commercial sailing catamaran. Take the helm if you wish! The Ninth Wave sails out of the Merrimack River. We are docked at the far west end of the Newburyport waterfront boardwalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our voyage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of our tours include a cruise of the Newburyport waterfront after which we will leave the harbor and raise sails in the open ocean, heading north or south along the coast as the wind dictates. We encourage our passengers to take an active role in the handling of the boat: raise the main, trim the sails or take the helm under the tutelage of our experienced captain and crew, while learning about the region's colorful past and looking at the natural history of our rich marine environment. Please understand that sail times are approximate because we cannot control the conditions and sailing is not an exact science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket cost is: **$31.00 (please see below there will be a discount given to the amount of tickets that are&lt;br /&gt;sold to our group)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you need to know about this meetup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----Don't hesitate to call in a reservation, the boat is not reserved just for our group so it will fill up fast. &lt;br /&gt;----When calling in your reservation, tell them you are reserving a spot on &amp;quot;Donna meetup&amp;quot;.
