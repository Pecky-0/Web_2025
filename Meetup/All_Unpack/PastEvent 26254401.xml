Meet at the New Shanghai Restaurant on Hudson St. Sorry, Borders closed unexpectedly early. We'll have dinner at 7:30 so come prepared. 
&lt;p&gt;Our "Speed Chinese" seemed to be a good success last time though we still need some practice to get the flow right ;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to try it again!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Small group conversations to get everyone talking and listening and have a chance to talk to lots of people.&amp;nbsp; ALL LEVELS WELCOME!!!&amp;nbsp; This format is probably even better suited to beginners so please don't hesitate to join us!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next evening meet up will be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCATION: Borders Books store in downtown boston (Take the T to downtown boston, 
&lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com"&gt;www.mbta.com&lt;/a&gt;.)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIME: from 6:30 to 8:30PM. Food and drinks available here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Some people often head over to C-town for dinner as a&amp;nbsp;group afterwards.&amp;nbsp; All are welcome to join us so If you have any interest in that please make sure to have enough cash to cover yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to bring books, course work, or anything you want to share with the group. All levels are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP responsibly. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Upstairs in the cafe, probably have chinese books on the table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken</member_name><member_id>3595685</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312042992000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311072735000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday evening chinese/english language exchange group</name><id>26254401</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1311805800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/26254401/</event_url></item>
