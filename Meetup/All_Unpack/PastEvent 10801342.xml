We would arrive on later than Saturday September 5th and depart on Saturday September 12th.  I have posted this trip already in the New York Backpackers site and I wanted to invite anyone would like to come from this group to join me. I need strong backpackers. No novices. The group size for Banff is 10. At the moment I have 4 people going for sure. So there are 6 more spots left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the ticket prices today and they are more expensive that from NY and the cheapest fares are from Manchester, NH. I did check Portland, ME and Boston, MA but Manchester was the least expensive at $495 on kayak.com. I usually check kayak.com and aircanada.com. It is the weekend and those who fly know that fares are cheaper during the week so hopefully they might go down during the week or you guys can find better deals that I did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I posted on the backpackers site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning a trip out west on Labor Day week which falls on on September 7th. The plan is to fly to Calgary, AB on September 5th. Rent a car in Calgary for the week and drive to Banff National Park which is about 3 hours away from Calgary. We'll fiy back on Saturday September 12th or Sunday September 13th. Therefore we only have to take 4 days off from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on backpacking Banff from Sunday September 6th until Friday September 11th. That's 6 days, 5 nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the trip:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$495 plane tickets to Calgary, AB &lt;br /&gt;$100 per person figuring we'll be at least 4 in a car big enough for our 4 backpacks &lt;br /&gt;$60 backcountry camping fees &lt;br /&gt;$100 for lodging at a hotel in Calgary on Saturday september 5th and Friday September 11th. (we'll need a nice shower at the end) &lt;br /&gt;$30 Gas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total cost = $785&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This total cost does not include equipment and food. That's up to you guys. We'll bring our own supplies. There are no porters on this trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll backpack an average of 12 miles a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need a serious commitment by no later than August 3rd. This means if you're coming you'll have to book your plane tickets by July11th. You'll have to purchase a plane ticket that arrives on Saturday September 5th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to book our tentsites ASAP so the earlier I get a commitment the better and also the closer we get to labor the higher tickets are going to be. I will take a maximum of 10 people with me. Before booking the flight get in touch with me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy your tickets as soon as you have talked to me and are sure you're coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to Banff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/ab/banff/index_E.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pc.gc.ca/p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://keralaarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/peyto-lake-banff-canada.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions please email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;francisco &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;metope@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Francisco</member_name><member_id>822470</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252364578000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246720255000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Banff National Park of Canada Backpacking Trip Labor Day Week</name><id>10801342</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252191600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/10801342/</event_url></item>
