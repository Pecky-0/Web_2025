This is usually potluck and I'll eventually post what we plan to have at the party. If you know what you'd like to bring please list in the comments here. More info to come...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. If you are only skeptical, then no new ideas make it through to you. You never learn anything new. You become a crotchety old person convinced that nonsense is ruling the world. (There is, of course, much data to support you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility and have not an ounce of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish useful ideas from the worthless ones. If all ideas have equal validity then you are lost, because then, it seems to me, no ideas have any validity at all."&lt;/p&gt;
