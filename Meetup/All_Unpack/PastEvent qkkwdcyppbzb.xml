&lt;p&gt;WELCOME: Are you interested in fun and simply, a healthier way of eating? Are you suffering from a health condition that may be food or lifestyle related? (85% of chronic diseases are)! The purpose of the Meetup: Cape Cod Raw is to gather and support people who want to transition into a healthier way of eating. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Wherever you are in this process, there are great ways to transition. Even if you are just attempting this for the first time, you will gain valuable information and support on food choices, on an acid/alkaline balance lifestyle, and on enjoying an abundant life that for many are our heart's desire. This Meetup group shares information related to raw food and holistic lifestyle.&amp;nbsp; We gather for demos, lectures and other related events that encourage a vegan and raw lifestyle. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Do some of us eat cooked food? Yes, of course we do. However, for optimal cellular health, we love eating raw, live food. We welcome the newbie, the curious and the seasoned raw foodist.&lt;/p&gt;
