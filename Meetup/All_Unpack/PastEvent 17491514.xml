Come see a film for free at this great location! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RSVP's are limited to 18 due to theater size, so please only say "Yes" if you're pretty sure you can make it. (There&amp;nbsp;should be&amp;nbsp;NO Maybe's&amp;nbsp;for this event.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are to attend, I will also need your FULL NAME for the Concierge to let you in to the building. So please, when you RSVP, either place it in your comment or contact me (AJ) by meetup e-mail or text message. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This event's film is: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#65279;The Social Network &lt;/strong&gt;(2010 - Drama/Biography, 2 Hours)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/"&gt;IMDB Description:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;A chronicle of the founding of Facebook, the social-networking Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staring: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and Justin Timberlake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the more popular and award contending films of last year.&amp;nbsp; I know I usually put a more liberal comment/description than that, but I haven't seen the film yet so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event start time is 6:45 for the social portion of the evening, so you can start showing up then.&amp;nbsp; But we will not start the film until 7:30 or shortly there after.&amp;nbsp; Don't plan to be any later than 7:30 though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Thanks to Susanne for offering to let us borrow her DVD of the film!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the waiting list.&amp;nbsp; As the date approaches I can add people on the waiting list if someone else backs out, provided you sent me your name for the concierge as a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Snacks:&lt;/span&gt; Bring your own Snacks and Beverages.&amp;nbsp; (Just Please be careful and responsible.)&amp;nbsp;Sharing is encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Getting in:&lt;/span&gt; Enter the building through the State Street Entrance (Between the intersections of State with Court and Chapel) and talk to the Concierge, there are&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;instructions near&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;the call box and a bell button on it if the door is locked.&amp;nbsp; If you really have trouble, pre-movie-start time you can call AJ at 315-345-9348.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Parking:&lt;/span&gt; There is metered street parking available near by on Orange Street and Court Street, pay until 7pm.&amp;nbsp; If you don't mind the longer walk, some of the Yale Lots are free in the evening/weekends. (I.E. Yale lot 51 on Temple Street.)&amp;nbsp; 360's Parking Garage is open to visitors for Credit Card Customers only at $5 daily max from 5pm on Friday through Sunday, the entrance is on State Street just to the Right of the building main entrance.&amp;nbsp; Other local near by businesses may have open parking, however you're on your own there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*** - As some of you may know, Meetup does charge the Leadership twice a year for hosting the website.  We &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;do not pass this fee along in any mandatory way&lt;/span&gt;, however we will be bringing a collection jar along to the next few functions and anything you can give towards defraying this cost to keeping the group going will be appreciated!  Thanks!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't think I really need to say this, but: This is basically an extension of my home I'm inviting you into, there for I expect everyone will treat it with respect and not risk future events (or my lease).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the building door, Ring the Bell Button, Concierge will Direct you.
