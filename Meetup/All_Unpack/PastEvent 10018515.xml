In case you want to go!&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;R&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;My name is Shin-Yi Yang, the director of the Boston Guzheng &lt;br /&gt;Ensemble. We will have a concert coming on April 11 at Babson &lt;br /&gt;College and I have the press release. Can you please help me to &lt;br /&gt;post it on your website?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Boston Guzheng Ensemble will have their annual concert on &lt;br /&gt;Saturday, April 11, 7:30 p.m. at Sorenson Theater, Sorenson &lt;br /&gt;Center of Art, Babson College, 231 Forest St., Wellesley, MA &lt;br /&gt;02457. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invented originally from China, the Guzheng is a plucked &lt;br /&gt;instrument that has 2,500 years of history. Today, it becomes &lt;br /&gt;one of the most popular Chinese instruments in China and the &lt;br /&gt;United States. In the concert, the ensemble will perform &lt;br /&gt;traditional, folk, and modern music from China.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BGE was founded by Shin-Yi Yang, the director of the &lt;br /&gt;ensemble, in 2002. The mission of the ensemble is to promote &lt;br /&gt;Chinese culture and music to the public and to bring to the &lt;br /&gt;audience a new sound and aural experience that are slightly &lt;br /&gt;different from the more typical individual performances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information visit www.BostonGuzheng.org. Admission is &lt;br /&gt;free.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if there have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Shin-Yi&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Not a Meetup- go on our own, bring your friends</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239666346000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237841736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>GuZheng Concert-free-in Wellesley Sat 4/11 7:30p fyi</name><id>10018515</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239492600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/10018515/</event_url></item>
