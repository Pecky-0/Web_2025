While I know many will be busy with other weekend plans, I couldn't resist posting these for Saturday afternoon. The Great Dictator  starts at 1pm and City Lights at 3:30. We will meet and discuss after  City Lights. I had hoped to post these for the evening, but The Brattle's on-line schedule has the evening screening of The Great Dictator starting too late for those of us who rely on the T. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great Dictator: &amp;quot;Charlie Chaplin's first talkie, made over a decade after the introduction of sound, stands as a brave and controversial piece of filmmaking. Entering production in 1937, at a time when many Americans saw Hitler as an ally rather than an enemy, the film was first released in 1940, prior to the United States' entry into the Second World War.&amp;quot;  BBC Films  &lt;br /&gt;and a complete review: &lt;a href="http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/greatdict.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.combustibl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;City Lights: subtitled &amp;quot;A Comedy Romance in Pantomime,&amp;quot; is generally viewed as Charlie Chaplin's greatest film - a &amp;quot;silent film&amp;quot; released three years after the start of the talkies era of sound. The melodramatic film, a combination of pathos, slapstick and comedy, was a tribute to the art of body language and pantomime - a lone hold-out against the assault of the talking film.
