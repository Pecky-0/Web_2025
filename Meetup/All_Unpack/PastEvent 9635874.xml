<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've finally been able to coordinate with Lisa and Elizabeth at The Good Dog Spot. We're scheduling our next meetup for Saturday, February 21 at 10am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to cover the cost of space rental, we'll need to charge $5/dog. I hope this will be feasible for people. If you aren't able to pay the $5, we would appreciate any amount you're able to contribute.  And, especially because we'll need enough people to cover cost of the rental, if you RSVP &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; please make every effort to attend! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing some familiar faces and hopefully making some new friends as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to email me with questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;Marianna&lt;br /&gt;(organizer)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238263125000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners and Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernMApugs</urlname><id>1207399</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233343462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Meet-Up!</name><id>9635874</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235228400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernMApugs/events/9635874/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/c/global_4651788.jpeg</photo_url></item>
