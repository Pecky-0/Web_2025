A yes list will be provided as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criteria:  All hikers must be able to maintain a minimum pace of two miles an hour for a minimum of two hours.  All hikers must have cold weather gear and be experienced above treeline in winter conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All attendees must read, understand and agree to the waiver/liability as outlined by this website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to trailhead. To reach the trailhead, follow the road that leaves NH 112 at a point 0.3 mi. east of its eastern junction with NH 116 and 1.9 mi. west of the WMNF Wildwood Campground. Turn left (south) at a junction 1.4 mi. from NH 112, then continue to the trailhead 3.0 mi. from NH 112.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;starting at Benton Trailhead &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 3.20 mi/3 hr 4 min/+2898 ft on the Benton Trail &lt;br /&gt; The trail descends slightly from the parking lot to an old logging road, follows the road along Tunnel Brook, then crosses the brook (may be difficult at high water) and bears right on an old logging road, crossing a newer logging road and then ascending the wooded spur that forms the south wall of Little Tunnel Ravine. Then there is a splendid view to the left into the ravine. The trail passes a spring (sign) on the right, then soon turns sharp right and climbs at moderate grades through a beautiful evergreen forest to the treeline, passing two outlooks. The Beaver Brook Trail (a part of the AT) enters from the left, just before the Benton Trail breaks out from the scrubby trees, and the two trails together ascend the bare north ridge, marked by cairns, to the summit. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Beaver Brook Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.40 mi/19 min/+224 ft on the Benton Trail &lt;br /&gt; It then descends to a col, climbs over another knob with several restricted outlooks, descends to a second col, and climbs to the junction with the Benton Trail just below the treeline. From this point, the two trails coincide, soon reaching the treeline and ascending the open, very exposed ridge crest to the summit. &lt;br /&gt; to Mt Moosilauke &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 3.60 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 3 hr 23 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +3163 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -41 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +3121 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 0.40 mi/19 min/-224 ft on the Benton Trail &lt;br /&gt; The Beaver Brook Trail begins at the summit of Mt. Moosilauke and coincides with the Benton Trail descending the open, very exposed ridge crest from the summit. The two trails enter into the trees and the Benton Trail diverges to the left. The Beaver Brook Trail descends to a col. and climbs over another knob with several restricted outlooks, and descends to another col. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Beaver Brook Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 3.20 mi/3 hr 4 min/-2898 ft on the Benton Trail &lt;br /&gt; The Benton Trail begins at the summit of Mt. Moosilauke together with the Beaver Brook Trail. The two trails descend the bare north ridge, marked by cairns, together. The trails break into the scrubby trees and the Beaver Brook Trail turns right; the Benton Trail continues straight, down the north ridge. It descends through a beautiful evergreen forest at moderate grades passing two outlooks.  The trail passes a spring (sign) on the left and continues its moderate descent. It passes a splendid view to the right into the Little Tunnel Ravine and then descends the wooded spur that forms the south wall of the ravine. It crosses a logging road then bears left onto an old logging road, crossing Tunnel Brook (may be difficult at high water). The road follows along Tunnel Brook and ascends slightly to enter the parking lot. &lt;br /&gt; to Benton Trailhead &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 7.20 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 6 hr 46 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +3204 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -3204 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change 0 ft &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dianne and I will be in a black four door Toyota Echo.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1286316599000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283189772000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MOOSILAUKEE VIA BENTON TRAIL</name><id>14592331</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286024400000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14592331/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/8/6/global_17449414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
