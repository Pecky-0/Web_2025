Bring swimming gear and we might be able to take a dip at Day Pond SP at the half-way point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salmon River State Forest is a 6,000 acre forest with several tributaries to the Salmon River and very good fishing. There are a couple indicated scenic views on the trail in the first .5 mile and 1.5 mile marks which we will cross again on the way back. Day Pond State Park has a trout stocked swimming pond as well as old 1700's foundations from the original sawmill and settlement. There are bathroom facilities at the start of the hike and at the halfway point at Day Pond SP. We'll be following the blue trail (Comstock Bridge Connector, Salmon River Trail North Loop, Salmon River South Loop, Comstock Bridge Connector). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area near the covered bridge at 3 PM sharp. There is no fee for parking. The hike is anticipated to take about 3.5 hours and should be done by about 6:30 PM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided (Day Pond has the best map for the hike. For parking, the Salmon River map is best.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring trailmix or some sort of hiking energy food as well as water for the hike. We might stop somewhere to eat after depending on how people feel about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salmon River State Forest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/forests/salmon.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best map for parking at trailhead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/maps/slmn.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day Pond State Park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/daypond.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best map for trail to be hiked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/maps/daypond.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETS:&lt;br /&gt;Pets on a leash are permitted in picnic areas and on hiking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/daypond.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/daypond.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157557634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kevin's Hike at Salmon River SF/Day Pond SP in Colchester CT</name><id>5115519</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1157914800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5115519/</event_url></item>
