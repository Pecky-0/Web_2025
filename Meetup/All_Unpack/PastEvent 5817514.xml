<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We have been having a great series of classes on meditation and discussing the writings of mystics from all the world religions. This week we will be hearing from a mystic in the Buddhist tradition. We begin the class with a guided meditation exercise. Then we read and discuss a selection from mystical literature. We have been finding that mystics from all religions seem to be saying much the same thing: God is inside of us, we can learn to have a relationship with God inside, and meditation is one of the major tools for developing this relationship, and the result of deepening in this relationship is peace that passes understanding. The words written by these remarkable people, often hundreds of years ago, are surprisingly fresh and relevant for us today. Come, if you would like to begin to experience this inner connection to God inside yourself. New members are always welcome. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
