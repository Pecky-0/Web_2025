One end of the&amp;nbsp;trail is at the Rt 181 trailhead, 4 miles south of the common on route 181. If anyone is interested in joining us, you can meet us at 11 at the common in the parking lot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 181 trailhead has a very small parking area so carpooling from the town common to the trailhead is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the link about this trail if you want to look it up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a description of the trail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Route 181 Trailhead &lt;br /&gt;

The Recreation Trail goes along a former railroad bed, portions of which are owned by the Belchertown Land Trust and theBelchertown Conservation Commission, and for most of its length and is very flat. It passes through some beautiful areas that are home to a wide variety of wildlife. The northern portion passes over the old Piper Farm property which is owned by the Town of Belchertown. It is approximately 4 miles long. This trail is possible through a partnership between the Belchertown Land Trust, the Mill Valley Snowmobile Club and the Town of Belchertown Conservation Commission. &lt;br /&gt;

Sounds good to me - thanks Linda for the suggestion. &lt;br /&gt;

If anyone is interested, you can email me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet Michelle at the Belchertown Common Parking Lot at 11am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michelle </member_name><member_id>34071322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333324695000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332894264000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Route 181 trailhead in Belchertown</name><id>58142702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333206000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/58142702/</event_url></item>
