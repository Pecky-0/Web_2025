<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For many of us, Atheism is a product of our prior conclusions about the materialistic nature of the world. However, there are many phenomena which are not obviously materialistic; the human mind is one of these, and indeed is quite often given as evidence of the existence of powers and energies which go beyond the material into the realm of the supernatural. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this meeting, we'll be looking at Andrew Melnyk's &amp;quot;A Case for Physicalism about the Human Mind&amp;quot; (2007), as a starting point for our discussion about the nature of mind. Is it materialistic? Supernatural? Are there more helpful terms we could be using? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article can be found at the Internet Infidels library, &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/andrew_melnyk/physicalism.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.infidels.o...&lt;/a&gt;. The Infidels archive also contains a critical response of Melnyk's presentation, at  &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/stewart_goetz/against-physicalism.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.infidels.o...&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Melnyk's counterresponse: &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/andrew_melnyk/first-person.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.infidels.o...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Friday before the meeting, I'll contact those who have RSVPd affirmatively, so we can coordinate a potluck dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235658853000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226864456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Secular Study Group: A Case for Physicalism about the Human Mind</name><id>9173749</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228690800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/9173749/</event_url></item>
