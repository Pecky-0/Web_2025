Many trails and options.  For this meet-up I am thinking of doing a 6 or so mile dirt trail - this is the main trail, and is more of a walk than a hike - that does a horseshoe from Great Woods Road to Pennybrook and back.  If we get a good pace going we can probably do it in less than 2 hours, but it usually takes longer than that because the dogs usually enjoy stopping by the water along the way.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256242252000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>trail seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NE-Trail-Dogs</urlname><id>1347727</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>New England Trail Dogs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253196525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute meet-up ; Lynn Woods Great Woods Road Entrance</name><id>11395955</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253368800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-Trail-Dogs/events/11395955/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/b/global_10753451.jpeg</photo_url></item>
