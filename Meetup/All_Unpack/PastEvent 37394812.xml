&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Doherty's East Ave. Irish Pub on East Ave. in Pawtucket!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Street turns into East Ave when crossing into Pawtucket, so its just over the border of the East Side. Doherty's is a homey local pub located just over the Providence line in Pawtucket and a FAVORITE location of many P-Collective members - you know who you are! Is it possible we haven't had an MNM here since last November?! Known for their HUGE selection of beer on tap, there's something for everyone. Monday night is Wing Nite, so be adventuresome and cross on over to Pawtucket, and let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
