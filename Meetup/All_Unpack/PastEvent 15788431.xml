So here we are. I hope many more of you can make it for some dinner and conversation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP by Wednesday Jan 5th so we can make reservations. If you want to come after that you'll have to call to see if there is room for you. And if you RSVP - please show up because you will be taking someone elses spot and screwing up our reservations. (thanks in advance for being good with this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about some of you newbees or ones who haven't come out in a while - why don't you get off the couch and join us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks and see you there !&lt;br /&gt;- R&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Meetup Group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294536719000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292935094000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Margarets - BYOB</name><id>15788431</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294358400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/15788431/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
