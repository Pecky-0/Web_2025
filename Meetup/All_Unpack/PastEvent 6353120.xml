So before the warm weather completely dissapears, lets meet at mine and Nele's place and grill up some brats - or steak, or feta, or veggie kebabs - whatever you would like.  We will provide the grill and the space.  We will also make some sort of salad, provide some bread, and buy a couple of 6 packs of beer.  We will leave the rest up to you guys!  Please let us know you will be bringing so that we can plan accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Taylor</member_name><member_id>1999104</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191036267000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189711264000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>One Last Go At The Grill!!</name><id>6353120</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190498400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/6353120/</event_url></item>
