<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This event will focus on &lt;strong&gt;strategy&lt;/strong&gt; games.  Unlike word games which focus on your language skills, card games which focus on your ability to create patterns and sets and party games which test your general knowledge and creativity, strategy games involve executive level functions.  For example, some games involve money management, others involve timing and planning ahead, some involve designing military planning etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of strategy games people in this group have been known to enjoy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 Wonders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutthroat Caverns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dominion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medici&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you like any of these games or want to learn more about this genre, this event will be for you.  We welcome new players with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will leave it up to group choice on what we play that night so please bring your favorites. We generally divide into smaller groups depending on group size and game preferences. We also encourage people to bring any new games they got for the holidays and want to try out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know that we are a household with a cat, but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to two small children, who will both hopefully be in bed by the event start time, but either child may make a brief appearance at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking may be available on Upham Street, but it is generally tight, and there will be street construction going on this month. There is parking available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
