Participate in a FREE NEBBC-sanctioned training class, Q&amp;amp;A with the NEBBC-endorsed trainers, take home a FREE homemade doggie treat bag (while supplies last!), and have you and your dog's picture taken for the launch of our new and improved official website! We will take this opportunity to collect items for the Providence Animal Rescue League (inundated with pit bulls). Just bring your items to the event: linens, food, leashes, collars, toys, etc. FREE practice CGC-run-throughs and pit bull training demonstrations with the NEBBC Soldie Dogs, as well! NEBBC donations, as always, are accepted! We hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318341168000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316992592000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE NEBBC Member Appreciation Event!</name><id>34927762</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318087800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/34927762/</event_url></item>
