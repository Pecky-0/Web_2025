Since we had so much fun last year watching the Superbowl together we decided to make this a annual tradition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday February 7th we will have the Ex-Midwest 2nd Annual Superbowl Party this time traditional superbowl games and trivia will be added to make things a little more interesting.  The location and exact time will be updated but expect it to begin between 5-5:30 P.M..  As far as the location it will be either one of two places, The Fours right by North Station or The Tavern right down the street from Central Redline T Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for more information!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve rosen</member_name><member_id>3640517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265753515000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263741519000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd Annual Ex-Midwest Superbowl Party</name><id>12342531</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265580000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/12342531/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/global_4872018.jpeg</photo_url></item>
