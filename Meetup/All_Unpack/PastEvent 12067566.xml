Thank you all.  It was close, but in the end there was a clear winner:  The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Milan Kundera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've seen the movie, you know that this is the story of Daniel Day-Lewis, and some women, and there's people protesting something, and there might be a war involved, and at one point you think the movie is going to end, and then it KEEPS GOING.  I've actually seen the movie twice, so I'm psyched to finally read the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An actual synopsis, per Amazon, is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A young woman is in love with a successful surgeon, a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing. His mistress, a free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayalsâ€”while her other lover, earnest, faithful, and good, stands to lose everything because of his noble qualities. In a world where lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and fortuitous events, and everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel &amp;quot;the unbearable lightness of being.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major achievement from one of the world's truly great writers, Milan Kundera's magnificent novel of passion and politics, infidelity and ideas, encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, illuminating all aspects of human existence.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location is My Thai Vegan Cafe.  I ate there for lunch this past week and, as a meat lover, was impressed by how good their fake meat was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264358780000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260569544000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston readers:  The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Milan Kundera</name><id>12067566</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263339000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/12067566/</event_url></item>
