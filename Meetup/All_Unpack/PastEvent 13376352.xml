If enough people are going, we can plan on meeting at a central location and heading out from there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: NEW TIME&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to a 60% chance of showers predicted for the later part of the afternoon, I have pushed up the start time for this event.  However, the actual festival runs 11 AM to 11 PM, so feel free to go as early or late as you like.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276543739000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272940976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock'N Ribfest!</name><id>13376352</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276365600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/13376352/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/6/a/global_8860714.jpeg</photo_url></item>
