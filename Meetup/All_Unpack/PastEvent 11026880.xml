The first week we will be focusing on mindful breathing and posture, which are two fundamental aspects of mindful mediation. We will learn that mindfulness is not so much about cultivating inner peace as it is about increasing non-judgmental awareness and clarity of thought and sensory experience. We may have more peace in our lives as a result, but it is not the primary focus of our efforts. With so much distraction and stimulation in the world, it helps to have a regular practice that brings us back to the moment and increases our awareness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course will be supported by audio instruction provided by Gil Fronsdal, primary teacher for the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Each week for the next six weeks, we will start the group by listening to his talk, which lasts about one hour, and will follow with discussion about the content and our experiences. This will be a good refresher course for those who have been meditating for years, as well as those who are new to mindfulness or meditation. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253569861000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249340742000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mindfulness Meditation Course - Week 1</name><id>11026880</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252965600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/11026880/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
