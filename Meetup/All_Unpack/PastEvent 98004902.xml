This will be pot luck style as usual. For those attending, it will be helpful if you can list your food, drinks, and/or snacks that you can contribute under this Meetup event page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science swap has been really fun in past years, so we’re doing it again! Be creative, have fun, and no need to go shopping for this. Bring some kind of wrapped up science, reason, or skeptic themed item from your home. Some ideas: book, video, uniquely themed item, etc. If you feel inclined to purchase something, keep it around $15. This was a blast last year. Can’t wait to see all the interesting items. We will probably swap around 8pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll play some rounds of quick party games. Hmm... and maybe some prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past years' parties have been fun and we're looking forward to bringing our friends back together for another great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: We are at a new address this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darrick Fauvel</member_name><member_id>2719698</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lindsay</member_name><member_id>14101079</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358119595000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357361507000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Season of Reason Party: 2013 (Limited only to remaining survivors of 2012)</name><id>98004902</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358024400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/98004902/</event_url></item>
