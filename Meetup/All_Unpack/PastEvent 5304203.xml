<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>hello,  &lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for that email that went out about meeting on Sunday, it is an automatic email from the old organizer that I have not been able to fully delete. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really like to meet the last Wed of every month at 7:30pm. This will help us be more regular with meeting and people can look forward to it.  I am also open to meeting other times and special events. So I would like to invite you to our first regular meet up this month on the 27th of December.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic/mediation will be on attaining peace and stillness inside and outside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there... &lt;br /&gt;In light,  &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540779000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1165126219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation Meet up Dec 27th ( Last Wed of every month)</name><id>5304203</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1167264000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/5304203/</event_url></item>
