I chose to do this event on Sunday in an effort to avoid travelers who are going to the island for the weekend. &lt;br /&gt;Ferry Tickets &lt;br /&gt;Members are responsible for purchasing their own ferry tickets: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blockislan..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.blockislan...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, it is a holiday weekend, so I advise purchasing sooner than later. Please make sure you purchase a ticket for the traditional (not hi-speed) ferry.&lt;br /&gt;The ferry ride is one-hour. Tickets are $18.95 round-trip. Bicycles are $6.10 round-trip.&lt;br /&gt;Arrival Time: &lt;br /&gt;Try to arrive by 8:00 am so you'll have enough time to park and board the ferry. &lt;br /&gt;Parking &lt;br /&gt;Located down the street from the ferry, and ranges from $5 - $20.&lt;br /&gt;What to bring &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· Bike &amp;amp; Lock (if you'd like to ride); or you can rent one on the island for $25(reservation is suggested) &lt;br /&gt;· Water &lt;br /&gt;· Sun Screen &lt;br /&gt;· Breakfast for ferry ride &lt;br /&gt;· Bathing Suit &lt;br /&gt;· Beach Towel &lt;br /&gt;· Snacks &lt;br /&gt;· Cash for Lunch (or we may do a picnic lunch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is weather permitting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Germaine</member_name><member_id>10481143</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275439295000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274664401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Block Island</name><id>13573289</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275220800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/13573289/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/6/global_5571958.jpeg</photo_url></item>
