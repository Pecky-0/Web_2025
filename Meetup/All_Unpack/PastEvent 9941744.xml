This will be a fun easy going get together. No pressure to speak completely in Portuguese. You can get comfortable by just listening then jump in when you're ready to talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;RSVP EARLY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; because seating is limited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see how this new location works for us. Algiers is a quiet, cozy, funky place with a variety of tasty dishes for carnivores as well as vegetarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to eat or just drink, while we chat. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.harvardsquare.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=45165708-59fa-48c1-83f4-69d3da6d0887" target="_blank"&gt;Algiers Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;There will &lt;span style="color: brown"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; be a group bill. Please maintain your own tab or pay as you go since people will be arriving and leaving at various times.&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime ago in separate conversations Ramzi and Alvaro suggested we have simple lessons during our Portuguese Table. I thought we could play a game which can also serve as an ice breaker. Each person has five cards and the object of the game is to be the person with the most cards after five statements have been made, in Portuguese of course. The statement is &amp;quot;I have never....&amp;quot; and then you complete the sentence. For example, &amp;quot;I have never learned how to fly a plane.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nunca aprendi como voar um avi√£o.&amp;quot; Then those who know how to fly a plane would put a card in the middle of the table. Then the next person will say &amp;quot;I have never....&amp;quot; and so on and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're not required to take part, you're welcome to have individual conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MBTA:&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to plan your public transportation route.
