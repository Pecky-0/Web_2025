A sharing of the heart, hands-on stretching of the body with a focus on the breath and open communication. Couples welcome but not required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sacred Tantric Practice, in its purest form, describes both the process and methodologies for the resolution of all conflicts of opposites. From earliest times, the symbology used has been based on the interpenetration of what is, metaphorically, referred to as male - female. In modern terms, it is the search for non-duality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word Tantra stems from Sanskrit roots which literally translates as web or warp (as in weaving) - within each individual - the conscious-unconscious, male-female, in breath - outbreath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Imani and John Zito in exploring this fascinating topic and practice at the Growing Green Wellness Center. The cost is $5 per person. Green Vibration members may count this as one of four free fitness classes per month according to their membership benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about becoming a member, please visit: &lt;a href="http://www.growinggreenevents.com/join-our-community.php" target="_blank"&gt;www.GrowingGreenEvents.com/Join-our-Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Imani</member_name><member_id>7960334</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263936935000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260729712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tantra Yoga, the Power of Ritual</name><id>12076310</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263763800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/12076310/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/global_12216004.jpeg</photo_url></item>
