&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey all! Looks like more people are interested in the Euro/Strategy games these days...yay! It's been awhile since Robert and I have hosted, our schedule&amp;nbsp;can be rather uncertain. Having lots of kids and a husband who works retail can do that - arg!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually do not have alot of the new Euro games so if you have something particular in mind, you might want to bring your copy. We have Ra which some of you have been turned onto lately and Dominian, un-opened (because everyone else seems to have a copy) and no expansions. I'll be purchasing 7 Wonders (thanks Ryan!) which is my new fav - we have other stuff like Medici, Carcasonne, Puerto Rico and Settlers of Catan (which we haven't played in awhile) plus expansions. Maybe more, haven't looked in the game closet in awhile. We should be able to accomadate two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I'll have some food available here, whatever I'm inspired to make that day. Bring your favorite snack or drink! Please email at LeticiaSedai@aol.com or call me at 978-744-7644 for any questions.&amp;nbsp; There is parking available on our street and surrounding streets but&amp;nbsp;if things are tight, you can park in the Senior Center lot at the top of Winthrop or anywhere off Broad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hope this works out, I'll be confirming the&amp;nbsp;venue the&amp;nbsp;morning of! Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leticia</member_name><member_id>10156175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327810540000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326725165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Strategy Game Night in Salem</name><id>48292612</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327710600000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/48292612/</event_url></item>
