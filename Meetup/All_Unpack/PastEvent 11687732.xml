The Hebrew teacher in the movie was my Hebrew teacher.  I visited my mother last month and the entire population of her senior living home went to see the movie - it was about them and their lives as adults and parents of future movie moguls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to see it on Saturday at 4:00 at Kendall - if you haven't had a chance to see it yet and you're free, perhaps you'll join.  If people wish, after we can go to any of the restaurants nearby to discuss the movie: Did we grow up during the 70's?  Did our parents grow up then?  How were we influenced by that time period?  Do the Coen Brothers reflect, distort, tease reality?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I'm only giving two days' notice, I'm not allowing maybe's.  Only answer yes if you really plan on attending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the synopsis from the IMDB website.  IT CONTAINS SPOILERS so don't read if you want to be surprised by the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Serious Man is the story of an ordinary mans search for clarity in a universe where Jefferson Airplane is on the radio and F-Troop is on TV. It is 1967, and Larry Gopnik (Tony Award nominee Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor at a quiet Midwestern university, has just been informed by his wife Judith (Sari Lennick) that she is leaving him. She has fallen in love with one of his more pompous acquaintances, Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), who seems to her a more substantial person than the feckless Larry. Larrys unemployable brother Arthur (Richard Kind) is sleeping on the couch, his son Danny (Aaron Wolff) is a discipline problem and a shirker at Hebrew school, and his daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) is filching money from his wallet in order to save up for a nose job.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;While his wife and Sy Ableman blithely make new domestic arrangements, and his brother becomes more and more of a burden, an anonymous hostile letter-writer is trying to sabotage Larrys chances for tenure at the university. Also, a graduate student seems to be trying to bribe him for a passing grade while at the same time threatening to sue him for defamation. Plus, the beautiful woman next door torments him by sunbathing nude. Struggling for equilibrium, Larry seeks advice from three different rabbis. Can anyone help him cope with his afflictions and become a righteous person -- a mensch -- a serious man?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the center of the movie theater - seated before and during the movie.  I'll be wearing a blue sweater or shirt.  After, I'll stand in the front right corner of the theater to meet and greet.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256236546000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Serious Man  - Once Again</name><id>11687732</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256414400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/11687732/</event_url></item>
