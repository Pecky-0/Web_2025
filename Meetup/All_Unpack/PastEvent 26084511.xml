Reilly plays the high school principal in 
&lt;em&gt;Terri&lt;/em&gt;, a story about an overweight teen trying to get through his high school years wearing a different set of pajamas each day of the week. Reilly is a favorite of mine. He was in 
&lt;em&gt;Cyrus&lt;/em&gt;, a bittersweet and offbeat film I thought was fantastic, so I am looking forward to seeing him again in another small-budget film. (And in yet another movie named after another character--wonder if that's a trend!) I have a feeling that Reilly and 
&lt;em&gt;Terri&lt;/em&gt; will live up to my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about 
&lt;em&gt;Terri&lt;/em&gt; at the theater website: 
&lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheaters.com/"&gt;http://www.landmarktheaters.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on the link for "Boston" on the left,&amp;nbsp;then scroll down on the right to find the movie, you will also find&amp;nbsp;links for the trailer, an interview with the director,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;a review from the Boston 
&lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will purchase my ticket at 6:15 and then wait by the foot of the stairs in the theater lobby. Look for me and my&amp;nbsp;trusty red backpack.&amp;nbsp;At 6:30, I will head into the theater auditorium to catch the previews. The movie starts at 6:45 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you arrive late, look for me in the theater lobby after the movie. I'll wait there to gather everyone and see if people would like to go out for tea and/or a bite to eat at The Friendly Toast ( 
&lt;a href="http://www.thefriendlytoast.net/"&gt;http://www.thefriendlytoast.net&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP if you plan to attend this event. My events tend to be small, and it's disconcerting when someone shows up unannounced, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the Kendall!&lt;/p&gt;
