&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;span style="color : #FF0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ninth Anniversary Meeting!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Please bring food - munchies, main dishes, desserts, drinks, cups, plates or ice! We will use the first hour of the meeting to celebrate the seventh anniversary. We will eat in the lounge area outside Room 315. Use the time to network, pick the brains of your fellow traders and introduce yourself to some of the members you haven't yet met. Please fill out a name tag and wear it. For the "serious" part of the meeting, we will have an interactive Market discussion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a friend you talk stocks with, bring them with you! Food or drinks are not allowed in any MIT meeting room. We strongly urge each person to make his or her own decisions about investing their money. Investment ideas and recommendations made during our meetings and in our online dialogs bear no liability by anyone. This is a free and open meeting. No membership is required, but please RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Free parking is available on the Amherst St side of the building or in the Hayward St. lot a block away.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff Orrik</member_name><member_id>1135788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345749903000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Investor$ who think 4 themselve$</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonIBD</urlname><id>81154</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Investor's Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345145491000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ninth Anniversary Boston Investor's Group Meeting</name><id>78045992</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345676400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/events/78045992/</event_url></item>
