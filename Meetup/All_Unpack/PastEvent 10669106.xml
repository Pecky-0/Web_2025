Depending on the size of the group and speed of walkers, we can have a couple of small (or big) groups so everyone can buddy up. Hopefully the weather will work out and we'll have a great night! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this event, please contact me (Julie). THANKS! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Wollaston Beach: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wollaston Beach can be accessed from many points. The best way to get to our meeting place is to get off 93N at Exit 8 (Furnace Brook Parkway), exit ramp rotary following small green sign for Furnace Brook Parkway, and follow Furnace Brook Parkway for 2.9 miles.
