Robert Luhn posted this on the Boston Atheist mailing list:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;On January 23, after the 7pm screening, the theater will host a Q&amp;amp;A panel with two world-class scholars: Dr. Kenneth Miller and Dr. Karl Giberson. Miller, a biology professor at Brown University, is author of one of the most widely used high school biology textbooks in the U.S. and author of &amp;quot;Only a Theory: Evolution and the Battle for America's Soul&amp;quot;. Dr. Giberson, a noted science and religion scholar, and president of the BioLogos Foundation, is the author of many books on science and faith, including &amp;quot;Saving Darwin: How to Be a Christian and Believe in Evolution&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet in the theater around 6:30-6:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If between our members and those of the Boston Atheists, we can get 25 people to attend, we'll be able to secure tickets at a discount, $7.25 each. So please, RSVP if you can join the outing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is about Charles Darwin, his family, and &amp;quot;On the Origin of Species&amp;quot;. It's based on Randal Keynes's book &amp;quot;Annie's Box&amp;quot;. Randal is Darwin's great-great-grandson. Eugenie Scott of the NCSE wrote a review encouraging people to do what the supporters of &amp;quot;Expelled&amp;quot; did: &amp;quot;get lots of people to show up on opening weekend to give the movie a big ratings boost.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/eugenie-scott-r.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://pandasthumb.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a showing at 7 pm Saturday night, but we are going for the group rate on Friday.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There's an area set back on the left after the concession stand but before the ticket takers.
