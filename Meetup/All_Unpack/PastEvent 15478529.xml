Based around Jenga, Dread's rules and system lend themselves naturally toward a tension-filled game.  Every time your character wants to attempt something that isn't clearly impossible or ridiculously easy, you'll have to make a &amp;quot;pull,&amp;quot; moving a block from the Jenga tower and placing it on top.  And let's just say that if the tower falls during or just after your move, it won't turn out so good for your character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dread is extremely character and narrative based -- there aren't ANY number values for character stats, so if that's not your thing, this might be one one-shot you sit out.  That said, this is a horror game and so we hope you feel at least a little uncomfortable with the proceedings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like your horror games dripping with tension, uneasy laughter, and maybe a few bumps in the night, sign on up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the December installment of our series of one-shot indie RPG experiences to be offered monthly over the course of 2010.  Each month will feature a different GM running a new game.  This month's GM is Liane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a game on your shelf that you've been itching to run, but your regular group just isn't interested?  Why not run it for us at the Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston!  We want to continue running one-shot games into 2011, and you can help!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the table with the towering Jenga tower. . . .of dread power.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tewhill</member_name><member_id>3431516</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1292089262000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290017838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December One-Shot - Dread: The Impossible Dream</name><id>15478529</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291482000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/15478529/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
