This is the first book published of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in the English-speaking world. The book is based on lectures given by him in 1979 and 1981 in the US and in Canada in 1980. It is widely considered to be the most readable, yet substantive and wide-ranging, of his works. The teachings comprehend and encapsulate in a crisp and concise manner all of the topics to which the Dalai Lama returns repeatedly--relating to the core subject matter of Tibetan Buddhism. This is an excellent introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, and the teachings of the Dalai Lama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Though [the Dalai Lama] is one of the most erudite of scholars...he has a gift for reducing his doctrine to a core of lucid practicality, crystallized in the title of his book, &amp;quot;Kindness, Clarity and Insight.&amp;quot; Time Magazine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The revised and updated edition of this book (2006) is available from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble online for $19.95 (www.barnesandnoble.com).  Used copies of the original edition may also be available in paperback and hardcopy.
