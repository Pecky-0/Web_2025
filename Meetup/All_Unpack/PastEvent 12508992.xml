Come see the exact same movie -- &lt;i&gt;in space&lt;/i&gt;! -- but with a guy who can emote better than Kevin Costner did. Watch the director James Cameron caress the computer-generated jungle with the camera again and again and again, just as he did with his computer-generated ship in &amp;quot;Titanic&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these two points, it is a really fun movie that I really want to see again. Sure you can guess what happens -- James Cameron is working with grand archetypes here! -- but it still doesn't doesn't spoil the enjoyment of watching Sam Worthington as the Marine Jake Sully who is slowly questioning which side is the true enemy... the Na'vi, or his own.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the best computer game I have ever sat and watched on the big screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Care to grab something to eat before? Starting at 5:30 pm, T.J. Maher will be hanging out at the City Place food court in the Massachusetts State Transportation Building in the Theater District at 8 Park Plaza in front of D'Angleos. &lt;a href="http://www.wilderco.com/city-place2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wilderco.c...&lt;/a&gt; . Feel free to drop buy before the movie! T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP table tent on a few tables he is sitting at. As more people come, we can comandeer tables and push them together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie theater is right across from the Boylston T stop on the Green Line, near the corner of Tremont and Boylston. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
