The cemetery was first developed in 1851. Over the years the city made several additional land purchases, until the cemetery grew to around 275 acres. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of Manchester's most prominent citizens were buried at Pine Grove. These include philanthropist Frank P. Carpenter, industrialist George A. Leighton and 13 Manchester mayors. Also buried there are some now forgotten people whose compelling stories will be retold. The cemetery includes beautiful monuments of many different designs, the Ursula Chapel built in 1905, the City Mausoleum built in 1980, and 17 family mausoleums.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Manchester Historic Association</member_name><member_id>10139829</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276525831000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>History fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-History-Network</urlname><id>1505455</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester History Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268695041000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pine Grove Cemetery Walking Tour - Part 1</name><id>12885254</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276450200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-History-Network/events/12885254/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/f/f/global_15353887.jpeg</photo_url></item>
