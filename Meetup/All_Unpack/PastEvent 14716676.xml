<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;I will not make this ride due to life getting in the way, but will keep this ride up for those that would like to meet the Boston Group directly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meetup Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleepy's&lt;br /&gt;8 Allstate Road&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA  02125&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup at Sleepy's is at 10:am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is the route that we are gonna take:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openroadjourney.com/loadroute.asp?rid=1190" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.openroadjo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only change is that instead of starting the route at Middleborough MA, we'll start at Hingham MA, take route 3A all the way down to Plymouth MA. The Route 3A map is here: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.motorcycleroads.us/roads/ma3a.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.motorcycle...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing road, full of twisties and sharp turns. From Plymouth, we'll follow the route as per the first map above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can plan to have lunch somewhere in Plymouth. I know couple of nice restaurants there and I believe Nikole has few ideas as well. We can explore the town, get something to eat and start riding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Plymouth all the way upto East Falmouth, we would be riding along the coast. Then from there to Bourne, it is also a coastal road. We then end the ride at Middleborough MA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total ride is gonna be about 200miles, from Hingham to Middleborough. We should plan for at least 7hrs on that day.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Navy CFL</member_name><member_id>8858593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284817626000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>West-Conn Sport Bike Riders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>west-connsportbikeriders</urlname><id>1535765</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>West-Conn Sport Bike Riders</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284073237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cape Cod Joint Ride w/Boston Sport Bikes </name><id>14716676</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284813000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/west-connsportbikeriders/events/14716676/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/5/global_17831157.jpeg</photo_url></item>
