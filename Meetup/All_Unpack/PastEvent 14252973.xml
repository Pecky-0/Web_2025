I'll send my contact info a few to everyone who RSVPs Yes or Maybe a few days prior to the meetup.   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>my number is 617-257-4878</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eli</member_name><member_id>1192790</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281274071000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280420847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pizzeria Crawl</name><id>14252973</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281196800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/14252973/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/d/global_6535197.jpeg</photo_url></item>
