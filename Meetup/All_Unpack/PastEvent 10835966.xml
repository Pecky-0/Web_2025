Wool was in very short supply, as were so many other things, and the booklet encouraged women to unpick old, unwearable, woolen items in order to re-use the wool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knitting patterns were issued so that people could make items for the Army and Navy to wear in winter, such as balaclavas and gloves. This not only produced the much-needed items, but also gave those on the &amp;quot;home front&amp;quot; a positive sense of contributing to the war effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263673940000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247107786000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seacoast Knitters Unite  -Wednesday Jan 13th</name><id>10835966</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263425400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835966/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/d/global_9564861.jpeg</photo_url></item>
