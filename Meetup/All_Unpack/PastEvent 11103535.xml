The years that followed their move to the White House were filled with personal and national crises. The Lincolns will tell stories of their early lives and the challenges they faced during this turbulent time in our country's history. This program will be presented by living history performers Sharon and Steve Wood. Note: The program will begin after a short business meeting of the members of the Manchester Historic Association. Pre-registration is requested. This program is generously sponsored by the New Hampshire Humanities Council.
