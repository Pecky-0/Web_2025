Let's get together and share ideas for dealing with today's "mold-breaking" family challenges. These could include: blended families with step-children, adopted children, multiple races, heritages or religions; single parents or families with a spouse that travels a lot or is deployed; families of same-sex partners; families that live far from relatives; families with members who have special needs. How do you establish traditions that strengthen the uniqueness of your family? Every unique family has challenges to overcome in today's mainstream society, too numerous to list here. Join us as we support each other by sharing ideas that have worked for our families and brainstorming new ideas to strengthen all family structures. Hopefully you'll realize that you are not alone and will make lasting connections with other similar families.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gwyneth Landry</member_name><member_id>38720692</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369880830000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365444943000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discussion:Supporting the Non-Traditional Families in a Traditional World</name><id>113319832</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369869300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/113319832/</event_url></item>
