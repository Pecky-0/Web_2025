Go for dinner, then fly back.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise will get the loaner car squared away from LCI to the docks. Gary has said he has room for us in his 24 footer.  He knows where to go to eat. Best of all, we get to crash (oops, bad choice of words) his vacation plans....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, whaddaya say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we'll be back before 9:30 ish. Summers are short. These flights have been great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP ASAP &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245813799000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215889690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Laconia Dinner.
