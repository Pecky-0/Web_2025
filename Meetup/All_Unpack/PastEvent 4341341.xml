This is our second time at the Trident Cafe on Newbury Street, and folks seem to like the location and the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's keep the momentum going! Once we get enough regular attendees, we can have the back room all to ourselves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month, in addition to your business cards, make sure to bring three things that you're looking for--whether professionally or personally. We're going to do a networking exercise aimed at making one-off connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tridentboo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Graphic Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>graphicdesign-39</urlname><id>71144</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Graphic Design Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1109813800000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Graphic Design April Meetup</name><id>4341341</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1112830200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/graphicdesign-39/events/4341341/</event_url></item>
