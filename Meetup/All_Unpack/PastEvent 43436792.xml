It's a great way to meet other members and socialize. Good people and good conversation for a Tuesday night! We only can do a maximum of 8 people since most Starbucks are small for seating a big group. This has been a big hit with everyone in the past so we are going to do this event on a weekly basis from here on out. We may also change Starbucks locations on a weekly basis. Hope to see you all there! Until then have fun and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323993617000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323098816000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Starbucks Farmington</name><id>43436792</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323824400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/43436792/</event_url></item>
