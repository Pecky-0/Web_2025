I'll be there from &lt;b&gt;7:30 - 9:00pm&lt;/b&gt; for drinks and some pub grub so please &lt;b&gt;pop in to say hello whenever you can&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil is a 12-piece percussion ensemble that ROCKED the house with the happiest and most impressive high-energy beats I've heard since a Rusted Root concert over a decade ago.  They're playing nearby at 9pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all those who want to meet me for drinks/apps/meals, please do.  At 9pm I will head down the street to Johnny D's to meetup with Tonya &amp;amp; company at the concert/dance party so all those who want to follow me, please do.  If you only want to chit-chat and then head home, no worries.  Either way, see ya soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tiny place so it will be easy.
