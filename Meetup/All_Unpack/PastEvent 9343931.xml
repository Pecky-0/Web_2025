In the words of the New Haven Register's food critic: &amp;quot;Kumo is tasty. Kumo is attractive. And this fall, Kumo is a stone cold bargain.  Does that mean I think you should run out right now and order up a boatload of sushi at Kumo?  Why yes, yes it does.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will put out tasty treats for us and have drink specials too.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact is: Ed (203) 583-9668&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230598891000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229384680000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour - Kumo New Haven</name><id>9343931</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229986800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9343931/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/0/global_6647536.jpeg</photo_url></item>
