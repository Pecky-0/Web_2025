Written by David S. Brody, a resident of Westford MA, you'll go on a thrill ride through history and local sites (many of which you might recognize) to discover the secret of the Cabal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're meeting a little earlier in the month this time because of the Thanksgiving Holiday, but don't worry if you don't finish the book. Show up anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also meeting in Nashua this time, which we haven't done yet. The place is called Fody's Great American Tavern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usual 12 person cap applies as always. However, I will make the RSVP Date a little later so that people can join if other folks cancel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you in Nov!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. We've also chosen our December book as well. It will be a classic.....with a twist. That's right! We're reading Pride and Prejudice....and Zombies!! Details for the Dec meeting will come out after we meet in Nov.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1258762094000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256860423000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn the secret of the Knight!</name><id>11745577</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258588800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/11745577/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
