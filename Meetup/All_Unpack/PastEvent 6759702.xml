Third meeting! More members show up every time = good sign!! Back at my house this time, the Idle Dog, 15 Glendale Street, Maynard, MA 01754. 978-973-7855. Deb Muise. 1pm till whenever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time we will discuss combining winter meetings with the Sudbury Small Breed Dogs Meetup usually held at Best Friends on the third Wednesday of every month. We'll need a new name: (The Universal Small Dog Meetup Group?, the Milky Way Small Dog meetup group?? Tiny Paws? Petite Paws?? I'm getting carried away here...). $1 requested fee this time to cover $20/month membership fee and goodies expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obvious holiday theme, of course. Dress your dog in any appropriate outfit, if you can. I will take a million pictures this time. I'll also have various holiday treats for humans and dogs. All welcome.  Guests with 4 feet must be under 40 lbs. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb Muise</member_name><member_id>3834061</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197915141000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Small Dog Breed Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-136</urlname><id>727218</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195326304000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs December Meetup</name><id>6759702</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197741600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-136/events/6759702/</event_url></item>
