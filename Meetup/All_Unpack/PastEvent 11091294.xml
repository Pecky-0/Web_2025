Looks like it will be warm so I would like to get an early start.  Pawtuckaway will have nice shade, and a pond to swim in after!  If you don't know the way in to Round Pond try to meet me at the power lines on Reservation Rd in Deerfield, NH at 9am or so,  then you can follow me into the pond/climbing area.  If you know how to get in find the group around the lower/upper slab area if we're not at Lakeside Jam. (The cliff right at round pond parking) &lt;br /&gt;All level/age climbers welcome!!  Please let me know if you will need gear so I can bring it for you and If you could let me know by Fri morning as I may be camping at the Pawtuckaway campground on Fri night.  &lt;br /&gt;Hope to see a good group Sat :)&lt;br /&gt;Kellie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have the large green van.  The climbing in NOT located near the big Pawtuckaway Lake and Camping, it's on the other side of the park, so be sure you know where to go before you leave.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251318818000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250041715000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Morning Pawtuckaway climb</name><id>11091294</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250341200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/11091294/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/global_8592199.jpeg</photo_url></item>
