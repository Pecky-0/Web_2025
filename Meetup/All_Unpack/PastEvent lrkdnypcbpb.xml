<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;br /&gt;January's meeting will feature Angel Flight.  Dick Sundell, Flight Operations and Community events will be our speaker. &lt;br /&gt;He will inform us how to become an Angel Flight pilot or crew member. Answer some obvious questions. What to expect? Do you need to be a pilot? Do I have to accept all flights? How often, how much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the FPA members have asked about signing up. I'm looking forward to this. Ed Murphy was an Angel Flight pilot and has some great stories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.angelflightne.org&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, OSH Raffle Tickets will be on sale....
