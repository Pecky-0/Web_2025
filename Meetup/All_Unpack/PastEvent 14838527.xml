McCray's Monster Mash Haunted Hay Ride is very well put together and quite scary (boo) lol.  Come by yourself or with someone that you can grab onto ;) McCray's Farm is situated in a rural area of So. Hadley and is picturesque and scenic.  You can pick pumpkins, buy old fashion ice cream, or sip on hot apple cider while you wait in line for the ride.  Tickets for this event is $15 per person and we will purchase tickets as a group just before going on ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is enough of a demand we can go for pizza and beer after at Pizza Palace on rte 116 in So. Hadley.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287878942000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285025824000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>McCray's Haunted Hay Ride</name><id>14838527</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287874800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/14838527/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
