Bring rain poncho or rain jacket, rain pants optional**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start out In the Giuffrida Park parking lot at no later than 9 AM sharp and hike past the dam for Crescent Lake. This part may be a little wet as we have to cross below the dam where the trail crosses the spillway. Then we hike up the steep side of the ridge and climb only about an easy 10 feet or so of traprock. The path to climb is very easy with lots of secure places for feet and hands and can barely be called climbing. The reward is great though as at the top on Chauncey Peak is a WONDERFUL vista!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail follows the cliff edge to the north with a great view of the lake below and Lamintation Mtn. on the other side of the lake. Eventually, as we get past the lake, the trail will cut down steeply from the ridge line. There is no climbing, but you need to watch your step lest you slip on leaves or scree and slide a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then travel a little up the side of Lamintation Mtn. before cutting back to the lake. The path continues down by the side of the lake and finishes with a pleasent walk through the old evergreens at lakeside to get back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll roughly estimate this hike to be a beautiful 2 hrs. and be done by 11 AM. We'll stop for lunch after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go need to have: &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - You need your hands free. To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food and water. &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks - To keep those feet warm even if wet. &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing - Avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too. &lt;br /&gt;* Gloves - MUST have &amp;amp; warm ones too! &lt;br /&gt;* Jacket - BRIGHT color best given hunters (not advised to wear white, dark green, brown, tan, dark grey, or black if possible -see vest below if must wear). &lt;br /&gt;* Hat - You loose 20% of your heat through your head! Protect those ears too. &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water - MUST bring! &lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate snack - (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;* Bright clothing -(I don't mean white!) To prevent hunters from mistaking you for game. I'll have 2 orange vests in the party already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advised equipment depending on conditions:&lt;br /&gt;* Gators or snow pants - Suggested, as there could be snow on the trail and you want to keep it out of your boots! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to the *unmarked* park entrance can be found via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Meriden&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=800+Westfield+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good map for a portion of the hike can be found in Map #20, Mattabesett Trail Map #6 in the Connecticut Walk Book published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. The link provided here takes you to a topographic map of the area centered on Chauncey Peak. A number of maps (this topo link included) list the lake as being named Bradley Hubbard Reservoir. You can zoom out on the map by changing the View Scale on the left to 1:50,000 or a little higher to get a context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a general topographical map, see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;amp;n=4603131&amp;amp;e=686860&amp;amp;s=25&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;datum=nad83&amp;amp;layer=DRG25" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.topozone.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;)  is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
