&lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with the teachings of Abraham as channeled by Esther Hicks? The name does not refer to the biblical Abraham. It's just a name that refers to the consciousness of Source Energy/Spirit that speaks through Esther Hicks, and also lives within us all. Esther is just really, really, really good at letting it flow and speak through her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They regularly do 4 hour workshops around the country, when individuals get into what's called the "hotseat", and they get to ask Abraham questions. The questions and the answers always serve everyone in brilliant and inspiring ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've now made viewing these workshops available on-line, and it's fantastic! (There's a $75 fee.) So, we'd like to do this with YOU!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll watch it together on our HD TV, discuss it together during the breaks and when it's over, and share in a potluck lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time we did this it was great learning and fun . Please plan on contributing to cover the workshop fee. How much will depend on how many people participate. Whatever amount it is, it will be a "bargain"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a healthy variety of lunch and snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE, this time more than ever, it's important that you only RSVP yes if you really plan on attending, or if your plans change, to let us know in a timely fashion. Please always be considerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to join us, RSVP on this site or at our MetroWest LoA meetup site here: &lt;br /&gt;
