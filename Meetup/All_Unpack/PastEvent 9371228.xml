We will be showing Mama Mia, for those who missed it, and for those who would like to see it again (and again and again....). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring popcorn, candy, soda (or wine), etc. Make it light and easy. This is a chance to get together and talk about how we made it thru the holidays (sigh), and enjoy a fun flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now we will need a low key, stress free, inexpensive night out. So come on down to Pat's place and enjoy getting together once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a joint meetup with Spice of Life too Short&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231633964000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229865386000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night - Mama Mia and Socializing (at Member's House)</name><id>9371228</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231027200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/9371228/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
