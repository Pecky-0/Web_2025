Wait a minute...got an idea, (the ideal idea man inspires me) how about we rotate the tiara every 15 minutes. Let me know if you want to be crowned with your 15 minute(s) reign (of fame).&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there until about 8 so don't worry if you can't get there during the food special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Encourage you to pay as you order or maintain your own tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>As you walk through the entrance the bar will be in front of you and I should be as well</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203801034000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>You know you want to and besides Leo says it is a great place for happy hour.</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203292401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fire + Ice, where the cool side is always cool and the hot side is always hot</name><id>7351466</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203627600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/7351466/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/c/global_3255324.jpeg</photo_url></item>
