Its very important that we &lt;br /&gt;have a true headcount, and not worry that  your late or lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every hiker is important on a hike, especially if we divide the &lt;br /&gt;hike into a fast and slow group, or if there is an injury. Review the trail maps and itinerary available in the White Mountain Guidebook. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This group will average a 1pm turn around time. If trail or hiker conditions slow the group, you need to understand that the goal for the day can change and we must start back to end the hike safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;NEHM disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hiker profile is complete so we can verify that your qualified to join us on this White Mountain hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling is always advised and a great way to get to know your fellow members.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>parking lot.
