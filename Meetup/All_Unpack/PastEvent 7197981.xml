A brief description of the first seminar:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people have searched to find inner peace. Yet few have found it. Why is it so elusive? What keeps us from being at peace in our daily lives - with the people around us, and within our own beings? There are so many reasons inner peace is so unattainable, and most of them involve things we can directly affect and change. Come to this seminar, and learn how to begin the transformative journey towards your own inner peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome to join us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
