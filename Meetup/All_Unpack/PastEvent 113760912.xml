Distance: 12-14 Miles &lt;br /&gt;

Time Duration: 7 hours &lt;br /&gt;

Blaze Orange: Not Required &lt;br /&gt;

The GBH's 7000 acre reservation is located south of Boston in the towns of Milton, Canton, Randolph, Braintree, Dedham and Quincy. With more than 125 miles of roads and trails in this reservation there's a meetup group devoted to this one area. &lt;br /&gt;

The usual advisories apply in terms of hydration (recommend 2-3 liters of water,) plenty of snacks, thick sole and sturdy boots, and no cotton. With this distance and elevation one should not take this hike lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the good stuff!! I thought it would be interesting to go without a specific hike in mind and go down the trails that look appealing to us (hence the title, &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;By the Seats of Our Pants&lt;/span&gt;). Yes, I will have a trail map.  &lt;br /&gt;
