Stories that are, in fact, already posted, so we've got lots of time to read and comment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope everyone's having a good month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rudi&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rudi Dornemann</member_name><member_id>9690439</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286533778000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Science Fiction Writers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Science-Fiction-Writers-Group</urlname><id>1313705</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>ROCKETSHIP UNICORN</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284602073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wow!
