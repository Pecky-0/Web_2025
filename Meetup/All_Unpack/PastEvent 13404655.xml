While these elements are key, there is an often overlooked piece of the puzzle that separates the good photos from the amazing ones: Art Direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come explore this fascinating side of Fashion Communication as we discuss and put on a mockup (Read: very simple) Photo shoot and discuss the Styling and Art that is Art Directing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local professionals, including our very own Ron Ranere will be leading the discussion and photoshoot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any topics you want to see covered (read: overview) or know some local Art directors and stylists that you think can add to or co-lead the discussion (including yourself), feel free to let us know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the activities that will be taking place.
