<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Lets bring in spring with a bike ride on the cape.  The Shining Sea Bike path is 10.7 miles one way.  We can meet at the end that is on Rt 151 in Falmouth, ride it down and back and then go out someplace in Falmouth to rehydrate and have something to eat.  I know we have some locals from the Falmouth area that were interested in doing this so I hope they can make a suggestion as to where to go for food and drink.  If we plan to be back at the start of the trail by 5 that should allow everyone to ride at their own pace and enjoy the scenery.  This is stricly based on it being good weather so its an enjoyable ride.  You can find a map of the bike path on line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first event I have ever planned so any suggestions, hints are welcome.   &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe </member_name><member_id>8983663</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271182605000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268860283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Falmouth Bike Ride</name><id>12916219</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271008800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/12916219/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
