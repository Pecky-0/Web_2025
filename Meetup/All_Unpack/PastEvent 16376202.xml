Recreational - Players possessing basic skills/fundamentals of the game.  Laid-back game with focus on repetition of the basics. Low Intermediate - Players with some experience playing in informal  settings (family gatherings, etc) Should be familiar with 4-2 formation  (middle front setter).  The entrance to the gym is on Cambridge Street opposite Harvard Market.  The nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street and Roberts  Road.  INSTRUCTIONS: * Please RSVP if you plan on attending. RSVP's will close on the day of  the game at 11 AM. If you show up at the game but do not have a "Yes"  RSVP, you will not be guaranteed to get playing time. * Please be serious about RSVP's. If you RSVP "Yes" and don't show up,  it means you have prevented someone else from attending. Also, please  change your RSVP if you find out you can't play, as soon as possible.  Changing the RSVP a few hours before the game time means that there will  be less people who can play, as most people prefer some advance notice  that there are spots available.  The cost of the meetup will be $5. Please pay the organizer when you  arrive before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of the  court rental.  The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk  from the T stop.  Parking near the school on Sundays is generally easy to find, as meters  and residential parking rules are generally not enforced on Sundays  (parking signs should say "EX SUNDAY" or similar).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>10355700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>10</waitlist_count><updated>1297023055000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296439519000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Recreational/Low Intermediate Indoor Volleyball</name><id>16376202</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297018800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/16376202/</event_url></item>
