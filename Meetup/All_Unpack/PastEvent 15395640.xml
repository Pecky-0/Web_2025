Any of you who watched the weather with Hilton Caderly used to watch the radar loop spin around in north central Connecticut.  This is where that radar was stationed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hiking the Shenipsit Trail in the state's blue blaze system on the way up and then trying some other trails on the way down to make a loop.  This will be a 9.83 mile in, up, loop, and back kind of a trip.  This is a beautiful section with good views of Massachusetts from the tower at the top at 1075'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike would start from the blue blazed Shenipsit trailhead on Hopkins Rd., a dirt road just off of Rte. 140 in Ellington across from Lake Bonair. The hike will be moderate to high moderate given some up/down on the trail and the length.  Plan on being out for 5.5 to 7.5 hours depending how fast we go. We should be back by 4 PM at the latest (sunset is 4:24 PM). There are ways we could shorten the return hike by up to 1 mi. if a situation calls for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet and park on the shoulder of the Hopkins Rd. dirt road about .1 mile from the intersection with Rte. 140.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan on wearing hiking boots, bring 1 - 2 quarts of water, and some trail food/lunch for energy.  We will break at the top for lunch.  Day pack would be great to hold it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total distance from Hopkins Rd. start - some landmarks we will intersect:&lt;br /&gt;* 2.8 miles to trail intersect with Sykes Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 3.3 miles to trail intersect with Parker Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 4.5 miles to peak &amp;amp; observation tower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total distance from observation tower at peak - some landmarks we will intersect:&lt;br /&gt;* 1.3 miles to trail intersect with Webster Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 1.73 miles to trail intersect with Sykes Rd. and blue blazed trail (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 4.08 miles to rejoin with blue blazed trail&lt;br /&gt;* 5.34 miles to return at Hopkins Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location/Directions for meetup location (Hopkins Rd.
