There is a large bar on the main level with a well-designed dance area downstairs.  As always, feel free to bring a friend or two, and we'll see you FRIDAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: Meet up time is 9pm.  We will meet at Tonic, at the main bar (you see it when you first walk in.)  If you cannot find the group, please call me.  Please meet us before 10pm, as this place will get crowded and finding people becomes difficult.  Expect a cover around $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site.  For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:  1316 Commonwealth Ave w/ cross street: Griggs Street.
