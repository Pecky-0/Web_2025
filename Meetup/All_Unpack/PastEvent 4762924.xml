Muffin didn't have a chance.  Our hearts go out to the Bardin family, Sheryl, Matt and Kelsey regarding this tragic loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you next Sunday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1128472184000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1126461982000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Maltese October Meetup</name><id>4762924</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1128272400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/4762924/</event_url></item>
