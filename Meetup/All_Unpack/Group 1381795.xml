Connections and Friends is a sister group of our other group on the North shore, which is A Circle of Friends out of Newburyport.  The intent is to bring the 2 areas of the North Shore together and socialize, have fun and make friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a group of singles aged 35+, who like to explore, have fun, socialize and make new friends. Some events include dining out, outdoor activities, community service, dancing, and other enjoyable events. Sometimes are events are open to children, which will be posted on the individual event page. Check out our calendar for upcoming activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we like to have a lot of fun, we do have some rules, which are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Have and show respect to your fellow members&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 • Pay your yearly dues: $5.00* (YES for the whole year)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 • RSVP for the events your going to attend and if your plans change, please make sure you change your RSVP on the site&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 • Most of all…. Have fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sign up for one or two of the upcoming events, make some new friends, have a good time and enjoy your Connections to new friends. We look forward to meeting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Organizer,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not sure you want to join Connections and Friends? Would you like to attend an event before joining? Feel free to contact me and we will be more than happy to have you attend as a guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Wondering what the yearly dues are for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 In order to have a group on Meetup, the organizer has to pay a monthly site fee. The dues help to defray the cost of this for the organizers. Any excess money collected will be used toward defraying the cost of future events for all paying members.  The membership fee is non refundable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.89</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1234460877000</created><lat>42.6800003052</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>264</id><urlkey>friends</urlkey><name>Friends</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>498</id><urlkey>singles</urlkey><name>Singles</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>713</id><urlkey>diningout</urlkey><name>Dining Out</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1091</id><urlkey>newlysingle</urlkey><name>Newly Single</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1273</id><urlkey>newintown</urlkey><name>New In Town</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1998</id><urlkey>travel</urlkey><name>Travel</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10261</id><urlkey>men</urlkey><name>Men's Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10581</id><urlkey>social</urlkey><name>Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15117</id><urlkey>fun-times</urlkey><name>Fun Times</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17571</id><urlkey>dancing</urlkey><name>Dancing</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17866</id><urlkey>meeting-new-people</urlkey><name>Meeting New People</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>51463</id><urlkey>womans-social</urlkey><name>Woman's Social</name></topics_item></topics><name>Connections and Friends</name><id>1381795</id><members>340</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>2153112</member_id><name>Donna </name></organizer><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/1/2/600_155046162.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/1/2/highres_155046162.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>155046162</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/1/2/thumb_155046162.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Ipswich</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/</link><lon>-70.8499984741</lon></item>
