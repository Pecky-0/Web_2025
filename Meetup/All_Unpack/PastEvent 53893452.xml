Eight of its peaks are above 4,000 feet. We'll attempt Mt. Hight. To the east of the range lies the forested valley of the Wild River and the rocky peaks of the Baldface Group. On a clear day the Atlantic can be seen glistening beyond Sebago Lake to the southeast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT 4,675 feet above sea level Mt. Hight will be our most ambitious summit of the winter hiking season. With about 3,200 feet of vertcal climbing this playground east of the Presidentials is in the shadow of Carter Dome and my heart. Our efforts will be well rewarded with the 360 degree views that&amp;nbsp;Ole Man Winter enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first leg of this adventure will begin on the 19 mile Brook Trail. The parking lot (e-1,487')for this jaunt is on the right hand side of route 16 and one mile north of the Mt. Washington Auto Road. We'll follow this frequently hiked trail (used by hikers going to the Carter Notch Hut) for 1.9 miles. The real fun begins as we turn west/left onto the Carter Dome Trail. Over this flexuous pathwe'll gain about 1,600 vertical feet over 1.9 miles. The grade is moderate but relentless. As trail steepens&amp;nbsp;a series of switchbacks will deliver us softly to the Zeta Pass. Upon reaching the Zeta Pass the Carter Dome Trail and the Carter Mariah Trail are the same trail heading south (also it's the AT), we'll take this right hand/south turn. After 0.2 of a mile we'll bear slight left toward the Summit of Mt. Hight on the Carter Mariah Trail. From this junction we'll cover the last 0.6 of a mile over&amp;nbsp;steep terrain&amp;nbsp;exposed to weather. (Continuing on to the Carter Dome, 4,832', is 0.4 of a mile for peak baggers. It's unlikely&amp;nbsp;we'll have time for that summit.)&amp;nbsp;We'll return to the parking lot via the same path. Total mileage about 8.4 miles, hiking time estimate 7 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather and Trailing conditions: Too early to tell. Check back. Although the AMC Visitor's Center got 12 inches of new show this past weekend. Tip: Dressing comfortably at the summit would enable you to enjoy the breezy but wonderous view.&lt;/p&gt;
