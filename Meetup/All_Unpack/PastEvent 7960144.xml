<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ok here's the planned route. Looks like Route 1 the whole way then a bit of 114 then 1 the way back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=11917844292772560224,41.451858,-71.496887&amp;amp;saddr=1670+Soldiers+Field+Rd+Brighton,+MA&amp;amp;daddr=1284+North+Main+St+Providence,+RI+to:1080+Kingstown+Rd,+Wakefield,+RI+02879+(Twisted+Throttle)+to:1180+West+Main+Rd+Middletown,+RI+to:Boston,+MA&amp;amp;mra=pi&amp;amp;mrcr=3&amp;amp;dirflg=h&amp;amp;sll=41.856265,-71.453705&amp;amp;sspn=0.362091,1.002502&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.855498,-71.340065&amp;amp;spn=0.133484,0.376282&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=12" target="_blank"&gt;Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any adjustment needed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold on, I've been informed of a few things so I'm going to change/add some things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the minimum cc's for this would be 125cc. &lt;br /&gt;I plan to make this 0% highway. &lt;br /&gt;Average Speed may be 30-50mph&lt;br /&gt;We won't get lost because I have my GPS&lt;br /&gt;I am finding the best route available for this. But I've probably never personally been on the route though since I've never been down there. &lt;br /&gt;Only been to Providence and Warwick but by highway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go to Java Speed Scooters in Providence, RI&lt;br /&gt;It's a scoot dealer / coffee place.&lt;br /&gt;I've never been there myself though So I don't know what else to say.&lt;br /&gt;It's first on the way down because it's closer to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erik has told me that Twisted Throttle is having an open house that day too. They are located in Kingston RI&lt;br /&gt;I've never been there either but I've bought stuff online from them. It's a place with alot, if not all motorcycle/scoot accessories&lt;br /&gt;Then go south a bit more to Kingston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then after that Eastward towards Middletown, RI to Vespa Newport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then loop our way home&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find the silver burgy</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211849238000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Just because you can!</why><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211083767000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Scooting</name><id>7960144</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211641200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/7960144/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/3/f/global_4157439.jpeg</photo_url></item>
