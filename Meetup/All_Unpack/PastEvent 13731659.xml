[b]Details[/b]

I now know the time of the movie; we will be seeing the 7:00 show. 

I will wear my red meetup hat. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables by the big window. If the movie is downstairs, I'll be waiting behind the rope across from the refreshment stand. I'll be at the theater at 6:30 minutes, and we should go in and get seats at 6:45.

I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.

If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt (Jolie) swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: "Who Is Salt?"
