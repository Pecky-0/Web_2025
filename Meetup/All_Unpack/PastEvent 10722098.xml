Carla and I would love to have the group fly up to Lake Winnipesaukee in Laconia and join us again for dinner. Last year we had seven planes and 14 pilots/passengers visit us while on vacation.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out last years pictures and comments. On our site go to &amp;quot;calendar&amp;quot;, then &amp;quot;past list view&amp;quot; and scroll down and find the July 16th 2008 fly-out. This was a good time but check it out for yourself.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, here's the deal..... the group will fly to Laconia (KLCI) 62.9 nautical miles. Leaving a little bit earlier than usual 5:00 PM   &lt;br /&gt;Louise will get the loaner car squared away from Sky Bright at LCI to the docks. I have room for us in my 24 footer that we will take to dinner.  This year we are going to the LakeHouse Grill  located right on the water in Meredith Bay. Great restaurant and views... I will take care of our dinner reservations. Please RSVP I need an accurate count for the boat and dinner.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't forget to ask your loved one or a friend to join you. Your not going to want to miss this one and don't forget that camera...we love pictures.   &lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep your Wednesday nights free...thats Fly-out night!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KLCI" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thecman.com/restaurants/lakehouse/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thecman.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you can make it!  &lt;br /&gt;Gary and Carla  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP ASAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAIN DATE THURSDAY JULY 16TH&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248020805000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245812428000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RAIN DATE THURSDAY 16TH  2nd Annual, Laconia Dinner.
