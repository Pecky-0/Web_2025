This weekâ€™s game is at 8pm on Saturday night, we will have the game on both floors but if you prefer the 2nd floor please get in early to get your seat. Each Saturday night we have a DJ that plays, this week he will play but only after the game and our kitchen will stay open through out the game so come hungry and thirsty. Hope you have a great week, go pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Butler&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Packers Boston &amp; Ray Butler</member_name><member_id>9971064</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295198635000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greenbaypackersboston</urlname><id>1489502</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Green Bay Packers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294691862000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Green Bay at Atlanta</name><id>15997124</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295139600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greenbaypackersboston/events/15997124/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/0/global_9669904.jpeg</photo_url></item>
