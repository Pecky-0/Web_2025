There is a new young chef at  Akasaka on loan from NY, he is really amazing I've had some of the best meals I've ever had in my long japanese eating career there lately and would love to share this experience with others! This will be as it was last time, Pay as you go kinda thing. We all had our own items and then shared some also, So try to bring cash if possible so we don't have to split the bill across debit cards and what-not.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208902299000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>If sushi calls to you in your sleep and the just the mention of it brings a smile to your face.....you know why you should come.....</why><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202601953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Middle of CT Sushi March Meeting</name><id>7299631</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208728800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ct/events/7299631/</event_url></item>
