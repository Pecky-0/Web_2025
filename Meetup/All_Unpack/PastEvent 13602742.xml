Come out and join us to meet old friends and make new friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picnic &amp;amp; Games at Fort Adams State Park, Newport RI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We suggest everyone bring a blanket and/or chairs, lunch with beverage for themselves as well as  snacks, salad, fruit, and/or dessert to share. We will not be grilling at this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We currently have Frisbee, Croquet, and Bouche Ball for games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring other games if you have them and if there is space we will set them up! &lt;br /&gt;E-mail Adam or Lonnie with any questions &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where we will be at Fort Adams&lt;/b&gt;: When you enter Fort Adams take 1st left ...you will see a Blue Sign for Fort Adams right before left with an arrow pointing to the Eisenhower House. Drive straight up that hill (winding road) until you see water and drive straight onto the dirt path road - parking is on left.  This is a nice area with flat ground for playing games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You have missed first left if you go by gate and come to a stop sign.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Meetup group will be set up where we can in the field hopefully facing the water. We will put 4 small orange cones on the ends of one of the blankets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please write down cell #'s given for Adam &amp;amp; Lonnie when you RSVP - in case you can't find us once you enter park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have beautiful views of the Newport Harbor and Narragansett Bay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to: Fort Adams Pt State Park &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.riparks.com/fortadams.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.riparks.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check back for updates and if it rains we will postpone the picnic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Read Directions and if any problems when in park call Adam - 401-699-7304 - or Lonnie - 401-829-8516 -</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lonnie</member_name><member_id>6911660</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275404690000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274894262000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Picnic &amp; Games - Let's Get Out &amp; Enjoy Nice Weather with Great Views!</name><id>13602742</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275242400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/13602742/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/f/global_15314047.jpeg</photo_url></item>
