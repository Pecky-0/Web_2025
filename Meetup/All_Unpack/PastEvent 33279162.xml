If it turns out to be a nice day we can hit a nearby playground or take a long walk along the Neponset River to Tenean Beach. If it's pouring the kids can watch us play foosball in our garage! Come any time before 4pm - text me at 201-743-8574 when you're close and I'll let you know if we're home or out. I'll make coffee and something else, please bring a snack to share. We are not far from 93 and a &amp;lt;10-minute walk from Ashmont station. Street parking is not usually difficult on my street, but if you have to go around the block, there are usually spots on Beaumont and Berkshire Sts.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yooree Losordo</member_name><member_id>7915117</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316103136000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315862397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rainy Day with Yooree &amp; Elsa</name><id>33279162</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316095200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/33279162/</event_url></item>
