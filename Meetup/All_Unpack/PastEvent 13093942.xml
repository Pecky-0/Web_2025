<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>whoops! I origanally posted the wrong date. This happens the third Sunday of every month (in the warm months).So April 18th is the correct date. &lt;br /&gt;Bring your old unwanted electronics and sell them here. My friend and I plan on getting at least 1 spot to sell our stuff. Print the flier to get a dollar of if you come as a buyer. Or contact them to get a space to sell you stuff. We plan on getting a space in the parking lot that is outside on the street level if the weather is nice. In order to do this we need to be there early to get the best spot. Come hang out and brain storm about ideas for &amp;quot;We Are Change&amp;quot; type actions. We will also be displaying 9/11 truth banners at our space and distributing/ showing dvd's. We will also have 9/11 truth fliers for anybody that wants some. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sellers Setup 7am) Everyone else cab get in starting at 9 am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the MIT flea info Web Site: &lt;br /&gt;WWW.SWAPFEST.US&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mark WeAreChangeBoston.org</member_name><member_id>4641561</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271768946000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270495178000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4/18 MIT Flea Market</name><id>13093942</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271595600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/13093942/</event_url></item>
