We'll start with the traditional coffee and conversation at 3:00 PM, and Eugene's talk will follow brief announcements at 3:30 PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It is not necessary to RSVP for this event; I'm listing it as a meetup so that you can get e-mail reminders from meetup.com)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228781211000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225997109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humanist Association of Connecticut Monthly Meeting</name><id>9107530</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227470400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/9107530/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/d/global_5157805.jpeg</photo_url></item>
