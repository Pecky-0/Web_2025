And imagine that, in this resort's hundreds of treatment rooms, work could be processed in real time in the native language of the subconscious mind: metaphor and imagery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In tonight's group hypnosis session, attendees visiting The Spa will find it not only interesting and fun, but also insightful and changemaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll visit the Room of Being Slender, the Healing Room, the Room of Creativity, the Room of Forgiveness, and a few more interesting rooms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a pillow, mat and blanket, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All proceeds to benefit Our Weeping Angel Foundation, a Hingham-based non-profit foundation, which helps people in distress pay for alternative healing treatments and holistic medicine. Suggested donation is $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preregistration required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Kathryn McGlynn, Certified Hypnotist and Success Coach, at the number above with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit her webpage for more info: www.hypnosis.ws&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn McGlynn</member_name><member_id>4512047</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274918473000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers of the Mind</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Past-Life-Regression-Metaphysical-Hypnosis-Group</urlname><id>1426411</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Past Life Regression &amp; Professional Hypnosis Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274570983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hypnosis Seminar - The Spa of Your Inner Mind</name><id>13565151</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274828400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Past-Life-Regression-Metaphysical-Hypnosis-Group/events/13565151/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/d/global_8022349.jpeg</photo_url></item>
