<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I and my friend (Darryl) will be peakbagging Vose Spur (NE100 Highest list) &amp;amp; Carrigain (WHITES 4K ftr) on 9/25(Sat).   Please join us if you're interested in this event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cross posted hiking event from &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/hiking-490/"&gt;my own hiking meetup group (Hike / Snowshoe Vermont).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at the trailhead of Signal Ridge Trail on Sawyer River Rd, Bartlett, NH at 7:30AM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the hiking plan: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll hike on the maintained trails - Signal Ridge Tr 1.7mi, then Carrigain Notch Trail approx. 1.9 mi. &lt;br /&gt;Since there is no maintained trail to grab Vose Spur summit (3862 ft), we'll start bushwhacking from  small cairns on Carrigain Notch Trail about less than a mile.  I've heard from several people who have done that this ascent bushwhacking is very steep.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding summit canister and signing in at Vose Spur, we take a break and hike out (bushwhacking) with the same route in order to get back to the maintained trail (Carrigain Notch Trail). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not interested in peakbagging Mt Carrigain, you can go back to the parking lot on Carrigain North Trail &amp;amp; Signal Ridge Trail by your own.  Otherwise, we'll continue our hike Carrigain North Trial toward North, then West about 5 miles to reach Mt Carrigain summit.   After taking some break, we hike out to the parking lot for another 5 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this hiking event includes bushwhacking, it's difficult to estimate hiking hours...but it will be somewhere &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;9-11 hours&lt;/span&gt; w/ approx. 15 miles in total.   So please don't forget to bring headlamp just in case.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=226452"&gt;This is one example of route from TH to Vose Spur summit.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is strenuous hike.  If you never hiked any 4K footers, this is not for your hike.  Also, if you haven't hiked several months to high elevation mountains, this is not for your hike either.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My Car is Honda CR-V (blue)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tomoko</member_name><member_id>8122788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285812109000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284870491000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vose Spur(3862 ft) bushwhacking &amp; Mt Carrigain(4700 ft) Hike</name><id>14819008</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285414200000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14819008/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/a/global_17612186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
