Al and Jaymz are a couple of vegans that have come to Maple Farm a number of times and Jaymz cooks like there's no tomorrow! They have some wonderful animal friends living there so we will still be able to give some love. I hope to see all of you with vegan yummies in hand :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please park on the street and don't block anyone's drive way. The location is right off of Grafton Street not far from Quan Yin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions you can reach me at 508-459-1074, Meghan at 508-963-0044 or you can email me as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dreads, glasses and a whole lot of veganess ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309486802000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225653316000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp December Meetup</name><id>9078528</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228672800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/9078528/</event_url></item>
