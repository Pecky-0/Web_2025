Beautiful and quiet pond with an intricate shoreline, also a stretch of river at the north end. We'll be on the water approximately 1 1/2 hours. To get there, I suggest going on mapquest.com and mapping Brooks Pond Road, North Brookfield, you'll see where the pond touches the road at the southern tip, that's where the parking and launch area are. You can either take Rt 148 to Brooks Pond Rd, or Rt 31 to Northwest Rd to Brooks Pond Rd. Reminder: PFDs required to be worn.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349579530000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349012103000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle at Brooks Pond, North Brookfield</name><id>84771112</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349528400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/84771112/</event_url></item>
