This will be a chance for new members to meet the current cast, do warmups and drills together, and learn a few improv games. You can also hear about the cast's premiere performance at Somerville Home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read through the following website before arriving: &lt;a href="http://greenlightwiki.com/improv/Tips_And_Techniques" target="_blank"&gt;http://greenlightwiki...&lt;/a&gt;. The site contains helpful guidelines and suggestions about improvisation. Of course, this is just a primer. Most of our learning comes by doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all make it out!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245609947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casting Call for All Members</name><id>10701640</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246224600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/10701640/</event_url></item>
