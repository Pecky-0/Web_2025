&lt;p&gt;This is our weekly meetup. We will start the group by talking about our recent mindful&amp;nbsp;experiences, followed by listening to a talk about mindfulness. This week we'll be listening part 2 of Pema Chodron's talk - "True Happiness", cultivating the conditions that can bring sustainable joy into our lives. Pema is a popular author and mindfulness/meditation teacher, and she runs a Buddhist abbey in Nova Scotia. The talk will be followed by a short meditation, and then a chance to discuss the weekly talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world. We'd love to have you join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Please try to get there by 6:00pm as they have asked us to keep the door locked due to recent security issues. If you arrive after 6pm and there's no one at the door, please ring the night buzzer (it's right by the door and is labeled as there are two buzzers). We'll come down and get you. Hope to see you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298385777000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288822783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pema Chordron: True Happiness</name><id>jdptpypdbcc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298329200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/16633591/</event_url></item>
