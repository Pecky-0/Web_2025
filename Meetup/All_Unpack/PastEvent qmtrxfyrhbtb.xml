<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Beware - GPS or even the map on the Meetup site may send you to the wrong place! The building is right across from the Boston Harbor Hotel, and across from Panera. From South Station or Aquarium subway, it is a short walk down the Greenway. My cell phone number is 617-818-2923. Feel free to call if you're having trouble finding the group. We usually go out to dinner afterwards between 630-7, generally to Chinatown (we decide each time).  Do not worry about being there right on time - many people come late due to work, but please call if you will be there after 645 as we may leave International Place around that time.&lt;/p&gt;
