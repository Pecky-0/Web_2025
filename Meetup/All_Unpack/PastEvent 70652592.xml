&lt;p&gt;It's an opportunity for Art Enrichment for Atheists! Deb writes: "Friday night looks like a fun opportunity to view the exhibit, in addition to a film strip and drinks." The event description: "Since the dawn of time, artists have attempted to depict visions of the sky and heavens. Learn about this history while enjoying a casual evening of science and art. Tour the exhibition Josiah McElheny: Some Pictures of the Infinite, then join in a gallery conversation around McElheny’s Island Universe and how artists and scientists visualize the beginning of our universe. Grab a drink and head outside to the Putnam Investments Plaza to take in a 'film strip' (just like the ones from high school!) about the history of these heavenly depictions. End the evening with stargazing on the waterfront, just outside the ICA. FREE with museum admission."&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hello all.
