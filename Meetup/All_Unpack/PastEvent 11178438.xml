Since a lot of people who attended the actual sushi meetup on 8/13 were impressed by the restaurant, Ichi-go Ichi-e, there was considerable interest in going again to try the hibachi more than the sushi. As a result, I'm co-ordinating this non-sushi meetup informally, mainly as a courtesy to try to give the restaurant a headcount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: This event will start at 6:00pm, an hour earlier than a regular sushi meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who do not know, Japanese hibachi style restaurants seat the group around a hot-plate cooking surface and have a chef prepare meals in front of the diners, typically in a fairly elaborate and showy manner as a theatrical experience.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zigamorph</member_name><member_id>2030415</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265910458000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ri</urlname><id>197204</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251046395000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Non-sushi meetup: ICHI-GO ICHI-E (East Providence), Thu, 8/27, 6:00pm</name><id>11178438</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251410400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ri/events/11178438/</event_url></item>
