<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the last weekend for this well-reviewed exhibit of masterworks, so it may be mobbed; I will be there sometime between 10 am, when it opens, and 10:30. Check to see if your local library has a pass, otherwise, admission is $15, not sure if the exhibit is extra or not although the website makes it look like it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/121-golden_dutch_and_flemish_masterworks_from_the_rose-marie_and_eijk_van_otterloo_collection" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/121-golden_dutch_and_flemish_masterworks_from_the_rose-marie_and_eijk_van_otterloo_collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly seventy paintings from the internationally acclaimed collection of Eijk and Rose-Marie van Otterloo illuminate one of the greatest artistic and cultural chapters in history. The Van Otterloo collection is virtually unrivaled for its masterworks by the leading Dutch and Flemish artists of the 1600s: Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jacob van Ruisdael, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Aelbert Cuyp and many others. At PEM, over 20 examples of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish furniture and decorative arts, also from the Van Otterloo collection, are shown in the company of these glorious portraits, still lifes, landscapes and interiors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to see the Surrealist exhibit that opens that weekend there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1929 to 1932, Man Ray and Lee Miller -- two giants of the European Surrealism movement -- lived together in Paris, first as teacher and student, and later as lovers. Their mercurial relationship resulted in some of the most powerful work of each artist's career, and helped shape the course of modern art. Combining rare vintage photographs, paintings, sculpture and drawings, this exhibition tells the story of the artists' brief but intense association and reveals the nature of their creative partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
