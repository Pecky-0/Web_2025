Park and meet in the Long Beach parking lot at the end next to the Tides restaurant. We will walk through the town and along the beaches, taking in the views along the way. Lunch at the Tides afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tidesnahant.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tidesnahan...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Wilson Rd # B&lt;br /&gt;Nahant, MA 01908&lt;br /&gt;(781) 593-7500&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some comments from the web:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For visitors wishing to use our beaches, there is public parking at Long Beach which is the beach on your left as you enter Nahant via the Causeway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Native Americans called the area &amp;quot;Nahant,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;the point&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;almost an island.&amp;quot; There are several World War II Bunkers in Nahant. Located inside Trimountain, and East Point, they were initially designed to defend Boston Harbor and the surrounding waters from a possible attack during the war. During the cold war, the installation at East Point housed Nike missiles intended to stop a nuclear attack on Boston. The facility at Trimountain was for &amp;quot;aiming&amp;quot; the missiles. &lt;br /&gt;  The town might be hosting filming for a Scorese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio this summer, 2008.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208379224000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206929027000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discover Nahant walk</name><id>7636927</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208097000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7636927/</event_url></item>
