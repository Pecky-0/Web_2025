Imp Face is on the &lt;a href="http://www.nhmountainhiking.com/hike/lists/52view.html" target="_blank"&gt;52 with a view&lt;/a&gt; list and North Carter has views from just below its summit and is on the Trailwrights and YMCA Alpine lists. Weather for Wednesday is looking good as is foliage. If time, energy, and spirit allow we may also visit Mt. Lethe which requires abouit a 100 yard bushwhack off trail. There are two possibilities for routes. One is a loop, but requires a car spot. The other is an out and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPS coordinates&lt;/b&gt;: 44.323239, -71.216854&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=44.323239,-71.216854" target="_blank"&gt;Map of 44.323239, -71.216854 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;: 9.2-11.1 miles &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation gain&lt;/b&gt;: 3950-4400 ft  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Time&lt;/b&gt;: 6 hours and 35 minutes to 7 hours and 45 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trails&lt;/b&gt;: Imp Trail (North Branch), North Carter Trail, Carter-Moriah Trail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snow is present at the higher summits currently, as is temperatures cold enough to make it, so be prepared for it.
