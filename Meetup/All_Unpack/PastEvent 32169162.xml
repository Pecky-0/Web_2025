&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Lola's Tequila Bar &amp;amp; Cantina - on South Water street between Whiskey Republic &amp;amp;The Hot Club (yes, where Blu "used to be" - lol!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the waterfront appears to be safe again post hurricane Irene, AND since I've been expressly instructed that we should not be inside during any potentially nice summer evenings to which I couldn't agree more, AND since this place was suggested AND its on the waterfront, we're going to Lola's Tequila Bar &amp;amp; Cantina! For PVD'ers that have been around awhile, this is where Blu used to be (I think it was briefly something else too). Anyway, its right on the PVD waterfront near the beautifully lit 195 bridge with a view of the river and on a nice, end-of-summer night it really can't be beat. Hopefully we'll be able to grab a table or seating outside and enjoy the last hours of the holiday weekend hanging out with friends!&amp;nbsp;So let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
