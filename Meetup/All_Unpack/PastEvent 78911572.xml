~~~ &lt;br /&gt;

The North Haven Department of Community Services and Recreation, in conjunction with the North Haven Business Community, presents a series of free outdoor concerts for the enjoyment of town residents. All concerts will be held on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. on the Town Green, unless otherwise noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available at the Town Hall Annex and Town Pool lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you become concerned about the weather, you should call the Recreation Center Info-Line at 234-2535 after 5 p.m. If the recording under Special Events/Trips says “there are no cancellations or changes,” then assume the concert is on the Green regardless of the weather. If the concert is moved to the High School, the Info-line will clearly give that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be advised, there is limited seating at the High School and seating is on a first-come, first-serve basis. Food and beverage (including water) will not be allowed in the High School. &lt;br /&gt;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;

It is the last band for the North Haven concert series. Bring a chair to sit on, some snacks to share, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>simone</member_name><member_id>7013797</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346286465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
