<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We have decided to discontinue with Leibniz's Essay (we considered the Monadology just a detour form it) and move on to George Berkeley. We picked: Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists. This is usually mentioned as one of his major works alongside with&lt;br /&gt;A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Knowledge. We probably stay with Berkeley for no more than one meeting and then move on to David Hume and then will &amp;quot;touch on&amp;quot; the French enlightenment with de La Mettrie. Our near future goal is to get to Immanuel Kant (and hopefully to Hegel too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists is available on the internet, amongst others one of the web sites where one can find it is: &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/37/2/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bartleby.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good reading and see you soon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213484644000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211511240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Berkeley: Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics </name><id>7995998</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213311600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/7995998/</event_url></item>
