<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We're looking for just a few people to join us for some improvisational drumming and other percussion at a person's house in Merrimack, NH for 2 hours, from 7 - 9 PM. Although it would help if you have your own drum, I have a couple of extra drums. You don't have to have any drumming experience as long as you have a good sense of rhythm. Since there is limited space, please don't RSVP unless you are sure you can make it. I'll let you know the address after you RSVP. When you RSVP, let me know if you have a drum. &lt;br /&gt;I am listing this with multiple meetup groups and there will be non-meetup people involved too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it this time but would like to try it sometime, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>NeilL</member_name><member_id>3034835</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268525284000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267864464000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>improvisational drumming </name><id>12799271</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268352000000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/12799271/</event_url></item>
