<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After introducing ourselves and maybe sharing an anecdote or two about being naturalists in a largely non-naturalist culture, we could discuss the relationship between having an empirically-based worldview and maintaining an open society.  Given that people will always have different takes on ultimate reality, are some takes better suited to keeping a pluralist society democratic and non-authoritarian?  Is naturalism is more friendly to democracy than other worldviews, and if so, why?  But as always people are welcome to raise their own concerns on the spur of the moment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180451835000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176163330000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Naturalism and the Open Society</name><id>5653827</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179183600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/5653827/</event_url></item>
