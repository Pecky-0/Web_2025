It opened a few years ago as just Mare, but has since been remodeled and put in a raw bar and a wet bar. I find it very friendly now. In addition to shelfish, they offer antipasti, a burger, warm or cold lobster rolls, pasta, seafood entrees and chicken. The restaurant is located at the corner of Richmond and North Streets. If you're walking down the right side of Hanover Street from the Greenway, take your first right. It's on the next corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get there early, join us for a drink at the bar. Please bring cash, as we will not be getting separate checks. Hope you can make it.&lt;/p&gt;
