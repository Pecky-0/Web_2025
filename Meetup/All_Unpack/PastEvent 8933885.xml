Trivia starts at 9pm and goes till approximately 11pm.....&lt;b&gt;but the place&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;gets packed&lt;/b&gt;.  That being said, I plan to get there around 7pm, grab some yum yums and hold a table for any fellow NHCer's who feel like playing.  You need to be there by 8:30 &lt;u&gt;at the latest&lt;/u&gt; to register to play, but if you can come earlier by all means stop by and hang out before hand.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost per person is $2.00.  If more than 5 people attend, we can break up into smaller groups so we can all play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact for the night is: Jeanie (860) 942-4708    &lt;br /&gt; (F.Y.I. reception in Liffey's is kinda sketchy and once trivia starts at 9pm, cell phones are not allowed)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224371179000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223600282000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pub Trivia</name><id>8933885</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224025200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8933885/</event_url></item>
