The hall will be open for films from 9:11 AM til 9:11 PM. There will be snacks and coffee available and it wouldn't hurt to bring tea and other snacks, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some photos and other information about the film festival at the NH 9/11 Truth blog: &lt;a href="http://nhtruth.blogspot.com/2010/03/911-film-festival-in-peterborough-nh-on_28.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://nhtruth.blogsp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The viewing hall is at 12 Depot St., next to the Toadstool Bookstore. There will be posters, fliers, books, DVDs, opportunities to hand out fliers or stand outside with signs, if you'd like to help. Be sure to bring your friends whom you'd like to have see some of the investigative videos about the events of September 11th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to bring important 9/11 videos that you think others should see and obtain copies of DVDs that others have at the film festival to round out your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This effort is in support of education of the public in general, but it is leading up to the vote in Peterborough for instructing Congress to conduct a new investigation of 9/11. This is one of the last towns to vote in the &lt;a href="http://voteforanswersnh.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Vote For Answers NH campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact us for carpooling to the event from the Merrimack Valley area at truth@ijaq.net.&lt;br /&gt;Donations to the Monadnock 9/11 Truth Alliance, the sponsors of the film festival, are appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;See you Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>smiling pony tail guy with glasses</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 11010926</member_name><member_id>11010926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272720974000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272720974000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Peterborough 9/11 Film Festival</name><id>smlhnynhbcb</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272719700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/13348390/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/2/global_13921218.jpeg</photo_url></item>
