&lt;p&gt;Now that Robin has moved back to Salem from Deerfield, NH, she wants to learn the trails of Salem Town Forest.  If she will accept the challenge I will pick a route for her to follow on the trial map and using a map she will lead the hike. &lt;strong&gt;(Don't tell her I said this but she had said the last time she hiked there she had gotten lost and needed to get a ride back to her car. But at least she knew where the road was where she came out of the woods.)&lt;/strong&gt; Come join the fun and see how Robin does.  Remember to bring some bread crumbs to use just in case you think she will get us lost (dog treats would be to risky to use).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Salem Town Forest is located on Shadow Lake Road, not on Castle Road. However, Castle Road forms a U with two entrances on Shadow Lake Road. and the entrance to the Town Forest is in between them on the other side of the road.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346599687000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344551766000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salem Town Forest - Easy Hike - 2.5 - 3(?) miles</name><id>77085432</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346506200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/77085432/</event_url></item>
