Here is a brief synopsis about &lt;u&gt;The Passage&lt;/u&gt; from Amazon.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't have to be a fan of vampire fiction to be enthralled by The Passage, Justin Cronin's blazing new novel. Cronin is a remarkable storyteller (just ask adoring fans of his award-winning Mary and O'Neil), whose gorgeous writing brings depth and vitality to this ambitious epic about a virus that nearly destroys the world, and a six-year-old girl who holds the key to bringing it back. The Passage takes readers on a journey from the early days of the virus to the aftermath of the destruction, where packs of hungry infected scour the razed, charred cities looking for food, and the survivors eke out a bleak, brutal existence shadowed by fear. Cronin doesn't shy away from identifying his &amp;quot;virals&amp;quot; as vampires. But, these are not sexy, angsty vampires (you wonâ€™t be seeing &amp;quot;Team Babcock&amp;quot; t-shirts any time soon), and they are not old-school, evil Nosferatus, either. These are a creation all Cronin's own--hairless, insectile, glow-in-the-dark mutations who are inextricably linked to their makers and the one girl who could destroy them all. A huge departure from Cronin's first two novels, The Passage is a grand mashup of literary and supernatural, a stunning beginning to a trilogy that is sure to dazzle readers of both genres. --Daphne Durham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is a review from Stephen King:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Every so often a novel-reader's novel comes along: an enthralling, entertaining story wedded to simple, supple prose, both informed by tremendous imagination. Summer is the perfect time for such books, and this year readers can enjoy the gift of Justin Cronin's The Passage. Read fifteen pages and you will find yourself captivated; read thirty and you will find yourself taken prisoner and reading late into the night. It has the vividness that only epic works of fantasy and imagination can achieve. What else can I say? This: read this book and the ordinary world disappears.&amp;quot;--Stephen King&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask the bartender or hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Craig</member_name><member_id>8977543</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279132813000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276120447000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup Monthly Meetup</name><id>dphrnynkbrb</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279062000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/13752985/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/6/global_15618566.jpeg</photo_url></item>
