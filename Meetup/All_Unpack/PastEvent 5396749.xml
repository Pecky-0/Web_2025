Shiu Mai! YÃ¼ Chi Gao! &lt;br /&gt;Steamed buns! Sticky rice! Egg tarts and tea!&lt;br /&gt;Chicken feet! Jellyfish!! Trrripe!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for our now-monthly, all-social dimsum events, in Boston's Chinatown. We can talk geek, and eat ourselves silly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, this is probably not for the vegetarian'd, or those following any sort of strict dietary regimen. The bill will be split evenly among all who attend, so the more the merrier/cheaper! (Cost is usually less than $15 per person.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for non-drivers (note that parking in Chinatown can be difficult):&lt;br /&gt;From South Station (Red Line):&lt;br /&gt;    Walk south on Atlantic Street.&lt;br /&gt;    Turn right and cross at the first traffic light.&lt;br /&gt;    As you walk along Beach Street, you will see the Chinatown gate.&lt;br /&gt;    Hei La Moon will be on your right, under the parking garage. &lt;br /&gt;    We'll meet in the lobby inside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE IF YOU ARRIVE AFTER 11:30 -- will have probably gone inside. If you've seen us before and can pick us out of the dining hall, come on in.  If you're a newbie, there's really no easy way to find us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://pam_phillips.home.comcast.net/TCC4335/L-heilamoon.html" target="_blank"&gt;Hei La Moon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540907000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168904567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dimsum Meetup!</name><id>5396749</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170518400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/5396749/</event_url></item>
