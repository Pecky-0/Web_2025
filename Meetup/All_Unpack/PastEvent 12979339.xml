Those who participate may be surprised to learn precisely how much of the puzzle falls into each category. This first session will summarize the relevant and well-documented geographical, historical, archaeological, linguistic, and literary background, during the period from around 100 BCE to 100 CE, of Jewish, Roman, Greek, and neighboring cultures that serve as the minimum setting for a clear understanding of the known and probable origins of what we will call “Early Christianity.” The presentation will be based on handouts and an analytical viewing of the first hour of the four-hour &lt;i&gt;Frontline&lt;/i&gt; series “From Jesus to Christ,” with an introduction to the paperback “From Jesus to Christianity: How Four Generations of Visionaries and Storytellers Created the New Testament and Christian Faith,” by L. Michael White, one of the principal contributors responsible for the TV series. Other sessions will follow at intervals of roughly one month, and each will include additional handouts and one hour of DVD materials from the &lt;i&gt;Frontline&lt;/i&gt; series and two other sources. David Schafer will present all sessions and lead the discussion. For further information call 203-281-6232.
