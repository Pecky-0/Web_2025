We'll meet in front of the The Music Hall an hour before the first fillm for a short walk around Portsmouth and to get in line for seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to come to just the first film, or stay between films when they rush us out of the theater only to let us back in line for the second film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure to order your tickets online ahead of time as these films do sell out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6:30 pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Telluride by the Sea: Kisses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Christmas day Dylan (Shane Curry), a sullen asthmatic eleven-year-old boy living in a filthy Dublin slum, flees his father's drunken violence with the eleven-year-old Kylie (Kelly O'Neill), the bold, determined girl next door. Hoping to find Dylan's older brother (he ran away from home two years earlier), they instead discover, to their surprise, how deeply they love each other. They also learn an array of other essential life lessons, including a bit about &amp;quot;the musical god&amp;quot; Dylan is named for. In this elegant, seemingly uncomplicated coming-of-age gem, writer-director-cinematographer Lance Daly coaxes superlative performances from his two young leads and creates a compelling image of Dublin, one that's both sordid and magical. Watch for Neil Jordan troupe member Stephen Rea, who makes a charming uncredited cameo. (Ireland, 2008, 76m&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;8:30 pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Telluride by the Sea: I've Loved You So Long&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving two of the most memorable performances of the year, Kristin Scott Thomas (A Handful Of Dust, Four Weddings And A Funeral, The English Patient) and Elsa Zylberstein (Mina Tannenbaum, Time Regained) turn novelist Philippe Claudel’s quintessentially French drama into one of the most exciting acting showcases in years. Juliette (Scott Thomas) is a hardened, withdrawn ex-convict who is freed from prison after serving 15 years for committing a horrible crime. She moves in with her happily married sister Lea (Zylberstein), a bourgeois academic who simultaneously fears and adores her. Juliette’s adjustment to her provincial hometown is at first exacerbated by her chilly silence, sudden bursts of anger and bitter dignity. Slowly, however, the deliberate rhythms of family life rekindle Juliette’s desire for normalcy. Filled with suspense, Claudel’s film, winner of two awards at Berlin, remains surprising until its finale.
