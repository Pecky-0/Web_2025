0.07 mi 2 min +9 ft This heavily used trail runs from the Kancamagus Highway, to the &lt;br /&gt;

Piper Trail in the flat saddle between Chocorua and the Three &lt;br /&gt;

Sisters. Champney Falls is attractive, particularly when there is a &lt;br /&gt;

good flow of water, and the trail has moderate grades all the way. &lt;br /&gt;

Leaving the parking area, the trail soon crosses Twin Brook on &lt;br /&gt;

rocks (the footbridge here was severely damaged by a flood in &lt;br /&gt;

March 2011 and is unsafe to use), turns right, passes the junction, &lt;br /&gt;

where the Bolles Trail diverges right, and proceeds south with &lt;br /&gt;

easy grades, mostly on an old logging road, to Champney Brook. &lt;br /&gt;

Falls, climbing steeply near the falls. Caution: Many of the ledges &lt;br /&gt;

in the area around the falls are very slippery; there have been &lt;br /&gt;

many serious accidents in this vicinity. The main trail passes a &lt;br /&gt;

restricted outlook to the north, and the loop path rejoins. &lt;br /&gt;
