Cost is $5 for members, $8 non-members. It is from 6pm-9pm. The galleries are open to view the art along with the live music, cash bar, and a cheese/fruit table. The band playing is: Honky Tonk Knights. &lt;a href="http://www.newportartmuseum.org/pages/fourthfridays.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newportart...&lt;/a&gt; I've been to another one of these events and it was very nice - the band plays on the stair landing filling the museum with music, the food is in one area (quite the spread, too!), the bar in another room, and the exhibits throughout the museum. You can wear jeans or dress up a little if you want. Its fun to do with friends or meet new ones. Come out for some live music and art!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonia</member_name><member_id>10930360</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322404539000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320954118000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4th Fridays at Newport Arts Museum with Live Music</name><id>40718952</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322262000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/40718952/</event_url></item>
