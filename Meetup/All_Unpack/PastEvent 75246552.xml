This time of Year, it is Beautiful, with everything so Green &amp;amp; Vibrant.  The path is relatively flat, with just one  incline.  The total ride is 22 miles, but I start in the middle, so you can go less, if  you need too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I Ride Bike Paths, I usually split into several Groups.  This allows everyone to go at a speed they are comfortable with.  I plan to head right, since we usually head left, &amp;amp;  some of you may have not done this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tourism Center,  is open till I believe 10 pm. in the Summer Months.   There are Clean  Restrooms &amp;amp; a State Police Sub Station.  Those with Outstanding Warrants, may want to Alter your Appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to head for Ice Cream or Food, after the Ride.  There are plenty of places, at the next exit.  Any suggestions ??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions:  The Tourist Center is only Accessible from Route 295 North.  It is Located between  exits 9 &amp;amp; 10 on Route 295 North.  from the Worcester Area,   146 South to Route 295 North.  The  Tourist Stop, is just ahead about 1 mile or so.  From the East Bay, 195 West, 95 North, 146 North, Route 295 North&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from  the North, I would go 295 South, I would get off at Route 146 &amp;amp; get on 295 North. ( Not exactly sure how that works, but i know it is doable. Sounds like the last words of Johnny Knoxville or Steve O.  ).   The Tourist Center is just ahead about 1 Mile.&lt;/p&gt;
