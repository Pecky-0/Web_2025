<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be a walk along an old railroad line that has been converted into a trail.  From the 1870’s to the early 1900’s the Airline was a route for passenger trains from New York to Boston that was as straight as a line drawn through the air.  As many as 7 passenger trains, including the Ghost Train, went through daily.  The towns of East Hampton, Colchester, and Hebron have built a wonderful stone dust path to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 miles on the level.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  Rain cancels.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.  The sides of the trail are very steep in sections, so watch out for the youngsters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  409 Bull Hill Rd, Colchester, CT.  The parking lot is at the hairpin turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=&amp;amp;daddr=Bull+Hill+Rd&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=Fa49egIdWZuu-w&amp;amp;mra=mr&amp;amp;sll=41.723668,-72.593536&amp;amp;sspn=0.169121,0.54657&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.566591,-72.442346&amp;amp;spn=0.010596,0.034161&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245683453000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244065834000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Airline Trail Walk, Colchester CT</name><id>10569467</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245506400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/10569467/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/e/global_2859934.jpeg</photo_url></item>
