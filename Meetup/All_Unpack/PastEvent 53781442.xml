These are promises made to ourselves but heard by others. There is a strength in telling other people what you intend to do.&amp;nbsp;Of course you don't have to commit to anything. Come to share your situation with others who understand (all too well). Get advice from people who've been in your shoes. And, if you think it might help, find a clutter buddy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have a sign saying Metrowest P &amp; C at the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alice</member_name><member_id>7648322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331858396000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Procrastinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Metrowest-Procrastinators-and-Clutterers</urlname><id>1357989</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>Metrowest Procrastinators and Clutterers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330194229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Make commitments and meet them, with a little help from our friends</name><id>53781442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1331852400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Metrowest-Procrastinators-and-Clutterers/events/53781442/</event_url></item>
