When you become more aware that you DO know how to manifest what you want and how you do it, it will build your belief in positive ways and allow even more success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us in celebrating the magnificent creators that we are!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much to those of you who have RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and showed up! PLEASE, PLEASE, only sign up if you really intend to show up. We set up our space, and prepare snacks and handouts accordingly. Also, we can only take a maximum of 20 people in our space, and do not want to exclude anyone unnecessarily because of a no-show. Help us reach our goal of 100% attendance for those who rsvp &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun! Please join us and stay &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; by participating in our community's message board discussions and receiving our e-mails (which will include our &amp;quot;Good Vibrations&amp;quot; tips and news). To be able to do so, go to your account, and under &amp;quot;Your Groups&amp;quot;, each one has an &amp;quot;Edit email settings&amp;quot;. Set your preferences there. Hope to hear from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;I continue to be blown away by what happens to me when I come here.  Between the guided meditations and learning processes to address my own personal negative thoughts and behaviors, I am feeling so much stronger than before I was blessed to find you.  Thank you!&amp;quot;  Cheryl Bailey&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6516126</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292446814000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288469515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Yes I Can!"</name><id>fvzspynqbcc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292371200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/15496371/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/4/global_5412564.jpeg</photo_url></item>
