(who doesn't - and all the many different kinds are equally delicious!).  How about watching fierce athletic competition between creative and driven people who share our passion for all things China?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe you just don't want to miss a chance to get out and about on a lazy June Sunday when you know there will be a LOT of other foods around to sample that go beyond Zhong Zi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your motivation, I hope you might consider joining us for awhile on the banks of the Charles to cheer on some people that have done a lot over the years to bring some of China to New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEETUP TIME:&lt;/b&gt;  We could plan to meet at 12:00 noon - as you review the website, you'll notice that the races continue onward until 5:00 p.m.  If there is a desire to meet earlier, please send your organizer a note.&lt;br /&gt;******************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an excerpt from the official website to help you get a quick glimpse into the history of this thing we read about called Dragon Boating, courtesy of &lt;b&gt;www.bostondragonboat.org:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditionally held on the fifth day of the fifth moon on the lunar calendar -- late May to mid June on the solar calendar (June 27th for 2009) -- the Dragon Boat Festival commemorates the life and death of the ancient patriot-poet Qu Yuan who lived from 340-278 B.C. Qu Yuan was a minister who advocated reforms in his home state of Chu. The King refused to listen to Qu Yuan's advice and instead banished him from the state of Chu. In exile, Qu Yuan wrote poetry expressing his concern for his country and people. In 278, when Qu Yuan heard that his home had been invaded, he drowned himself in the Mi Lo River.  The people of Chu rushed to the river to rescue him. Too late to save Qu Yuan, they splashed furiously and threw zung-ze, steamed rice wrapped in reed leaf, into the river as a sacrifice to his spirit and to keep the fish from Qu Yuan's body.  Since that time, some 2,000 years ago, dragon boats are raced on rivers in China and people throw zung-ze into the river to honor the memory of Qu Yuan.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>ARTS &amp; CRAFTS stand  - see "A" on the site map.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245421689000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243867367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dragon Boat Festival, Charles River    </name><id>10543477</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244390400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/10543477/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/7/global_8958647.jpeg</photo_url></item>
