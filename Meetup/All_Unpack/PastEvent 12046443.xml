The plan from now on is to have these every two weeks, same time, same location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent Meetups have lasted 2-3 hours, with some folks staying for two games, and some folks leaving after just one. Turnout has ranged from 6-20! Skill and experience has ranged too, from novice players to tournament players. One thing has stayed the same, and that's everyone's fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a board if you have one, but you are welcome to come even if you don't have one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good resource for new players is the Cross Tables &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.cross-tables.com/download/CHEAT_PRO.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;--a list of two letter and other highly playable words. Look it over if you like, but you don't need to to have fun playing. I do suggest memorizing the two letter words as they will help you a lot in finding a place to play your words. You'll learn a lot of the other words through practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple notes on the space: Au Bon Pain has been very accommodating of us. They let me know that for the next few weeks-until January--they're going to be busier than normal on Sundays, as they have a flu clinic upstairs in the same building. It's worked out great so far, but just a reminder that we should try to stay in one corner of the restaurant, and try not to move furniture around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the dollar is voluntary--it goes to cover Meetup's monthly fees, and nobody will be turned away for not having funds. I ask that you bring a dollar once a month, which will cover you for the whole month even if you come to more than one game. Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Quinten</member_name><member_id>9980941</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261501979000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Word Freaks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston</urlname><id>1385528</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Scrabble Enthusiasts of (Greater) Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260307994000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre-Christmas Scrabble meetup!</name><id>12046443</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261328400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston/events/12046443/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/e/global_7376798.jpeg</photo_url></item>
