We are going to hold our very first photography critique....Tom Walker will be our gracious host... And we are limiting the number of folks who can attend to 10 people. That way we can spend time on each persons work. Here is the idea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring any photo work, in any stage of completion, for a roundtable critique! We encourage members of ALL skill levels to attend this monthly opportunity to: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- obtain specific critiques of your own work &lt;br /&gt;- help develop other artist's skills &lt;br /&gt;- increase your art vocabulary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work brought for critique can be in-process or completed, but a limit of two per photographer is requested.  A collection of photos for the same portfolio will be considered one work. We expect these sessions to be highly educational and encouraging, but please be prepared to have presented work--respectfully--dissected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scotty&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193958690000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191956364000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Roundtable Critique</name><id>6519102</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193785200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/6519102/</event_url></item>
