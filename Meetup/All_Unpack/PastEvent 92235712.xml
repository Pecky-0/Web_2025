If it's a holiday sweater that's great, but any ugly sweater will do. We're going to start-off at Orleans Bar &amp;amp; Restaurant on Holland Street, just outside Davis Square. We'll toss back a beverage or two, and then trek on down into Davis Square, stopping at as many places as we can handle including, but not limited to: The Burren, Foundry, Saloon, Sligo Pub, Joshua Tree, and Five Horses. I suspect we will probably grab some food along the way as well. You are welcome to join us for one drink or for the whole trip, whatever suits your schedule. There might even be small prizes for the ugliest sweater and for the last Jumbo standing. If you have any questions or suggestions, shoot me an email at rich.kelley@tufts.edu.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355234749000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353456963000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jumbo Ugly Sweater Pub Crawl</name><id>92235712</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354918500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/92235712/</event_url></item>
