&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000FF"&gt;Market Talk by Harlan Rieur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Harlan gives us his live market analysis on market trends. Using StockCharts.com and his own combination of indicators - Bollinger Bands, stochastic RSI, MACD, Williams%, OBV plus his 13/34 moving averages.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; font-size : small"&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quantifiable Edges Buying Power Index - Rob Hanna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rob Hanna of QuantifiableEdges.com has&amp;nbsp;developed some new tools that are proving invaluable. Rob will be discussing them in detailfor us. .&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;*Do you look to overbought and oversold measures to tell you when the market is likely to reverse? &lt;br /&gt;

*Have traditional filters like volume, breadth, and momentum been insufficient in recent years to determine whether a move is likely to persist? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Since 2008 it would have been very difficult making money with many traditional overbought/oversold techniques. Buying power has become a more prevalent factor and needs to be considered. Buying power helps determine the ability of a move to persist or reverse strongly. Quantifiable Edges computes a QE Buying Power Index which has been useful in identifying opportunities both short and intermediate-term.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;span&gt;In this talk, Rob will&amp;nbsp;discuss how to compute the QE Buying Power Index. He&amp;rsquo;ll also explain the concepts behind the index, giving traders the ability to further research these ideas on their own. Lastly, he will share a simple swing trading system that would have produced strong results both long and short over the last 4 years using the QE Buying Power Index. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our members value discussion highly. We try to pack as much discussion as possible. Expressing ideas and sharing knowledge is paramount to our members. &lt;br /&gt;

All levels of expertise are welcome. No question is too simple - as a matter of fact the simplest question often evokes the best discussion! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;If you talk stocks with someone then bring them with you!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
