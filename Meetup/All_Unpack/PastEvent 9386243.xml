<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Campaign for Liberty 5th Congressional District Meetup - Middlebury, CT&lt;br /&gt;(5th District is Danbury, Waterbury to Meriden, to Newington, New Britain, west of Hartford, and the Northwest corner of CT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come meet your fellow 5th district C4L members!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 1/24/09 at 2 pm, we'll be at Maples Restaurant in Middlebury, CT. Maples is an inexpensive restaurant - come join us for a drink or a snack if you like. This location seems to be relatively fair for those who have said they would attend. We'll keep this informal, as it is our initial meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts on the &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Meet and greet&lt;br /&gt;2) Discuss 5th district and state-wide issues.&lt;br /&gt;3) What can we do to gain exposure in our community?&lt;br /&gt;4) How to go about recruiting Liberty-minded folks.&lt;br /&gt;5) What tools do we need to grow in Connecticut? ideas?&lt;br /&gt;6) Connecticut 2010 election cycle priorities (Chris Dodd is up for reelection, Chris Murphy, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;7) The Connecticut focused pro-liberty website (under construction currently).&lt;br /&gt;8) Misc. (other issues that come up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those not in the 5th District:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to attend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm talking to a few other C4L folks in CT about having a statewide meeting. I hope this could be in March or April. (Jim Azzola supports this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agenda for this statewide meeting would be more &amp;quot;set in stone,&amp;quot; and I would like to arrange some speakers, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to work with us to plan this, please contact me ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Sica&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be conspicuously thin.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233104921000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230177323000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Campaign for Liberty 5th Congressional District Meetup - Middlebury, CT</name><id>9386243</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232823600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/9386243/</event_url></item>
