The food at Estragon will recreate a slice of sunny Madrid - perfect to warm up a cold Boston evening.  The staff will also demonstrate Spanish culture as part of the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP at &lt;a href="http://culturalcafefebruary.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://culturalcafefe...&lt;/a&gt; by January 27th for this affordable and fun event.

The setting is informal as we gather to build community, share a delicious meal, learn a bit about Spanish culture, and support a great cause.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the large group table.
