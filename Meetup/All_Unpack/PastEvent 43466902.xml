Durty Nelly's is a small "neighborhoody" irish pub in the heart of the Haymarket. They have three TVs and Greg, our barkeep du jour, will be on the grill/fryer if you happen to get hungry. The outdoor produce market will also be going on so if you need those last minute items for Christmas dinner, you can get your shopping done then! I should be there by noon or so. Don your jersey and your yuletide cheer and come on down! Hope to see you there! This event is cross-listed with Boston Happy Hour and Social Fun. You are responsible for your own food/drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO. DON'T FORGET TO TIP YOUR BARTENDER!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324750989000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323113000000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Patriots Holiday Viewing Party - Pats vs. Dolphins at Durty Nelly's Pub</name><id>43466902</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324746000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/43466902/</event_url></item>
