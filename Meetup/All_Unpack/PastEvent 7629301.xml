It would be pretty hard to miss me, I should have a table top meet-up sign. I can provide my cell phone number on request to any meetup member who are planning to attend.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg D</member_name><member_id>4879355</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210249291000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Please come see this Free Show and enjoy the Unique blend of varied music styles and talented musicians that make up the great Music of Stretch.
