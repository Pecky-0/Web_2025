&lt;p&gt;There are about 20 people signed up so far from various groups.&amp;nbsp; Try to join us- it will be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go for a scenic walk on a beautiful autumn day, meet us at 1:30&amp;nbsp; in the parking area on Wallace Rd (follow the brown signs) to&amp;nbsp;Westville Recreation Area.&amp;nbsp; It's a 1.8 mile easy walk.&amp;nbsp; Wallace Rd is off of Breakneck Rd which is off of South St.&amp;nbsp; Funrther down South St is the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very friendly group of German speakers will be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been invited by the West Hartford, CT German Meetup to join them and other German groups&amp;nbsp;for a Multi-group Meetup.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

Spaziergang on the Greenway by the river starting at 1:30 p.m., following by Happy Hour and late lunch/early dinner at the Vienna Restaurant in Southbridge, MA starting at 3:00 p.m. I checked out their web-site (&lt;a href="http://www.thevienna.com/WelcomeViennaHomepage.htm" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.thevienna.com/WelcomeViennaHomepage.htm&lt;/a&gt;) and they have a great selection of German and Austrian Foods. Everything sounds really yummy!&amp;nbsp; Many people rave about this restaurant.&amp;nbsp; It is in an old, historic Inn with fireplaces in each dining room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I will be traveling on Oct. 16th and won't be able to join you guys, but I am sure the West Hartford group will welcome you and take good care of you if you decide to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - viel Spass und guten Hunger!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
