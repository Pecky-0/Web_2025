If you do not already have reservations &lt;u&gt;with the theater&lt;/u&gt;, please update your RSVP accordingly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this Meet-up we will return to the 2nd Story Theater in Warren, RI for &amp;quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&amp;quot;. Here is the description on 2nd Story's website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harper Leeâ€™s coming-of-age classic remains one of the most beloved and influential stories of our time. The adventures of Scout, Jem and Atticus Finch are at once an epic saga brimming with stark lessons of tolerance and quiet heroism, and a simple story of love, hope and family. Imaginatively dramatized by Christopher Sergel, To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect way for your family to celebrate the spirit of the holidays. &lt;b&gt;Reserve soon for this one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ticket Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $10. Seating is General Admission.  (This is a preview night, so tickets are discounted.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each person is responsible for purchasing their own ticket.&lt;/b&gt; For reservations, please call the 2nd Story Theater at 401-247-4200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Note that Friday nights at 2nd Story do sell out early.  Please do not wait to order your tickets!  This is a very popular show and will sell out quickly.  I strongly recommend that you order your tickets now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are interested, we will meet for dinner before the play.  The Cafe, conveniently located on the first floor of the theater, is open for this performance.  Therefore, we'll give that a try.  The menu is light, but tasty.  Here's a link to their menu:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.2ndstorytheater.com/downstairs.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.2ndstoryth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that will be attending dinner, reservations will be made for 6:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of dinner will be handled as follows:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinks will be consigned to a separate check from the meal.  Each person will add 30% to the price of their drink to cover the 8% RI Tax plus an 18% tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meal will be on one check.  An 18% tip will be added to the total and meal check will be divided evenly by the number of people attending the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send an e-mail including my cell phone number to all who RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. If you will not make it to the restaurant by 6:00 PM please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner is optional and is not included in the price of the ticket.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet-up Logistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fairly large parking lot located next to the theater between Market Street and Route 114 in Warren. A sign for Second Story Theater is on Route 114, although it's somewhat hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be just inside the theater's main entrance at 7:30 and will be holding a small MEET-UP sign. Seating is first-come;first-served, so please be prompt so we can all sit together. When you RSVP, I will provide my cell phone number in case you're running late or get lost.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside front entrance holding MEET-UP Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Correia</member_name><member_id>8033800</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258763876000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253030711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>To Kill a Mockingbird</name><id>11378220</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258158600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/11378220/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/global_6290483.jpeg</photo_url></item>
