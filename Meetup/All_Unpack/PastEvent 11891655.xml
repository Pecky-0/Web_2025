It's just what you need to start your week off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relax, be social over good food, drinks and conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and join me for cocktails @ Pops this very cool and trendy local in the heart of the South End. The decor is striking, as if you stepped back in time, let's say... the 1920s/1930s. The service has an outstanding reputation for being quick and professional, and the food - Delicious and innovative, as well as classic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's step back in time for a brief moment @ this classically designed neighborhood haunt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can Checkout their website. It Looks Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popsrestaurant.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.popsrestau...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Things, Small Packages&lt;br /&gt;Tom Sietsema&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three cozy restaurants deliver abundant flavor in Boston. By Tom Sietsema&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love a big, show-stopping dining extravaganza in the heart of a city as much as the next guy. But just as often in my travels, I like to seek out places that swell with locals and lend subtle flavor to their neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are three such restaurants, from a recent taste-test of the Boston area. Each offers a delicious experience; the common denominator is memorable cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felino Samson had two goals in mind when he opened Pops in Boston's South End in February. Given the rush of everyday life, the Philippines native hoped to serve food that was &amp;quot;constant and comforting&amp;quot; to his guests. He also aimed to democratize the restaurant experience. &amp;quot;Good food shouldn't be exclusive to fine dining,&amp;quot; says the fashion designer-turned-chef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mission accomplished. The dinner menu at Pops roams the world for inspiration-there's duck confit from France, an Asian-style salmon and an all-American cheeseburger, among other detours-and no entrï¿½Â©e costs more than $20. Samson nods to nearby Rhode Island with &amp;quot;stuffies&amp;quot; (shells heaped with chopped baked clams, house-made sausage, toasted corn and herbed breadcrumbs) and looks to Italy with wild mushroom and taro risotto with white truffle oil. There are chicken wings, too, bundled in a bamboo leaf and ignited with a glaze of chilies and garlic. Once you've sampled one wing, it's hard to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold-and-black wallpaper and black-and-white-striped chairs give Pops the air of an intimate supper club; an etched glass window lets diners seated at the counter watch Samson and crew dance around one another in his tiny kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story behind the name? &amp;quot;It's one syllable and it's easy to remember,&amp;quot; explains the chef, who adds that pop! is also the soothing sound made when a cork is eased from a bottle of champagne...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260490167000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258426854000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cocktails &amp; Early Dinner @ Pops Restaurant  - Step Back in Time for An Evening </name><id>11891655</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260138600000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11891655/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/8/a/global_11860746.jpeg</photo_url></item>
