Is weeknight a better day? I am flexible. Two options: Sat, Jan 2, 3:50pm showing or the following week, Wed, Jan 6th, at 6:50pm. &lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to this! &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262665379000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260186769000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nine</name><id>12034773</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262464200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/12034773/</event_url></item>
