<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing a new feature of Boston Area Philosophy Discussions: the &amp;quot;Impromptu Philosophizer&amp;quot; (IP)&lt;/b&gt;.  These casual meetings at cafes or pubs may or may not have a specific topic, and will typically be offered on Monday nights but can occur at other times as well.  But you’ll need to check back often because some IPs may be scheduled “on the spur of the moment!” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn't it be great to know that there is a way for philosophically minded people to meet but with no particular agenda other than that of satisfying the need to talk about what's on your mind?  Whether the interest or concern involves current events or politics, cultural or intellectual issues, personal stuff or whatever else is on your mind we can all benefit from sharing philosophical perspectives.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred or I will announce IP meetups as they materialize from the flow of our respective schedules, but also please feel free to let either of us know if you have a hankering for an IP because we just might be able to accommodate your need to philosophize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Therapy for the sane,&amp;quot; a term used by Gerd Achenbach (founder of the modern &lt;a href="http://www.integralhypnosis.com/philosophical_counseling.htm" target="_blank"&gt;philosophical counseling&lt;/a&gt; movement), may partially suggest the Impromptu Philosophizer concept but it will be more multifaceted than an occasional &amp;quot;therapy&amp;quot; session after a trying day.  IPs will be designed to be fun, engaging and unique opportunities for creating a near spontaneous venue to meet other group members for the purpose of sharing thoughts, ideas and concerns from a philosophical perspective.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impromptu Philosophizers are spontaneous, existentially driven meetings and discussions.  Of course, the regularly scheduled topical meetings of Boston Area Philosophy Discussions will continue to unfold!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPECIAL NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;  By their very nature, Impromptu Philosophizers may often have small turnouts. Accordingly, in order to prevent situtations in which the event host arrives and there is no one else who shows up, those who 'Yes&amp;quot; RSVP wll be asked to email a further confirmation. A confirmation count of zero will, of course, result in the cancellation of the IP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy in the picture (Look for the Meetup sign).  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279055576000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277327204000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Impromptu Philosophizer (IP)</name><id>13890644</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278975600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/events/13890644/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/a/global_15047834.jpeg</photo_url></item>
