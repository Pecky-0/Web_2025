Many of us know what we need but aren&amp;#146;t sure what we have to offer.

You might never need to rake leaves again!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329183479000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327146624000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discussion: Bartering</name><id>49003382</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329178500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/49003382/</event_url></item>
