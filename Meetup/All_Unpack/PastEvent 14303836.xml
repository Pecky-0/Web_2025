One artist plays off another's inspiration, and some magical stuff can happen.  We're hoping to make this a relaxed, enjoyable and informal time, an opportunity at the end of your week to get together with friends, and play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us at the Studio in Holliston Friday evening, anytime from 4:30 pm onward;  wear (bring!) your comfy pajamas, or other comfiest clothes, and join us for an evening of art and laughter...you can try out some new techniques for making art backgrounds and use them for art jam cards or collage;  you can play with cards from the &amp;quot;jam&amp;quot; jars, or you may want to work on whatever your current project may be...it's all good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we are asking a $10.00 fee from non-studio members to help defray our operating costs.  There is plenty of parking, lots of table space, and materials to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be snacks to share,  tea and soft drinks, spring water and wine (aka art juice):   bring whatever you'd like to add to the feast.  Fuzzy slippers, stuffed animals, quilts and pillows are welcome, but not required.  Comfort and creativity are the key words!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>emelengy</member_name><member_id>4250560</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsi</member_name><member_id>5074581</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282408021000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280846834000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Studio Friday:  the 'Jammie Jam</name><id>14303836</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282336200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/14303836/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/e/global_17161934.jpeg</photo_url></item>
