From gaseous clouds to stars, elements, molecules, life, intelligence, and finally, humans, there is now an unprecedented ability to know that we know. The development of the human mind is most incredible, but is there more than physiology? Evolution often occurs as the outcome of a crisis that can only be solved at a higher level of complexity. With the advent of the human mind, the next evolutionary phase reveals an even higher level of consciousness that our culture is only beginning to grasp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are intrigued by the vast potential of human consciousness, please join Charles Silverstein for an evening dedicated to exploring the evolution of humanity in the face of current world problems.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Silverstein is dedicated to pursuing his deep interest in personal transformation, alternative healing, and the relationship between science and spirituality. Currently a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Integral Studies, his research focuses on conscious evolution and personal growth. Charles holds a Master of Arts in &lt;a href="http://www.learn.edu/programs/Conscious%20Evolution/" target="_blank"&gt;Conscious Evolution from The Graduate Institute&lt;/a&gt; and offers workshops on consciousness-based healing, leads group meditations, and practices Sundo Taoist Yoga. He had a 20-year career as a financial analyst and portfolio manager, and was an educator in the fields of science and mathematics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;Tuesday, March 9, 2010&lt;br /&gt;7:00 â€“ 8:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;Cost: FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Growing Green Wellness Center&lt;br /&gt;197 New Britain Avenue&lt;br /&gt;Hartford, CT 06106&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact imani@thegreenvibration.com or 860.983.5276 for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268500699000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266257159000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Evolution: Living an Awakened Life </name><id>12609549</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268179200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/12609549/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/2/global_12433362.jpeg</photo_url></item>
