&lt;p&gt;Your Organizer,&lt;br&gt;

 Donna (msdondon2003@yahoo.com)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not sure you want to join A Circle of Friends? Would you like to attend an event before joining? Feel free to contact me and I will be more than happy to have you attend as a guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Wondering what the yearly dues are for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 In order to have a group on Meetup, the organizer has to pay a monthly site fee. The dues help to defray the cost of this for the organizers. Any excess money collected will be used toward defraying the cost of future events for all paying members.  The membership fee is non refundable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.81</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1238368613000</created><lat>42.8100013733</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>264</id><urlkey>friends</urlkey><name>Friends</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>498</id><urlkey>singles</urlkey><name>Singles</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1091</id><urlkey>newlysingle</urlkey><name>Newly Single</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1273</id><urlkey>newintown</urlkey><name>New In Town</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1570</id><urlkey>divorcesupport</urlkey><name>Divorce Support</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4422</id><urlkey>socialnetwork</urlkey><name>Social Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10581</id><urlkey>social</urlkey><name>Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15117</id><urlkey>fun-times</urlkey><name>Fun Times</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16687</id><urlkey>newly-divorced</urlkey><name>Newly Divorced</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17866</id><urlkey>meeting-new-people</urlkey><name>Meeting New People</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>59433</id><urlkey>single-parties</urlkey><name>Single Parents</name></topics_item></topics><name>A Circle of Friends</name><id>1421257</id><members>268</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>2153112</member_id><name>Donna </name></organizer><urlname>A-Circle-of-Friends</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/a/8/600_144260392.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/a/8/highres_144260392.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>144260392</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/a/8/thumb_144260392.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Newburyport</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/A-Circle-of-Friends/</link><lon>-70.8799972534</lon></item>
