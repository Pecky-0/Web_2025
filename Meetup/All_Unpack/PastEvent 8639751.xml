If you miss the group on the way in, be sure to meet up with us after.  We gather just outside the auditorium we watch the film in to discuss the movie and decide where to go for drinks and munchies.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7PM is a guess for now.  I will update with more information closer to the event.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the movie is showing upstairs, look for me near the windows at the top of the escalator, next to the coffee concession stand.   If the movie is showing downstairs, I will be just inside the ropes past the ticket taker.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, I will be wearing my Boston Movie Group Badge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is called:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bangkok Dangerous &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Nicolas Cage, Shahkrit Yamnarm, Charlie Yeung, Panward Hemmanee, Nirattisai Kaljaruek, Dom Hetrakul &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Drama, Thriller &lt;br /&gt;Official Website:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bangkokdangerousmovie.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bangkokdan...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BangkokDangerousmovie.net &lt;br /&gt;Review: Not Available &lt;br /&gt;DVD Review: Not Available &lt;br /&gt;DVD: Not Available &lt;br /&gt;Movie Poster: One-Sheet | Teaser &lt;br /&gt;Production Stills: View here &lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: The life of an anonymous assassin takes an unexpected turn when he travels to Thailand to complete a series of contract killings. Joe (Nicolas Cage), a remorseless hitman, is in Bangkok to execute four enemies of a ruthless crime boss named Surat. He hires Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm), a street punk and pickpocket, to run errands for him with the intention of covering his tracks by killing him at the end of the assignment. Strangely, Joe, the ultimate lone wolf, instead finds himself mentoring the young man while simultaneously being drawn into a tentative romance with a local shop girl. As he falls further under the sway of Bangkok's intoxicating beauty, Joe begins to question his isolated existence and let down his guard... just as Surat decides it's time to clean house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directors Oxide Pang and Danny Pang (&amp;quot;The Eye&amp;quot;) paint an explosive picture of the Bangkok underworld, illuminated with neon and saturated in violence. Based on the Pang Brothers' wildly popular Hong Kong action film of the same name &amp;quot;Bangkok Dangerous&amp;quot; is written by Jason Richman.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222684154000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219934472000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bangkok Dangerous</name><id>8639751</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220653800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/8639751/</event_url></item>
