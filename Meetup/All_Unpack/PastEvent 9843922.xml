<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Allright - lets try this again.  We'll rework the rules to avoid the fiasco of the last attempt (some people signed up then never logged back on to meetup and the other half dropped within the last two days....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is for everyone to bring a homemade (or ingredients to make on site) dish that is Sicilian.  Start showing up around 6 (or earlier if you want to use my kitchen and have something that's going to take a while) and we eat around 7:00.  When you sign up please put in the dish you are bringing - if not you will be removed from the event.  Try and bring a dish that fills out a meal given what others have signed up for (ie lets shoot for a couple mains, a couple entres, a couple side dishes, and a couple desserts).  Please remember that by signing up you are making a pretty firm commitment to actually show up as the rest of the group is counting on you bringing your food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and Bon Apetit, Chris&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242064351000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><id>1354358</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235829424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sicilian night - third times the charm!!!!</name><id>9843922</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237762800000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/events/9843922/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/c/global_6879276.jpeg</photo_url></item>
