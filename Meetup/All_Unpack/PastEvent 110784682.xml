 &lt;br /&gt;

WHEN: 2 hours starting at the posted time &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

RSVP POLICY: ***NOTE THAT THIS EVENT IS SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION IF THERE ARE 3 OR FEWER ARTISTS RSVPd.  SO CHECK YOUR INBOX OR THIS CALENDAR THE DAY OF THE EVENT*** &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: If it's less than 50, pack light.  Space is tight in the Turkish cafe. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

WHERE TO MEET*: At the posted time, with 1/2 hour leeway for late-comers. Let's meet in the porch veranda of the hotel.  If there is a wedding, we can meet in the bar area. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

DIRECTIONS: Route 91N to Exit 5 (I think) Northampton Center. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
