<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;QK in the sand for this A/AA coed reverse queen/king-of-the-beach doubles tournament. May sign up as an individual. Different partner each round. No reffing. No sitting. Play every round. Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a friendship tournament format, meaning call your own faults, as there are no referees. &lt;span&gt;Top players after pool play will compete in a playoff format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers for these events are Matt BenDaniel and Brian Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the ruleset listed in the first post on the following: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/messages/boards/thread/8548572?thread=8548572" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/messages/boards/thread/8548572?thread=8548572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We understand that not everyone has a car. The tournament organizer can help you get a carpool ride to/from the event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/strong&gt;: The 8:30 a.m. MBTA Newburyport/Rockport Commuter Train from North Station to Lynn Station is only a 19-minute ride, then a 6-block (15 minute) walk to Nahant Beach. MBTA buses which go there include: 439, 441, 442, 448, 449, 426, 429, 431, 435, 436, 455, and 456. Use&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/"&gt;http://maps.google.com&lt;/a&gt; click on "Get directions" and "By public transit" and travel to "Lynn Commuter Rail". The location for directions to is "42.455619,-70.93634". Easy search: Click on the following link and change the starting location (A)  &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/GN2zn"&gt;http://goo.gl/GN2zn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To park a car, drive south for a mile down Nahant Road (the causeway) to its south end. Turn left into the parking lot for the restaurant. On the left is a shack at the entrance. Pay $3 fee and drive until you reach the section of the beach marked "10".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are public restroom facilities at the beach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event starts at 9:00 AM and lasts into the afternoon (~2 PM). To play in this event you must commit to staying at least through the end of pool play. Remember to bring snacks/food and water/beverages, as this event will involve a significant amount of volleyball play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament directors are responsible for making sure all competitors have the required skill level. If we do not already know you, when signing up, it is your responsibility to convince us you have the skills. To sign up, email Matt using this link: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=1878223&amp;amp;subject=QK8/5" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=1878223&amp;amp;subject=QK8/5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name &lt;br /&gt;

 Gender &lt;br /&gt;

 Confirm that you have read the ruleset at the link above and that you agree to play by those rules. &lt;br /&gt;

 Confirm that you can commit to arriving before tournament start and until the end. &lt;br /&gt;

 Signup partner name (if you have a signup partner)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferably, each player in a signup pair should be registered in meetup and send an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this event we will aim to have player numbers in a multiple of four so that there are no sitouts for players. Preference is given to AA/A players who sign up in male/female pairs, although some single signups will be allowed. Note that sending an email does not guarantee a spot to play; spots are only guaranteed if you are assigned a Yes RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We plan to set up at section #10.
