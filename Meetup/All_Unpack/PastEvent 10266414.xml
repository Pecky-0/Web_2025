Abe Lincoln stayed in this mansion, and it has a lot of history.  The meetup will start at 7 pm.  There is going to be a free buffet, 2 dollar beers, and 3 dollar mixed drinks.  Their will also be a tour of the place during the band breaks for us.  If you need directions, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=89+sherland+ave+new+haven+ct&amp;amp;sll=37.09024,-95.712891&amp;amp;sspn=48.77566,78.75&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank"&gt;CLICK HERE.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be an atmosphere to talk, meet new people, and see some history, along with some good tunes from the house band, Robbie G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/478650/Mansion.pdf"&gt;Here is the local map to get there and which mansion it is.  I recommend printing this out.&lt;/a&gt;  Notice the entrance is really on Clifton Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to shoot for from 30 to 100 or more people showing up, so we could take advantage of the specials.  I will give them a final count friday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get lost, please call Steve for info....203-987-8168.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve C.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be meeting up in the Bar Area.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1242065445000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
