Tell all your friends! We will hike at a moderate pace and wait at certain points along the trail. It sounded like folks would have liked to hike for a bit longer. We can start at the South side of the Skyline Trail, hike up to Elliot Tower, take the Red Dot Trail, then back down to the Headquarters on the North Side of the Skyline Trail. If people prefer we take the same route as the last time (North side first then down the South side) let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;START TIME/LOCATION: 12 noon - Houghton's Pond, Milton, Ma, address listed is for the Headquarters which is a 100 feet from the Houghton's Pond parking. There is more parking available at the Houghton's Pond parking area (I will be parked here). &lt;br /&gt;
