You MUST be a current EAA member to fly. www.EAA.org is the site to join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll need a good ground crew as well. &lt;br /&gt;June 14th is International Young Eagles Day. Over a 1,379,615 Young Eagles have flown as of this writing. You can learn more at  &lt;a href="http://www.youngeagles.org" target="_blank"&gt;Young Eagles web site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll try to get newspapers and radio there. We've been talking about this for a long time. &lt;br /&gt;We can work out the details at our next couple meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are involved with Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, schools or any other organization that has kids between 8 and 17 years old, please invite them.
