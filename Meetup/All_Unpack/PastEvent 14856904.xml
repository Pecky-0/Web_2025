While this event is not sponsored by the City of Boston, the City Counci,l and the Mayor usually send resolutions that are read at this event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  We need to have a peaceful presence at this event telling the communists, their corporate allies, and politicians that get financial support from the Chinese Communists by keeping their mouths shut that there are plenty of freedom loving Americans still living in the Boston area.  &lt;br /&gt;We also need to be there to let people in the Chinese Community who are harassed, and beated by communists thugs that they have plenty of allies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you can make it, bring a sign.  I will have some handouts.  Last year, there were only four of us but hundreds of folks who passd by supported us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This event shouldn't last more than 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>harold shurtleff</member_name><member_id>3658665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285503721000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285161599000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Say No to Mayor "Maonino" and the Boston City Council</name><id>14856904</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285426800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/14856904/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/2/e/global_1505678.jpeg</photo_url></item>
