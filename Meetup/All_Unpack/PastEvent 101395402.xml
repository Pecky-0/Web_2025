&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and events in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The American at the The Locomotive Works! This is the newer place where Everyman "used" to be for those that remember.... and, yeah, that makes you an official Rhode Islander ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we were at Everyman a few Super Bowls ago and it was good. For those that thought "This is an awesome space, but it could use some sprucing up", this is for you! The folks from the Abbey opened The American last year. When we went in June it was awesome and I kept thinking, "wow, this would be great on a cold night in winter"! The reviews are in, we had a great time last June, and the beverage selection and especially the food were terrific!Â  Odds are, its going to be a cold winters night next Monday, so let's warm up with some cheer and let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
