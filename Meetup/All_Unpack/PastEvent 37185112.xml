Find more information at: www.mspca.org/adoption/pit-bull-adoption Beyond the Myth is a film about dog breeds commonly referred to as&amp;quot;pit bulls&amp;quot; and those who love these breeds. Viewers are taken on a journey to four U.S. cities where Breed Specific Legislation focusing on &amp;quot;pit bulls&amp;quot; has profoundly impacted people and animals: Denver, Miami, Cincinnati, and San Francisco. The documentary intelligently explores the contributing factors behind the public's generalized fear of &amp;quot;pit bulls&amp;quot;, and examines the conflict existing between advocates and opponents of breed discriminatory laws, commonly referred to as breed bans. It also investigates the myths associated with these breeds, challenges the idea that they are inherently vicious, presents eye-opening research regarding the media's role in influencing people's opinion on dog attacks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319339288000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318457712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd chance to see Beyond the Myth Movie Screening!
