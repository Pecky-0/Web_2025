From the event description at &lt;a href="http://www.fordhallforum.org/programs/evangelicals:" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fordhallfo...&lt;/a&gt; Although some dismiss Evangelical Christians as zealots with uncommon social politics and little regard for science, this powerful voting bloc is a force to be reckoned with in our democracy, and likely misunderstood. Dr. John C. Green, Senior Research Advisor at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, presents empirical data on what evangelicals actually believe based on surveys of clergy and parishioners. Authors of The Anointed, Dr. Karl Giberson and Dr. Randall Stephens, provide an analysis of intellectual authority within this group and examine themes ranging from Creationism to messaging. Ford Hall Forum Board member and former religion reporter for the Boston Herald Eric Convey converses with these sociological researchers to predict how Evangelical Christians&amp;#146; true values will translate into civic action. Drs. Randall Stephens and Karl Giberson will be selling and signing copies of their book, &amp;#147;The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age&amp;#148; at the end of the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320972594000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320346684000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evangelicals in the Electorate</name><id>39838182</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320967800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/39838182/</event_url></item>
