<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I will host a Mexican food night at my house if people are interested. I can host about 8-10 people comfortably. If it's nice weather, I have a big backyard perfect for eating out. I live in JP, but you don't need a resident permit to park on my street and I'm close to the Orange Line. Anyone interested?&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340331561000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><id>1354358</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270503079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mexican Night</name><id>16223651</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340319600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/events/16223651/</event_url></item>
