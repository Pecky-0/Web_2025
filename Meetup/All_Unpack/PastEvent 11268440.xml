I would love to get one of their nice round tables, where people can actually converse with the entire group. It seats eighteen people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to RSVP by Friday evening if you feel like going! :) I'll make a reservation for 18 on Friday, and will revise it Saturday at 6:00 pm with John Harvard as people sign up / drop off. Rocky Horror is a midnight show, too late for most people. I am guessing there will be people won't know until the last minute if they can go. As long as I get a firm answer by Friday for most people, and we only have a few people who need to check their schedules on Saturday if they can make it, that's fine with me! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- T.J. Maher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be waiting outside John Harvard's on the sidewalk by 9:00 pm, and will be holding up a red MEETUP sign like some type of demented chauffer. T.J. is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, and a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag. We can walk to the movie theater at 11:20 pm. The line forms to get in at 11:30 pm, I believe. Feel free to grab your ticket before John Harvard's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really don't like John Harvard's, or can only make the movie, we'll probably be at the movie theater to get in line by 11:30 pm. Feel free to drop in the very last second for the movie. It's only when I have to make dinner reservations is when it gets tricky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About John Harvards:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.johnharvards.com/menus.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.johnharva...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;At John Harvard's, you'll find our famous selection of ales and lagers, brewed fresh on the premises according to the recipes of William Shakespeare (we believe). The recipes were brought to America in 1637 by John Harvard, after whom Harvard University is named. Here you'll also find a menu of honest food, prepared from the freshest ingredients and with the same care and thoughtfulness as our beers&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.johnharvards.com/downloads/Menu-Cambridge.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.johnharva...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Mmm... the Kettle Chip nachos are delicious. Potato chips dressed up like nachos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEER:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.johnharvards.com/brews.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.johnharva...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... John Harvard's has a rotating list of beer. If you want to try them all, they have a Sampler which is five small glasses of their beers of the day.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
