So please RSVP right now, while you're thinking of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to come. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266271792000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263002385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special Makeup Meetup on Saturday 1/23</name><id>12266099</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264266000000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/12266099/</event_url></item>
