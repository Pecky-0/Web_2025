Hear the tales of the dead as your guide leads you safely through...or will she?  North Cemetery is located off North Main Street, between Loomis Drive and Fern Street.  Tickets are $15 for adults and $9 for children under 18. We’ll plan on joining the 7:00 tour.  This event is popular and reservations are recommended, so please RSVP by October 26.  For those who are interested, we may aim for dinner at one of West Hartford’s great restaurants afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hauntings is a fundraiser for the Noah Webster House museum, go to their website for more details...&lt;a href="http://www.noahwebsterhouse.org/hauntings.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.noahwebste...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Be sure to arrive before 7:00, so we can connect and be there as a group for our 7:00 reservation</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273545070000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254067872000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>West Hartford Hauntings</name><id>11478272</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256943600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/11478272/</event_url></item>
