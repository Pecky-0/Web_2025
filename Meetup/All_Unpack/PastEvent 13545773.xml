A computer cannot accomplish this task because web pages are designed to be read by people, not machines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The semantic web is a vision of information that is understandable by computers, so that they can perform more of the work involved in finding, combining and acting upon information on the web. &lt;br /&gt;The semantic web is a game-changer in how website developers will think about and structure web content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CMS's will be instrumental in creating the semantic web as they can be built to emit structured information that other sites and tools can consume. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many semantic web technologies are in place today. A (partial) semantic web is not far away. CMS's support these technologies to different degrees. This talk will give an overview of semantic web technologies focusing on those that are already or nearly in place, and a review of the capabilities/plans of several content management systems for supporting these technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Media Education Foundation Community Room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leah</member_name><member_id>2960740</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275062480000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nohowebdev</urlname><id>540457</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Northampton Web Developers/ Web Designers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274386797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The intersection of Web Design/Development, Web 3.0 &amp; Content Management Systems</name><id>13545773</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274999400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nohowebdev/events/13545773/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/2/global_7689202.jpeg</photo_url></item>
