For those of you not familiar with this park, it provides one of the most breathtaking views of the Pioneer Valley I have ever seen.  It is also one of the top 20 destinations in the USA for viewing fall folliage. The Summit House, which was formerly a hotel in the 1900's, is now a museum.  It is quaint and charming, and nice for picture taking.  All and all I find this setting to be very romantic  ;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will fashion this meetup also as a picnic.  At 12:00 p.m. we can enjoy lunch together at the picnic tables.  I will bring my famous rice and chicken.  Members may bring a picnic type food to share with the group.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286901435000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285021572000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall Folliage Spectacular</name><id>14837429</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286809200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/14837429/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
