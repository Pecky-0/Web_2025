I have never been disappointed by Ryan Gosling or Michelle Williams star power and dramatic picks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Weekend: BLUE VALENTINE&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Laura Blum will host this Sunday's Talk Cinema selection, which is the story of a Scranton, PA young married couple, played by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, struggling to make the rent. The film cuts back and forth between their present hardships, possibly ending in divorce, and their courtship as young lovers. Directed by Derek Cianfrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>9:15 am Panera Bread meet Betsey for breakfast, coffee, chat   BIAM red meetup sign visible  9:40 Coolidge for optimal seating</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsey Glaser</member_name><member_id>9513701</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292257555000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291921997000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Valentine at Talk Cinema  Dec 12 at 9:15 am</name><id>15689886</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292163300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/15689886/</event_url></item>
