This gives everyone an opportunity to come and make new friends, practice their Japanese or English, and enjoy dinner with a bunch of interesting people from around the Boston area (and overseas).  Come on by, relax, practice in either language of your choice, and enjoy being part of our growing community!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, we typically stay in the very back of the Prudential Food Court and should have little signs that say &amp;quot;meetup.com&amp;quot; as table markers (unless I forget them ... which I often do :P ).  Also, if you're interested in getting dinner, most of us go out to eat afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Please welcome Nishida Kayo (or Kayo Nishida for us native English speakers) as a new Assistant Organizer to this and many other meetup events.  Kayo brings with her many great ideas and an exciting energy that will be a huge addition to our future meetups.  She also has previous experience with a meetup group very similar to our own in the UK.  Welcome, Kayo!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189455048000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188506619000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Prudential Social Meetup</name><id>6271238</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189281600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/6271238/</event_url></item>
