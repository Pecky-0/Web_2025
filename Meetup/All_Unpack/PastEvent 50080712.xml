It is one of only 24 games inducted into Games Magazine's Hall of Fame.&amp;nbsp;Even more importantly, it's a lot of fun. Let's get together and play it! The game will start&amp;nbsp;by 6:30, and will continue until one player has conquered the entire world. For those who have played before, understand what I'm talking about, and care about such trivialities (ok, it's probably only me!): We'll use the deal-out-the-cards method to determine initial ownership of countries. If you have no clue what I'm talking about just show up and you'll be a Risk expert 10 minutes after arrival. I'll provide a couple of snacks, but please feel free to bring some chips or dips or carrot sticks or cookies or whatever to share. Just snacks. No tuna casserole or potatoes au gratin necessary! ;) And BYOB. Alcohol (or not) is fine. Oh, and please bring a dollar to go towards the meetup fees that Nina so selflessly pays so we can keep this great meetup rolling. Due to the limited number of players, please, please update your RSVP as soon as possible if you'll be unable to attend so that someone else can hopefully take your place. No-shows will be shot and/or mocked derisively at the group's discretion. My phone number is 860-372-3707. If you're gonna be late, or can't come at the last minute, USE IT. :) Guests are limited to 1 due to the small number of available slots. I'll be looking forward to our friendly battle!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330279206000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327841165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Risk at Mitch's place in Hartford</name><id>50080712</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330210800000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/50080712/</event_url></item>
