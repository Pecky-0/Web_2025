<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We've decided to have a game night each month during the winter. This helps break up the long nights and to socialize with lots of fun! It just so happens that one of our leaders (Janice) has a birthday on this date so we will celebrate her birthday too! This event will be held at Janice's condo complex clubhouse (a.k.a. the hall) in South Windsor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have already: &lt;br /&gt;* Pictionary &lt;br /&gt;* Picture Picture &lt;br /&gt;* Worst Case Scenario &lt;br /&gt;* Trivial Pursuit &lt;br /&gt;* Scene It &lt;br /&gt;* Jenga (well a knockoff version) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd like to see someone bring: &lt;br /&gt;* Bolderdash &lt;br /&gt;* Cranium &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring any other game you might think 4 - 6 people at least could play at the same time. Team games of 2 -3 would be great too. Note this is an indoor game night. We are not doing horseshoes or lawn darts! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Food&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplied already: &lt;br /&gt;* Paper and glass products &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan to bring to share: &lt;br /&gt;* Finger food &lt;br /&gt;* Snacks &lt;br /&gt;* Small entree (plan to feed 5 people!) &lt;br /&gt;* Drinks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Birthday&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;You don't have to bring a present. Janice just appreciates seeing and sharing fun with her friends! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at a hall at a condo complex in South Windsor.  The address will be sent to those who respond &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; about a few days before the event. We would appreciate donations of any amount (maybe $2?) to help offset the cost of the hall rental. Donations can be made at the event. We all hope you can attend and enjoy a warm evening with great people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Janice</member_name><member_id>3804430</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>7</waitlist_count><updated>1264265176000</updated><rating><average>4.80999994278</average><count>31</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>58</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260764156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night and Birthday Party</name><id>12079776</id><headcount>60</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263078000000</time><rsvp_limit>58</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/12079776/</event_url></item>
