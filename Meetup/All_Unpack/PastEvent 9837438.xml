<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>sorry about the duplicate message.  I just realized that I had checked evening instead of daytime.  This meetup is for the daytime!&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The North Shore Scrapbooker's Meetup is for anyone that loves to scrap or paper craft!  We welcome anyone that would like some dedicated time to work on a paper crafting project.   Beginners to advanced paper crafters welcome!  We love to share our knowledge with others that share our interest or want to learn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your current project over and join us for a fun day of scrappin' and card making.  If you are a beginner and don't have a current project, give us a call and let us know what you are intersted in working on.  Marilyn can bring ideas to help you get started either scrappin' or card making.  Marilyn has been teaching both card making and scrapbooking classes for the past 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn SanClemente&lt;br /&gt;email:  marilyn.sanclemente@comcast.net&lt;br /&gt;www.stampwithmarilyn.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;978-458-0729&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay Wallace&lt;br /&gt;email:  kayandruss@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;www.kaywallaceweddingscrapbookdesign.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;617-240-3993&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilyn SanClemente</member_name><member_id>6587761</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237905094000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Scrapbookers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Scrapbooking-Meetup</urlname><id>1391854</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9599990845</group_lon><name>North Shore Scrapbooking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235748104000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scrapping and Paper Crafting Open House</name><id>9837438</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236693600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Scrapbooking-Meetup/events/9837438/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/5/2/global_7475970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
