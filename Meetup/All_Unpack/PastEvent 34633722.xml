Did you do sing in some fabulous places? Let's get together and sing a few songs, and maybe talk about what we want to do this coming fall, winter, spring. No formal exercises, just come sing and meet. DJ Todd will be running the evening, and he is a saint of the karaoke system. I'lll get there early and grab a booth at the Wave. Karaoke starts officially at 9, get there on time or a bit earlier to choose a song and get into the rotation before it gets crowded. I look forward to hearing and seeing you!
