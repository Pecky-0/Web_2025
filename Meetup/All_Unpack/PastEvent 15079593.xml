You hadn't really thought about it? Well, fortunately, Mike stands ready to help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a wishbone is kinda shaped like a Y, right? And, also like a wishbone, there were really only two choices! Simple, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, anyway, we pulled... ah, &lt;i&gt;polled&lt;/i&gt;; you voted, and Yangtze Inn in West Bridgewater got the biggest piece of the vote. So, off we go to Asia, via West Bridgewater!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be heading to Yangtze Inn on Saturday, October 23rd at 5:30 pm. A bit of research on the Web shows that this Szechwan-style Chinese restaurant has been in business since 1957, featuring a full bar and an extensive dinner buffet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you'll join us for an evening of lively conversation, tasty food, and fruity drinks with little paper umbrellas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yangtze Inn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;266 South Main St (Route 28)&lt;br /&gt;West Bridgewater, MA 02379&lt;br /&gt;(888) 894-8210&lt;br /&gt;Website: &lt;a href="http://www.yangtzeinn.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yangtze Inn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer:&lt;/b&gt; Mike and Alison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Yes. Two per member allowed. For questions about exceptions, please contact an Event Organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price Range:&lt;/b&gt; The dinner buffet is $11.50, according to the website. The menu is not online, but prices presumably are in line with other South Shore Chinese restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Fee:&lt;/b&gt; Current Annual Members - None, Group Members - $2.00, Guests - $2.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash Only Policy:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over four years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Friday, October 22 @ 9:00 pm. Any changes made after this time may not be seen by an Event Organizer. Changes to &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; after the deadline will be considered No-Shows per our guidelines on the About Us page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; Yangtze Inn is located at the intersection of South Main St (Route 28) and Bedford St.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us in the lobby, or ask for the Meetup table!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike</member_name><member_id>3444655</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alison </member_name><member_id>9429931</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288043040000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286851201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Y Not Try Yangtze?</name><id>15079593</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287869400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/events/15079593/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/3/global_18390867.jpeg</photo_url></item>
