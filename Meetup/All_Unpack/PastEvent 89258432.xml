&lt;p&gt;From Frank: (Cathy and the Red Sox Natives will be hosting this)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invited Groups are Melody's Wakefield Weeknights, Tonya's Boston Happy Hour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a 2012 Red Sox Natives Exclusive Event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us at Scoreboard in Woburn for a Patriots Game Viewing Party to watch the the New England Patriots take on the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, November 11 in Foxboro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early at 12:30pm to get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing. This will be a mix of an informal gathering in the dining area and a smaller reserved table section. We strongly suggest that fans arrive early before game time and get a table reservation with us as Scoreboard will be very busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Time is 1:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scoreboard Manager and Natives Assistant Organizer Lauren will have a full house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no event fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay for the whole game or leave whenever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives organized weekly viewing parties last year with guests from several other invited groups attending. We had a blast with up to 80 people attending at various locations in Boston, Woburn and Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scoreboard has been one of our venues for watching Patriots, Red Sox, Bruins and Celtics games over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never been to Scoreboard it is located at 15 Middlesex Canal Park next to the Hotel and Showcase Cinema off Route 128 in Woburn. Scoreboard has over 50 high definition and plasma TVs ranging in size from 50 to 92 inches. Parking is free. More info at &lt;a href="http://www.tpsscoreboard.com/"&gt;http://www.tpsscoreboard.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives team.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352674414000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351643827000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Patriots Viewing Party at Scoreboard-Buffalo Bills @ Patriots Home Game</name><id>89258432</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352655000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/89258432/</event_url></item>
