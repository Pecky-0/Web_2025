&lt;p&gt;Bardo Farm is owned and operated by a group of individuals who moved to New Hampshire back in September 2007 and bought a large property with an off-the-grid house. They've started raising pigs and rabbits and raising chickens for meat and eggs. They also have a couple of goats, an ox, a rooster and his family, a duck, a barn cat, and of course, pet dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bardo Project is an evolving approach to interweaving sustainable gardening and livestock practices, self-sufficiency skills, energy conservation and production, self-discovery, and economic development as one path to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Festival will include farm, forestry, and off-the-grid workshops, live music, entertainment, dancing, family-friendly games, vendors, camping, hiking, and the famous Bardo pig roast.&lt;/p&gt;
