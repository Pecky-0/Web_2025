Admission is $7.00. If you don't have your own skates/blades, you can rent them for $3. Their website is &lt;a href="http://www.skateland.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skateland....&lt;/a&gt; Let's meet there at 8pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know many people in Boston Skating but I know lots of people who go to Skateland every Thursday night.  It's a great way to get out and skate and it's never canceled &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floor is in excellent condition and the music is great! Most people come by car but the rink is right next to the Bradford commuter rail station (and just across the river from the Haverhill station) so you could take the train from Boston if you want.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John H</member_name><member_id>10366597</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281659114000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277262023000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adult night at Skateland in Bradford</name><id>13882992</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278028800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/13882992/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/8/global_1713624.jpeg</photo_url></item>
