As you know, Mercer Mayer is famous for his &amp;quot;Little Critters&amp;quot; characters.  How nice to be on their list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Little Critter: Just a Little Music&amp;quot; tells the simple and engaging story of Little Critter and his beloved drum.  He plays his instrument all over the house making music wherever he goes  Little Critter knows that before he can make it big as a rock star, he must practice, practice, practice!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for this &amp;quot;book launch&amp;quot; and bring your &amp;quot;lunch&amp;quot; with you!  We will read this brand new book aloud and learn some related Little Critters music. The book will come alive as we use our own drums and instruments to play at key places in the story!  And, we will make our own small drums to take home with us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will last an hour or so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am working on getting discounted copies of the book for you, or at least coupons for a local book store.  No promises, but I'll try my best!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula Penna</member_name><member_id>8325760</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274982084000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1316784</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Greater Hartford Area  Parents Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272334326000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Book Launch and Lunch!
