As a psychic medium, Isabeau will bring her direct experiences with the other side to explain the process one goes through upon dying as well as the purpose of death.  And, bringing to the table a vast amount of experience in narrative therapy, Joel will share counter cultural ideas of what aspects of death he feels are important to recognize and embrace in addition to how people emotionally process the loss of a loved one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A question and answer session will follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Glenn Wixson holds a doctorate in clinical psychology, a masters in substance abuse counseling and is a certified addiction specialist.  He is the co-founder of The Living Way, center for organic learning, has a private practice in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and is on the faculty of Leslie Universityâ€™s Division of Counseling and Psychology.  He has presented and published numerous papers on various topics including substance dependance and narrative therapy.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabeau Esby</member_name><member_id>5847842</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242866066000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240586902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lecture - Psychic and Psychological Perspectives on Death</name><id>10259114</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242428400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/10259114/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/1/global_2599441.jpeg</photo_url></item>
