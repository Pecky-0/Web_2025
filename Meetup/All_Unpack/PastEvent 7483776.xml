So if you're interested, please RSVP now (you can always change your mind later). It's almost certainly going to be at the Button Box in Wellesley again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note the later start time for this one: Noon rather than 10 a.m.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There won't be anybody there to let you in before noon, so don't show up early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini-Meetup will be low-key but with plenty of room for creativity and fun. Join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a blonde in a black or khaki apron and a name tag, or just yell, "Who's Anne?"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217186471000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204896308000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Interim Meetup</name><id>7483776</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207497600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/7483776/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/8/global_3205480.jpeg</photo_url></item>
