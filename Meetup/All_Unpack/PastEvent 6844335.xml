We're heading up for our weekly &amp;quot;Let's give HQ a hand with call-in&amp;quot; evening. Third week running now. It's easy to do and It's a lot of fun when lots of folks are doing it at once. HQ really appreciates the help with call-in. Come on up! We'll run the phones from 6:30 to 8:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a ride, contact myself (Jay) or Richard Laplante by email  and we'll arrange some carpooling.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197157255000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196643163000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>HQ Phone Banking</name><id>6844335</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196983800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6844335/</event_url></item>
