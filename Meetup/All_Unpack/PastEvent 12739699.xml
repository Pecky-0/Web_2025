But does that mean that the Maya predicted the end of the world on that date? Will time stop, the Earth stop rotating on its axis, the sun become a supernova, and will our entire solar system get sucked into a giant black hole at the center of our galaxy? Should we all be exchanging Christmas gifts early in December 2012, because none of us are going to make it to the 25th of that month? Inquiring minds want to know. Our very popular Connecticut State University archaeology professor Dr. Ken Feder will attempt to ease your concerns about 2012 because he knows the Maya didn’t predict anything particularly momentous on that date. Then again, maybe he’s part of a government cover-up to prevent widespread panic before it’s lights out for good. You decide on April 19.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with a half hour of coffee and conversation at 7:30 PM. The main talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this event and others, please read the write-up on &lt;a href="http://www.cthumanist.org/" target="_blank"&gt;our home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271893474000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267416231000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting - December 21, 2012: The End of the World As We Know It?</name><id>12739699</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271719800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/12739699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/global_5196186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
