&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Festival of Trees has been a catalyst for historic preservation in Methuen and the Merrimack Valley. It began as a fundraiser to support the restoration of the Tenney Gatehouse in Methuen, the Festival of Trees has donated more than $1,200,000 in funds to preserve our area’s historic treasures. This investment has been possible because of the generosity and creativity of those businesses, organizations, families and individuals that have made our Festival a truly magical event and due to the commitment of countless volunteers who give their time and energy to make the Festival successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This event has been a Thanksgiving weekend tradition with our groups, so let's go another year and see the beautiful trees!  There will be over 200+ decorated Christmas Trees and you can buy tickets to win on the beautiful trees.....what a concept: a tree that comes all decorated....and who knows maybe you could get lucky enough to win one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you must know before RSVPing to this event:&lt;/strong&gt; The weather outside may be cold, but inside is very warm, there is a place to hang your jacket if you bring one.  We may stay together or get separated, the trees are in an office park waiting area, it can get very crowded and lots of people. if you are not into crowds then this event may not be for you, please take that into consideration when you put your RSVP in.  The building/office park can be a little difficult to find, and parking may be difficult, give yourself a little extra time for both of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
