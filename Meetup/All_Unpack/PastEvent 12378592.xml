After trying to book several restaurants and not getting anything I decided on La Fonda Del Sol.  Since most of you weren't picky and also didn't appear to have a distaste for Spanish food, I figured this restaurant was the best bet plus it had great reviews!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: $35 Prefix Dinner Menu - Does NOT include taxes, tips or liquor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANCELLATIONS!CANCELLATIONS!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, if you are going to cancel let me know 2 days in advance!  This meetup will only have a 8 person cap!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Address: La Fonda Del Sol&lt;br /&gt;METLIFE BUILDING&lt;br /&gt;44th St and Vanderbilt Ave&lt;br /&gt;New York, NY 10166&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the 4, 5, 6 to 42nd St.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a brief bio that was given on their page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2009 Wine Spectator Restaurant Award Winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located in the MetLife Building and opened in January 2009, La Fonda Del Sol offers an unprecedented stage for modern Spanish cuisine, with a focus on tapas. Designed by Adam D. Tihany, the split-level area consists of a café/bar on the ground floor, and a dining room on the upper level for a more formal dining experience. Both areas are swanky and modernist in a mid-century &amp;quot;Mad Men&amp;quot; sort of way, perfect backdrops for the modern &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; on regional Spanish treasures being served up nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MENU:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DINNER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;appetizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salad of Blood Orange and Avocado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter Greens, Grains of Paradise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skate Wing a la Plancha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickled Peppers, Olives, Saffron Orange Sauce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soup of Chickpeas and Spanish Chorizo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tender Greens, Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow-Poached Organic Hen Egg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanish Black Beans, Crispy Pork Belly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;entrée&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roasted Cod Romesco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Olive Oil, Shaved Zucchini, Basil&lt;br /&gt;Braised Beef Cheeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Wine, Pomegranate, Celery Leaf&lt;br /&gt;Roasted Chicken&lt;br /&gt;Piquillo Peppers, Potatoes, Spinach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grilled Salmon Mole&lt;br /&gt;Parsnips, Mustard Greens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dessert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Poached Pear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turron Ice Cream&lt;br /&gt;Spiked Hot Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond Covered Marshmallows, Orange Liqueur&lt;br /&gt;Pudin de Pan (Bread Pudding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caramelized Bananas, Spice Whipped Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Executive Chef Josh DeChellis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Website: &lt;a href="http://www.patinagroup.com/restaurant.php?restaurants_id=19" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.patinagrou...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265520475000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Madams</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Multicultural-Womens-Network</urlname><id>1530786</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Multicultural Women's Network (MWN): Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264041380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Restaurant  Week at La Fonda Del Sol</name><id>12378592</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265328900000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Multicultural-Womens-Network/events/12378592/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/0/global_12722000.jpeg</photo_url></item>
