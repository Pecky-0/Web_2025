Bottle caps, buttons, Scrabble tiles and dominos will be used as the basis for our own unique artwork. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUPPLIES:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring any of the above mentioned materials that you already have &lt;i&gt;plus&lt;/i&gt; StazOn brand ink pads and alcohol inks. You might want to buy your own resin if you have lots of things you want to try...I have some resin for us to play with but probably not enough.
