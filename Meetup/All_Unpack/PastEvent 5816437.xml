So lets go outside to Quincy Quarries on Sunday June 3rd.  We will be top roping.   Lets meet at 11am.   If anyone needs a ride, email me and I can pick you up at Davis or Porter Sq at 10:15am.   We should have ropes, but bring ropes and slings if you have them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:   YOU MUST WEAR A HELMET!   If you are climbing with us (outside of the rock gym), it will be required for you to wear a helmet.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are no facilities.  Bring water, food, sunscreen, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will leave the parking lot area at 11am sharp.  If you come afterwards, you will just have to walk around and ask for the Rock Climbing Boston Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;The Quincy Quarries Reservation is part of the Blue Hills Reservation, south of Boston. Take Route 93/3 to exit 8 in Quincy. Follow signs for Quarry Hills Recreation Complex until you come to Ricciuti Drive, between a Mr. Tux and a large ?Quarry Hills? sign. It?s quick going south, but a bit roundabout going north. Turn right on Ricciuti Drive.   There is a small parking lot on your right (which is usually full and you will most likely see a line of cars on the opposite side of road where you can park).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181055765000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1180061454000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climb Quincy Quarries</name><id>5816437</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180882800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/5816437/</event_url></item>
