The room is on the second floor across from the Lounge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about the mixup but looking forward to seeing everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be talking about the recent finding of a viral connection to CFS (and probably FMS too) that has been in the news the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E-mail me if you want to present any findings or interesting information at the meeting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on Thursday, December 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260057908000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255478558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia December Meetup</name><id>nbjrfymqbfb</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259884800000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/11620901/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
