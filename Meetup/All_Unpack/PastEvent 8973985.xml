The ride is only about 1 1/2 hour from the NH/MA border.  It can easily be done as a day trip.  We will visit the Simon Pearce Glass factory and have brunch at their restaurant.  We will then head downtown Woodstock and visit the small quaint boutiques that ought to be all primed up for the Holidays.  We will leave around 9a.m. and plan on being back by 5p.m.  I'll be happy to be one of the drivers!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meeting at the rest area right before entering NH and pick up others on the way</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227391320000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224179864000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at The Mill Restaurant at the Simon Pearce Glass Factory</name><id>8973985</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226844000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/8973985/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/c/global_4915132.jpeg</photo_url></item>
