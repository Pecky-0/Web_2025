They also have other dishes - bi bim bap, sushi, etc. Unfortunately they don't take reservations, but hopefully it's not as crowded since the students aren't back yet. Well we can only hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always - only RSVP if you are going to come and update ASAP if your plans change. Don't be a flake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to get there - take the greenline B train to Packard's corner (super 88) and walk a few blocks or take it one more stop to Harvard Ave and walk to Brighton Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking - always tough in this area. There are more spots available closer towards Super 88.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be outside area after we put in reservations.
