If skies are clear there will be a good view of Boston and Cambridge on top. On the way back we will see the outside of the JFK House.  We will go through beautiful neighborhoods and enjoy great scenery.  The trip should last about 1 Â½ - 2 hours and will be a lot of fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the new meeting place and time.  Panera Bread has great baked goods, coffee and a patio area for us to meet.  Several people have wanted to go on the walks but could not make 7:00 because they had to work late.  I am hoping that 8:00 works better.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200877557000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Walkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Evening-Walkers</urlname><id>865474</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Evening Walkers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200191829000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Griggs Park, Summit Hill and the JFK House Loop</name><id>7100788</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200704400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Evening-Walkers/events/7100788/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/d/e/global_2736734.jpeg</photo_url></item>
