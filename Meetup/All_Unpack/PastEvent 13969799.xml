Anybody want to go on a cruise, say Thursday July 22nd at 7:00 pm? I've placed it as an event on the Nerd Fun calendar. Go to &lt;a href="http://www.groupon.com/boston/deals/boston-harbor-cruises-2?utm_campaign=UserReferral&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=uu382113" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.groupon.co...&lt;/a&gt; to purchase the Groupon.com. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Groupon is purchased, in a few days we all need to call Boston Harbor Cruises by phone at (617) 227-4321 to make a reservation for our Groupon and schedule our cruise for Thursday July 22nd. I expect that their phone lines will be tied up for the next couple of days. Or maybe during the week people can pop in to their ticket booth in front of Legal Seafoods and the Long Wharf Marriott next to the Aquarium and redeem the Groupon printouts there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunset Cruise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Harbor Cruises&lt;br /&gt;Long Wharf, Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;7:00 pm - 8:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;$20.00, 90 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer  is full swing, along with this summer's theme of exploring the Boston Harbor: by guided tour, by National Park Ranger and by speedboat (Codzilla scheduled, soon!). Join us as Nerd Fun relaxes on a Sunset Cruise. They recommend for people to be there at least a half hour in advance. We should be docked at Long Wharf by 8:30 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.bostonharborcruises.com/boston-harbor-cruises/sunset-cruise.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonharb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A spectacular sunset adds a whole new dimension to this 90-minute sightseeing tour. With this cruise you'll be introduced to all the history, sights and lore that Boston Harbor has to offer, plus you'll be on hand to witness the USS Constitution's sunset serenade as she fires her cannon and lowers her flag ceremoniously signaling the day's end&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purchasing Tickets:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Go to &lt;a href="https://secure4.gatewayticketing.com/BostonHarborCruises/shop/ViewItems.aspx?CG=EXCR&amp;amp;C=SS" target="_blank"&gt;https://secure4.gatew...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Select the 22nd of July. &lt;br /&gt;* Confirm that the date for the 7:00 pm sunset cruise now says 7/22/2010&lt;br /&gt;* Select 7:00 pm, and re-confirm you are purchasing the &amp;quot;Sunset Cruise Adult 7/22/2010 7:00 PM&amp;quot; ticket&lt;br /&gt;* Complete transaction&lt;br /&gt;* Update your RSVP on the Nerd Fun site so that people can see who is coming. &lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Exchange your Groupon printouts with actual tickets at the white Boston Harbor Cruises ticket booth on the docks for actual tickets.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ship will depart at 7:00 pm.
