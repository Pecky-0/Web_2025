While everyone wants to be there on July 4, the more enjoyable concerts are the less crowded events during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for a picnic and concert by the Boston Landmarks Orchestra led by Christopher Wilkins, conductor. They will perform music of Mozart and Haydn. Program information is at the orchestra&amp;rsquo;s website. We&amp;rsquo;ll gather starting at 5:30PM for socializing and a pot-luck picnic. 
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Look for our big blue tarp near the front center of the oval&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Bring a picnic item to share plus a beverage&lt;/span&gt;. Use your imagination as to what people might like; appetizers, main dishes, salads, desserts are all welcome. We&amp;rsquo;ll provide the plates, cups, utensils, etc. Important: Bring a low lawn chair (beach chair) or blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hatch Shell is on the Charles River Esplanade next to Storrow Drive in Back Bay at Arlington Street. Detailed directions are at the Hatch Shell website. Parking is very limited. The right lane of Storrow Drive westbound between Berkeley and Gloucester is available for parking starting about 30 minutes before the concert. These spaces fill rapidly. Most Back Bay and Beacon Hill streets are resident-only parking. The metered areas on Beacon between Arlington and Clarendon as well as on Berkeley, Clarendon and Charles Streets are open for visitor parking. Check the signs to be safe. The most convenient and reasonably priced garage is the Boston Common Underground Garage. Entrance is on Charles Street. BY MBTA (strongly recommended): Take the Red Line to Charles/MGH or the Green Line to Arlington; each is about a ten minute walk away. Back Bay Station (Orange Line/commuter rail) is a 15 minute walk away.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>4094202</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1314282699000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Active "People" people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1425</urlname><id>1283834</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Sitzundjibers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312562154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gather for Music on the Charles</name><id>28386421</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1314221400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1425/events/28386421/</event_url></item>
