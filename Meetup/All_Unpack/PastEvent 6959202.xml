Then we will proceed to assist Eric with a lit drop to Manchester Voting District #2. Bring stuff if you have it and remember hats and gloves if it is supposed to be cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location will be the greater Tolland County area. We will meet at 10:00 a.m., wave signs for an hour or so and then head out to the designated canvassing areas. We meet back in the afternoon to report results and do a 2nd sign wave, possibly with new meetup members who couldn't make the first one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turnout for canvassing has been low. It's the Holidays, it's cold, we're all very busy. That's why I'd like to do the second wave where maybe people who worked or had errands can stop for an hour and help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the handouts. We have the yard signs. We will have DVD's. We need Ron Paul supporters in the streets getting this material to the uninformed masses.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll see the signs.
