Summer is definitely here, and what better way to enjoy a summer day than by playing some football? We are a fun group that gets together weekly, and sometimes more, to play football. Its all about the fun, so don't worry if you are rusty or even have never played flag-football. You are still welcome and we aim to make everyone feel comfortable. The field is conveniently located across the Alewife Brook Pkwy from the Alewife Station (Redline). Right off of Rindge Ave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we hope to see you there this weekend, and be sure to bring some water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213647133000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213115312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FLAG FOOTBALL - SAT 4PM - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8116385</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213473600000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8116385/</event_url></item>
