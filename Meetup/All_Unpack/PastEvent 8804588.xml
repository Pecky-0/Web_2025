We will walk through both. Carpooling is necessay because there is parking for 4 cars only and roadside parking is not permitted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Property Description:&lt;br /&gt;Peters Reservation, named for the family who, in 1917, purchased the property as a family retreat, is dominated by an oak and hickory forest, whose trails and understory plantings were laid out by landscape architect Fletcher Steele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plantation of red pines lines much of the Reservation's frontage on the Charles River. Over two miles of trails traverse woodlands featuring a large, massed planting of Dexter hybrid rhododendrons. A short trail extension on the other side of Farm Street links Peters Reservation to Chase Woodlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Get There:&lt;br /&gt;By car: From Dover Center, follow Springdale Ave. west for 0.8 mi. Turn left onto Farm St. and follow for 1.8 mi. to entrance and parking (strict 4-car limit) on left. This parking area serves both Chase Woodlands and Peters Reservation.
