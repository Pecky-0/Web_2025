We will be playing against each other and having a fun time. We will be playing on a padded floor, wearing socks. The arena is air conditioned and is smaller than a typical dodgeball court. Dodgeball is a lot of fun, so be sure to join us. It doesn't matter if you haven't played since you were a kid, everyone is welcome to participate and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no fee to attend, but members are invited to donate between $5-10 at the door (cash only) to support the Not Me charity which provides self defense classes for Boston youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please look for Catherine inside the entrance or on the dodgeball court, if you need help finding us, please call 774 232 0000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint event with other meet up groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to bring socks with you in order to play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dodgeball of Boston is located at Together in Motion, 1 Broadway in Arlington, at the intersection of Rte 16 and Broadway on the Arlington/Somerville line.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please look for Catherine inside the entrance or on the dodgeball court, if you need help finding us, please call 774 232 0000.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Catherine </member_name><member_id>6146290</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282350598000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metrowestyoungprofessionals</urlname><id>951974</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Metro West Young Professionals Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280954377000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fun Dodgeball Night at Dodgeball of Boston!
