I just realized that the automatically scheduled date was on labor day weekend and I'll be out of town. If people would prefer to meet on the 6th, that's fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meet up will simultaneously serve to introduce local Scrabble players to each other as well as allow us to get a few games in. Bring your boards or just bring yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the last meetup we had 3 boards and six players, so it worked out perfectly. In a little less than 2 hours we played two games each. I will bring 1 board with me and a dictionary, more are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can also talk a little more about whether to keep the group on Meetup or move it to a different web site. New folks especially are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Au Bon Pain is pretty empty on Sundays--you will have no trouble spotting the Scrabble boards. Some folks may wander in late so don't leave if it looks empty at first.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Quinten</member_name><member_id>9980941</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254672723000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Word Freaks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston</urlname><id>1385528</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Scrabble Enthusiasts of (Greater) Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249232691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scrabble Enthusiasts of Boston September Meetup-Davis Square (moved to 9/13)</name><id>11015131</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252857600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston/events/11015131/</event_url></item>
