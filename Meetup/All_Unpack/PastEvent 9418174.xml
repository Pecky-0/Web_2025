Steady snow at 6 PM. Temp 25 F for whole hike. Winds very low at 2 MPH. Trail may have some ice on it in places from the freezing rains a couple days ago so boots with good traction is a must. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very easy and lovely fairly level 2-3 mile hike at the Belding Trout Management Area in Vernon. This 2 hour long hike is very pleasent and is great for beginners and is scenic enough with the forest, stream, and dammed pond to interest more advanced hikers. We'll hike as much as we can in the 2.5 hours alotted. This area is a hidden gem and even connects to Valley Falls, the Hop River Linear Trail, the Schinipsit Trail, and some Northern Connecticut Land trust property! How's that for location? Dogs and kids welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at trailhead parking (end of cul-de-sac on Tamarac Ln., Vernon, CT) but this can be somewhat limited depending on the number of attendees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate trailhead parking for hike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=99+Tamarac+ln&amp;amp;city=vernon&amp;amp;state=ct" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/photos/84966/513251/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct any questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
