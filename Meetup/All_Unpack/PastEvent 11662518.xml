This filled a lot of gaps for me regarding portraiture that I hadn't picked up from other courses that had just covered lighting in general. A fun and open learning environment. Thanks!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ Informative and fun; plenty of hands-on practice. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ Jason and Ken both did an awesome job. Basic instructions then they just let us get our hands dirty using the equipment - truly the only way to learn! ” &lt;br /&gt;“ I had a great time. It was a wonderful opportunity to have some hands on with the equipment, talk to other photographers and take pictures for 3 hours. I loved the handout and think that was such a great idea. I've taken other photography classes, paid more and seemed to have gotten less out of it. It's the class that could never end because there is soooo much to learn about lighting that I could have stayed another 3 hours. ”&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256744257000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Photography-Workshops</urlname><id>1540111</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>New England Photography Workshops</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255981110000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portrait lighting 101</name><id>11662518</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256407200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Photography-Workshops/events/11662518/</event_url></item>
