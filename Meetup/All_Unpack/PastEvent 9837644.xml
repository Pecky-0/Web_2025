With plenty of time for doing your own thing, we'll have some activities planned including meditation, long nature walks, experiences of the senses, mindful eating, and being with others who similarly seek more awareness and clarity in their lives. If you've never been to Morse Mountain, this is truly an amazing place (see web link above). With more than 180 degree views of the ocean from atop Morse Mountain, you can just sit for hours and appreciate the grand beauty of the Maine coast, walk for miles on mountain paths and sandy beaches, eat scrumptious food, and enjoy the company of fellow meditators as we seek to create a unique and fulfilling mindful experience. We're limited to 10 people this time, and if the response is good, we can plan for other similar events, and perhaps some with larger venues later. The 75 dollar fee includes two nights lodging, breakfast and dinner, some snacks, and non-adult beverages. Participants will be encouraged to submit ideas for activities and issues to be considered in creating the agenda. We will have more details about this and an agenda later, and will be polling attendees to seek ideas for how to spend our days, and intend for this to be co-facilitated by all who wish to be a part of it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Arrange to meet at the public parking lot at the base of the mountain.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241472895000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235750344000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Mindful Weekend Experience</name><id>9837644</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241211600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9837644/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
