This is great way to see really good local contemporary art and meet the artists and ask them questions. They are usually more than willing to meet new people and talk about their artwork. The galleries provide light refreshments and sometimes there is even live entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Remember to be specific as to what you like about theire art. It helps them a great deal. The art studios are also opened on First Friday, so we might try that well. We'll set out about 6:45 PM. If you're late, we'll leave word with the cafe' as to which galleries we'll going to. This will be regular on-going activity.&lt;/p&gt;
