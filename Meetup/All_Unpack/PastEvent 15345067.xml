The parade route starts at the South Main ST entrance of Hunking Middle School in Bradford and ends on Kenoza Street in Haverhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in front of Rite Aid in Bradford, which will also be the location address. At this time, we do not know what the parking limitations are but will update the site once we find out. After everyone arrives at Rite Aid, remember we will only wait 15 minutes over the event time, we will walk down S Main Street and pick the best spot to watch the parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children are more than welcome to this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember, for the month of Nov &amp;amp; Dec we are collecting supplies for the Christmas gift packs at Lazarus House. If you would like to make a donation, please see the message board for the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are due to pay your yearly dues, please be prepared to pay them at this event. Also, don't forget our fund raiser, the Mass Pass Books, these books make perfect Christmas presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget, if your plans change please update your RSVP and if you are running late or lost please call the organizers on the Meetup cellphone 978-304-2811.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all at the Santa Parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290383571000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288920465000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Santa Parade in Haverhill MA</name><id>15345067</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290360600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/15345067/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/c/e/global_19391582.jpeg</photo_url></item>
