Once again this would be another all-day 1PM -  dusk deal where you could come and go anytime during to volunteer to speak with people passing through. The entry ticket is $4/person but can be used to go in and out whenever you wish. There might be a carload price too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541681000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183085672000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hillsborough 4th of July</name><id>5951251</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183568400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/5951251/</event_url></item>
