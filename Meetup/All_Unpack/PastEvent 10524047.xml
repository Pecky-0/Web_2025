Will head in for seats around 6:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing my Boston Movie Group Badge. If the movie is showing downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.  If it is upstairs I will be in the area by the big window near the coffee/icecream consession stand (I will try to grab a table).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally we head in half an hour before the film starts to get seats.   If you miss the group on the way in, we gather outside the theater (room it is showing in) and discuss the movie and where we can go afterwards for drinks and munchies, so you can find us then.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Jim Broadbent, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, David Bradley, Jessie Cave, Frank Dillane, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch, Helen McCrory, Natalia Tena, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Bonnie Wright&lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy&lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: PG (for scary images, some violence, language and mild sensuality)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince/" target="_blank"&gt;http://harrypotter.wa...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadnâ€™t counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simpering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing my Boston Movie Group Badge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>19</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253874674000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243621324000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harry Potter</name><id>10524047</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247868900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/10524047/</event_url></item>
