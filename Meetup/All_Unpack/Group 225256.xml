We see all kinds of movies at theaters around town and occasionally in the suburbs. We usually head out to a restaurant afterwards for some munchies and a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our social gatherings, free movie preview events are announced to our members. Typically a pass is made available that members can print out. But be advised, it's first come first serve, and the theaters do fill up. You can show up and not get in - so be early! And those events typically aren't social, just an opportunity to see a movie for free before everyone else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group's organizers do have a favor to ask - if you RSVP "yes" to an event, please do come, or change your RSVP to "no".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on out! Treat yourself to a movie and a lively discussion! We love movies and if you do too, come and join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.35</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1140735210000</created><lat>42.3499984741</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1201</id><urlkey>movies</urlkey><name>Movie Fans</name></topics_item></topics><name>Boston Movie Group</name><id>225256</id><members>3503</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>4478749</member_id><name>Frederick Hill</name></organizer><urlname>movies-280</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/e/c/600_191719692.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/e/c/highres_191719692.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>191719692</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/e/c/thumb_191719692.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/</link><lon>-71.0599975586</lon></item>
