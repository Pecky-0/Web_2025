We play on a sand court and all levels of experience are welcome. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be following the rules and keeping score, but having fun and learning will be more important than winning. We work on trying to keeping the volley going, rather than trying to end the volley. So, bring your friends and teens, your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and insect repellent. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Don’t want to play but want to spend the day cheering us on?   Just bring a lawn chair and join us on the sideline.    I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ladder golf and 2 badmitten raquets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will bring charcoal and plates.  Bring whatever you want to cook and drink.  If you want to bring something to share like a salad, chips or dessert it would be helpful to list what you are bringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location:   Merrifield Park, Ferry St. Hudson, NH 03051&lt;/p&gt;
