Let's meet in Piers Park in East Boston for 'Art in the Park'. Some of you have expressed an interest in the use of art and music for relaxation. Being and Art Therapist I couldn't say no to that! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will do a short guided relaxation exercise and a variety of creative activities involving art and music. If there is interest we could also take a walk afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never been to Piers Park, it is worth the trip! The park offers spectacular views of downtown Boston and a direct access to waterfront. It is accessible by subway or car. There is free parking available.
