Email me with any questions!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not a shelter in this area that we can be under. So Im hoping that it does not rain and in the meantime maybe I can find a place that at least the soles can meet to get things going. If anyone has any idea please feel free to email me or start a message conversation on this meetup! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime PLEASE answer the questions that I made up so I know where everyone is and I can start figuring out what kind a training to start with. For example: Do I need to start everyone in a &amp;quot;Puppy type Class&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Intermediate type Class?&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You All!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the Parking lot with the Dogs!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jamie</member_name><member_id>8350267</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246226689000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245373149000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TRAINING MEETING</name><id>10684882</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246053600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10684882/</event_url></item>
