&lt;p&gt;Join us for Cocktails and apps at 6:30 at Midwest Grill in Saugus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 cents wings Special !!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Midwest Grill is a Brazilian BBQ, Churrascaria Rodizio restaurant. We have been serving tender, mouth–watering meat, along with delicious seafood and vegetarian dishes since 1993. Our original location is in Cambridge (near Innman Square) and our second location is on Rte 1 North in Saugus. Both locations feature the Churrascaria Rodizio, which consists of perfectly grilled and seasoned meat circulated by our staff and carved at your table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both locations have great bars with several big screen TV's. It is a great place to unwind after work, while enjoying a refreshing cocktail and an even better place to catch a game and have some fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of parking in the lot or a tad down Merrimac St there is a public lot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come on out, toss your responsibilities away and kick back with a tasty beverage drink and good conversation. You know you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
