Join me for this free info. session and see if you want to go through the program with me in the new year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLS is not a diet, it is a lifestyle program. It is science based and the TLS coaches are trained. Many of our coaches are also health professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;span&gt;LS Weight Loss Solution teaches low-glycemic eating and how to identify new favorite foods, creating new, healthy behaviors, and improving body composition to get metabolism operating in high gear. It also provides supplements/vitamins when needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a program designed around a client/patient's goals, and their commitment level to achieving their personal health and fitness goals. It’s not about trying to fit in a box while saying, "just eat this and not that" or "do this, don’t do that." It’s customized to the individual, and is designed to keep them on track to achieve their personal weight loss goals and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
