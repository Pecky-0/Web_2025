<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our February meetup will be held a little later in the month due to Canine Good Citizen Testing going on at the center.  I apologize if this inconveniences anyone.  We will play in our indoor room again since it is so cold outside!  I think the dogs would like it, but I can't say the same for the owners!!  Anyone and everyone with a friendly dog is welcome to attend.  Hope to see you then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held at Best Friends Pet Care off of Rt-97 less than a mile from I-95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203963091000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200164703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs February Meetup</name><id>7097747</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203789600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/7097747/</event_url></item>
