Historically the home of a major granite industry, it is dotted with secluded, small quarries, which make ideal swimming spots. It is also a major lobster fishing center and artist colony.   The plan is to bike south across the island and take a dip in one of two rock quarries along the way.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for more information:&lt;br /&gt;www.vinalhaven.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;time permiting, on the way home, brief stop at LL Bean in Freeport&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer &lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the Disclaimer and things you must know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Note: &lt;br /&gt;This activity can be done individually or as part of the following itinerary.
