Sure to have some nonsensical plot elements and perhaps a bit of over-the-top violence, it should be some interesting, somewhat mindless visual action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided you can stay up late: we'll be going to see it at the CT Post Mall Cinema de Lux (&lt;a href="http://www.nationalamusements.com/theatres/current_theatre.asp?theatre=9930" target="_blank"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) in Milford at 9:20pm.  The film is 1hr, 50min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;VIOLENCE:&lt;/b&gt; For those concerned the film might be violent, you can get precise text descriptions of what violence, gore, profanity, etc is in movie by clicking &lt;a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/2008/wanted.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESERVED SEATING:&lt;/b&gt; It's showing in the Director's Hall, which is reserved seating.  We'll probably buy tickets around 8:15, then may grab a quick bite.  If you're coming, and you're someone I've met before, if you want me to get you a ticket together with us, I can do that and then you pay me when you show up.  If I don't know you, you can Paypal me the ticket fee in advance.  Or just link up with us and we'll all buy tickets together.  Though Tue. 9:20 may be pretty dead so &amp;quot;seat jumping&amp;quot; may be easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRE-PARTY:&lt;/b&gt; If anyone wants to get a quick bite before, we're probably up for that.  Get in touch if you're interested and we'll see if we can make something happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; Jason, cell 203-901-4957 (calling or texting is fine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt; 95 S to x39B, turn right at first entrance to mall.  The theater is in the right end of the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215134816000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214886445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tue. 7/1 - Attack of the Drones</name><id>8251497</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214961300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8251497/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
