The trailhead is on the noprtheast side of Lake Rd, 3.5 miles from Moose Pond Dam on 160 in Denmark, and 2.9 miles from 302 in East Fryeberg. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPS coordinates&lt;/b&gt;: 44.007072, -70.853266&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=44.007072,-70.853266" target="_blank"&gt;Map of 44.007072, -70.853266&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;: 8.4 miles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation gain&lt;/b&gt;: ~2100 ft &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Time&lt;/b&gt;: 5 hours and 15 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trails&lt;/b&gt;: McKay Pasture Trail, Ledges Trail, Bald Peak Trail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is in Denmark, Maine about 20 miles east of Conway&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant Mtn is an isolated mass that stretches 4 miles. It was burned over in 1860 providing for many fine views. Pleasant Mtn is the location of Shawnee Peak ski area and a fire tower. We will be coming up the south side avoiding all signs of the ski area on the north. Once we reach the firetower we will continue on the ridge to Bald Peak, then return. It can  be extended by walking further to the top of the ski area before returning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your rsvp's up to date.
