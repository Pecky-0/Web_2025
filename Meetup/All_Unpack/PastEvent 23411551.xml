&lt;p&gt;So Annie has agreed to head up a Waterfire Click and shoot where we can all car pool and save on parking costs and enjoy a fun evening of shooting. Remember to bring a tripod! Bring $ to split gas costs too... wear comfy shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterfire is part event, part art. &amp;nbsp;There is good music, good &lt;br /&gt;

 smells and LOTS of people (this can get VERY crowded). &amp;nbsp;This is &lt;br /&gt;

 a great opportunity to put the night time photography &lt;br /&gt;

 techniques we reviewed at the June Monthly meeting into &lt;br /&gt;

 practice. &amp;nbsp; We can carpool from the Worcester area down to &lt;br /&gt;

 Providence or meet at a location near the river. &amp;nbsp;Since you &lt;br /&gt;

 will want to be on a tripod I suggest getting there before dark &lt;br /&gt;

 and being settled before they start the burning. &amp;nbsp;We can take &lt;br /&gt;

 the opportunity to watch out for each others gear and also get &lt;br /&gt;

 to do some walking &amp;amp; visiting street vendors for food. &amp;nbsp;Another &lt;br /&gt;

 option is to pack a meal so you don't have to leave your gear. &lt;br /&gt;

 If enough folks sign up we may want to split into two groups &lt;br /&gt;

 and have one group in the basin, and one further up the river. &lt;br /&gt;

 There are also some street performers (statues and whatnot) &lt;br /&gt;

 that are good photo ops. &amp;nbsp;Burning is scheduled to begin at 8:05 &lt;br /&gt;

 so we will want to get down there about 6:30 or so to scout &lt;br /&gt;

 locations while it is still light and not so crowded.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to Email&lt;/p&gt;
