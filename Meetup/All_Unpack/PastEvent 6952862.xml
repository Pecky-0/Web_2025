I apologize to all group members and co-organizers if I was unclear on this. What I meant to say was that with the holidays, there would probably be no new events until the weekend after New Year's. Which doesn't mean we can't post events for later in the month in January. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll start the new year with Bergman's &amp;quot;The Magic Flute&amp;quot;. Probably the most un-Bergman of Bergman films, I saw this 20 years ago and was quite enchanted.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolutely dazzling film entertainment, so full of beauty, intelligence, wit, and fun that it becomes a testimonial not only to man's possibilities but also to his high spirits. All of the best Bergman films have been about some aspect of love (often its absence), but The Magic Flute is virtually an act of it .Mr. Bergman hasn't set out to interpret The Magic Flute but rather to present it as it originally was, bursting with the life of an exquisite stage production as it would look within the physical limitations of an eighteenth-century court theater. NY Times &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mozart wrote &amp;quot;The Magic Flute&amp;quot; for a vaudevillian theatre, and the story is a silly one dealing with monsters, gods, and a couple people who are just looking for love.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're supposed to be conscious of watching a performance, and yet at some level Bergman also wants Mozart's fantasy to work as a story, a preposterous tale, and it does. This must be the most delightful film ever made from an opera.  Roger Ebert &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stockholm's Drottningholm Theater is a marvel: a still-working theater with 18th-century stage machinery. Bergman takes full advantage of both the theater?s wonders and Mozart's music in his staging of the opera The Magic Flute (performed here in Swedish) and in turn, his filming of that staging. The tale of young lovers tested is set against Bergman's attention to the goings-on in the wings during the performance, and in the audience. .
