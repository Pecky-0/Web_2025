So here's an opportunity to do exactly that. Whether you're already working on a journal and want to share it or need your colleagues' advice on turning a blank book into a work of art, this is the session for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;Please note, though:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is a play date, not a class; we won't be offering any formal instruction this time. But we'll have a blast while learning from each other, and we may have other events down the road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAY/TIME:&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, Feb. 21, 1 p.m. to ???? (Really, we'll stay as late as anybody wants to stay!) Arrive and leave when you like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; AMENITIES: &lt;/b&gt;Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (professional-strength paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST:&lt;/b&gt; $10. This helps cover the cost of renting our space. Exact change is greatly appreciated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/b&gt; Any member of the NE ATC+, Altered Art/Assemblage or Mass Journaling Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your own journal, if you have one (or even some cardstock or chipboard to make journal pages). Any kind of journal will do; the format is up to you. (If you'd like to alter an old book, we have plenty available.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The craft supplies you'll need during the session. No supplies? No problem. Basic tools -- scissors, glue, acrylic paint, collage materials, etc. -- are available for your use at no charge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something to drink (optional) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacks to share (optional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; HOW TO SIGN UP&lt;/b&gt;: RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function so we know who's coming and how many to expect. RSVP for your guests as well. &lt;u&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP&lt;/u&gt;. We have a waiting list, so PLEASE do this right up to the start time for the event. If you don't show up and don't change your RSVP, you may be asked to pay the Meetup fee anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/b&gt; If we need to cancel due to weather or any reason--or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot; So please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>emelengy</member_name><member_id>4250560</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1266948725000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264549762000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special NE ATC+ Meetup: A Day of Art Journaling</name><id>12432700</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266775200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/12432700/</event_url></item>
