Fridays are usually very mellow so you'll get to do plenty of climbing. We typically wait until about 7:15 pm for everybody to arrive and then we'll team up. If you happen to come after we've already hit the walls, just find us climbing. And, if you miss the happy hour too much, we'll go for food/drinks after climbing. So come on out and meetup with old friends and/or make some new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt; for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will wait at the picnic table until 7:15.
