Note that this one will be SUNDAY, not on Saturday -- we met on Saturday last month, and we alternate so that everyone will have the chance to attend at least every other meeting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that we'll be at the Newton Center Starbuck's again, which turned out to be a pretty nice location for last month's meeting.  It's still a bit loud, but easier to get to than Roslindale, so until something better comes along... see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1117483511000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1113080587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction Writers May Meetup</name><id>4550057</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1116187200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/4550057/</event_url></item>
