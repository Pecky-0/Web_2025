We invited the top-class Noh actors and the producer who will be in the Noh performance to be hosted by MIT Japan Program this November. The guests include two actors from Kanze-Ryu, Mr. Kanji Shimizu and Mr. Takao Nishimura (both appointed as intangible cultural properties by Japanese govermenet), the producer Mr. Kenichi Kasai, and more. In the workshop, they will show you the exotic masks, clothing, and instruments to be used in the performance, and they will also play the instruments. This is really a rare opportunity to learn about Noh directly from the top performers. We are honored and thrilled to host this event, and look forward to seeing you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open to the general public&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: Free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponsor(s): Japanese Association of MIT (JAM)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177277992000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175887030000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Noh (Japanese Traditional Theater) Workshop</name><id>5644792</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177104600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/5644792/</event_url></item>
