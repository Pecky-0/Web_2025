Lisa is sharing her home with us again. Dress up green to celebrate St. Patty! Bring that swap gift all wrapped...spend around $10.00 if you can. Bonnie-our organizer for the south shore-southeastern meet-up will run the swap. Lisa will cook up a great irish dinner. Everyone bring a small side. Bring your beverage of choice. I will bring the desert...I'm sure the L word will be on the big screen. We had alot of fun last time at Lisa's. Let's do it again!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 6874991</member_name><member_id>6874991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237650627000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Gay Women Over 40</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>lgbtfriends-212</urlname><id>1155810</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>WEST OF BOSTON OVER 40 GAY WOMENS MEET-UP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234978238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>St. Patty's Yankee Swap and  Potluck</name><id>9768480</id><headcount>38</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237057200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lgbtfriends-212/events/9768480/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/0/global_4210720.jpeg</photo_url></item>
