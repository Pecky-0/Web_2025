But the band soon began experimenting with their own unique versions of R&amp;amp;B classics from James Brown, Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye and their contemporaries. This evolved further with the addition of classic Motown hits, contemporary funk, soul, and R&amp;amp;B flavored rock songs to their large and varied, dance-oriented song list. The resulting mix has become the staple of the band's offering to live audiences. Continuous appearances at a variety of venues have established the Bernadettes as one of the area's premier live acts. They were voted the best rhythm and blues band in the New Haven Advocate "Sounds of New Haven" 1996 readers poll, and also chosen by that paper as New Haven's #1 bar band. A constantly growing songlist, matched with the band's frenetic brand of soul, make for a memorable evening for anyone who wants to move their feet and dance to the beat.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>simone</member_name><member_id>7013797</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Renay</member_name><member_id>24455832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348530547000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
