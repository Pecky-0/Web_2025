I am merely inviting everyone in the group to show up and ride bikes.  If you ride a vintage 3 speed beach cruzer you will fit in.  If you ride a $1500 carbon fiber road bike you will fit in.  If you ride a custom built franken-bike with a basket for your pet poodle on the handlebars you will fit in. etc, etc, etc.  The ride speed is VERY slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Critical Mass?  More info here: &lt;a href="http://www.bostoncriticalmass.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.bostoncriticalmass.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People start gathering at Copley Square at 5:30, and once a large group has assembled, the ride begins!  (If you are running a bit late, dont fret... the ride usually starts just before 6pm)  There is no official route, and you can leave the ride at any time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you end up really far away from where you live or where you parked, you can always take the T after 7pm.  Here are the rules for bikes on the T: &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/riding_the_t/bikes/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/riding_the_t/bikes/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mbta.com/r...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am NOT the organizer or in charge in any way at all... but I will be there and if you see me feel free to say hello! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jon&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have my trusty orange messenger bag</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon Ramos</member_name><member_id>4466935</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209332221000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>if you have never been to a critical mass bike ride, you haven't see it all.
