<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>**Sunset variation** A 2.5 mile hike that starts out at the parking lot on the side of the mountain and up to the cliff face for the beautiful views to the west for hopefully a wonderful sunset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area near the Yellow tailhead (Tower trail) on the park road off of Rte. 185 at 7 PM. We'll hike up the Yellow trail and make it to the tower or a better spot by 8 PM and watch for the sunset at 8:30 PM. Then we'll hike back down the Yellow trail to the cars before the gate gets locked. We have until at least 9 PM to get to the cars per the ranger. The fist part of the Yellow trail is steep so we'll take it slow. The hike is anticipated to take about 2 hours, including watching the sunset, and we should be done by about 9 PM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Please bring a flashlight in case it gets a little dark as we head back to the cars. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;557 acres with hiking trails on Talcott Mt. Beautiful views from the mountain of 1,200 square miles. A 165 foot tower sits at the top. The state website says the park is in Bloomfield but the bulk of the park with entrance road and tower are in Simsbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions can be found in the notes area of this event. Kevin S will lead and is the contact for this one. No meal is planned after the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** There is a 30% chance of isolated thunderstoms in the long range forcast as of 6/28/06 so good chance for sunset. Hope for the best! I'll update here on the forcast as we get closer.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From I-91 North or South: take Exit 35B, which is the Bloomfield Route 218 exit.
