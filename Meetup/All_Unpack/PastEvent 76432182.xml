This is a fun event in the great atmosphere of Fenway Park, and the actual volunteering is quite easy. This is a great way to get into the park and enjoy the game for free! Boston Rotaract has volunteered at several games before, and we've all had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make it, please RSVP here on Meetup as well as get in contact with Justine Grosso (Boston Rotaract VP, grosso.justine@gmail.com), who will need to submit names in advance to the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear comfortable close-toed shoes (sneakers are fine) that you can walk in. No flip flops.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yun</member_name><member_id>22082071</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344391649000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrotaract</urlname><id>1501340</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Rotaract - A Service/Social Club for 18-30 Yr Olds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344186628000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Volunteer at Fenway Park - see the Red Sox play and get a free hotdog!</name><id>76432182</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344380400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrotaract/events/76432182/</event_url></item>
