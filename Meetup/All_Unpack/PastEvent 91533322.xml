&lt;p&gt;As a group, we will create a calm and honoring process and a safe supportive way to learn some techniques.  We will start with live birds and go through each step in the process, resulting in cleaned chilled birds ready for cooking or the deep freeze.  This workshop will demystify the process for those who are new to it and add some additional skills to the tool kits of those who have done some of this work before.  We will also discuss care and feeding of the animals as a matter of course as we work together during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lunch is potluck with a large soup or stew provided by the host.  Coffee/Tea and am snacks provided.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is only open to 8-10 people and &lt;strong&gt;all participants will take home an organically-raised duck for their own household.&lt;/strong&gt; While ducks and chickens are very similar with regard to this process, we will will be processing ducks on this day and discussing the differences along the way (chickens are actually easier, so if you're comfortable with what you learn in this workshop, chickens will be a snap).  Handouts provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to bring:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work clothes/boots/gloves (latex gloves/aprons provided to those who work the table)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layers of clothing to accommodate the weather variables (hand warming fire and lots of hot beverages on hand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notebook or camera to document learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potluck dish or beverage to share at lunch break and your own potluck kit (plate/bowl/mug/utensils)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
