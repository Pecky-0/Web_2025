This would be relevant to anyone looking to get started in digital photo editing, or who would like to better understand the basic features of their photo editing software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workshop fee is $30. Payment is due when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;Date: Sunday, 11/22/09&lt;br /&gt;Time: 4 - 6 pm&lt;br /&gt;Location: A small conference room at my Somerville office, near Porter Square&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Software Demonstrated:&lt;br /&gt;Photoshop CS3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Computers are not available in the conference room, but the emphasis of this workshop is the concepts of digital image processing, not software training in specific applications.
