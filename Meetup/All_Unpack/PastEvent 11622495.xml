We destroyed them the last two times we played.  Let's try for a third!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for dinner/appetizers/drinks/whatever and some team trivia action.  You don't have to be a master of trivia, and we get to huddle (as a team) before turning in any answers, so there is *NO* pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gas Lamp Grille Features: Great Food, Exotic Beers, Music, sports on their several large-screen plasma televisions, and most importantly, yours truly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking: If you are driving in to Newport the easiest and best priced parking lot is Mary's lot. Mary's lot is located off of Thames. Enter Thames St. at Banana Republic and make first left onto Mary Street, then right into Mary's lot. Gas Lamp grill is on Thames Street to the left of Starbucks - when facing Starbucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trivia starts around 10:15 and goes pretty quickly.  We'll meet at 9:30 so we have time to chat and taunt the other teams with our patented triple Ts (Trivia Trash-Talking).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the Bar - Adam is 5'8" with short dark brown hair, cell: (401) 699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256249601000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255487939000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Gas Lamp Grille - Monday Trivia</name><id>11622495</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256002200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/11622495/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/b/global_11132507.jpeg</photo_url></item>
