Meetup will only let you express times in 15 minnute increments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob Peterson (Mads Mikkelsen) runs a struggling orphanage in India. Desperate to save it from closure, he returns to Denmark to meet Jørgen (Rolf Lassgård), a wealthy businessman and potential benefactor. Jørgen offers Jacob a seemingly innocent invitation to attend his daughter's wedding. What appears to be nothing more than a friendly gesture sets in motion a devastating series of surprises, revelations and confessions that will forever change their lives. Written by Anders Thomas Jensen (Adam's Apples). Directed by Susanne Bier (Brothers, Open Hearts). Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film. (Fully subtitled)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole who will be holding a sign at the front of the theater AFTER the film so we can convene on a local eatery (probably Tommy Doyle's).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178492488000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178045082000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>After the Wedding @ Kendall</name><id>5729503</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178319600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5729503/</event_url></item>
