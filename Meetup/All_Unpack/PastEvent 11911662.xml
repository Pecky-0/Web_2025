Or, just listen to live music performed by your fellow meetup pals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backing band is the &amp;quot;Jukebox Heroes&amp;quot;. They play top 40 songs plus music from the '80s, '90s, and '00s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a joint meetup with &amp;quot;Fun with Alcohol&amp;quot;, so we've reserved a table for about 25 people near the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more plus, The Lansdowne Pub is providing free appetizers for the first hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get together at 8:30PM. That way we'll have time for a few drinks before 9 PM when the Karaoke starts. Nobody should attempt karaoke without having a few drinks first :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on out and channel your inner rock star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Friendly assistant organizer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the "L" shaped table to the left of the stage.
