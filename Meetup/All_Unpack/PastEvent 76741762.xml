&lt;p&gt;The Route 9 Ruby Group is meeting on Wednesday, August 15th at Punchbowl.com's office in Framingham, starting at 5:30pm. Come join your fellow Massachusetts rubyists to talk about how to better our craft, enjoy some free snacks and beer, and meet a few new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month I'll walk us through the exploration of the "Tell, don't ask" principle that Ben Orenstein (Thoughtbot) recently gave on the Giant Robots blog. It generated a lot of great commentary on when to refactor as he demonstrates and when the "bad" code is actually better due to being easier to understand. I think this is a topic we can really sink our teeth into to share our perspectives on what makes for great Ruby code and how to balance short-term schedule and long-term maintainability needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have snacks and beer for refreshments (provided by our sponsor, Punchbowl.com). The event is free, we're right off the pike (exit for Rte 30), and we have ample free parking at the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;
