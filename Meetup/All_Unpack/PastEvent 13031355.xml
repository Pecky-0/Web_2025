Potluck dinner!  Everyone bring a dish.....raw organic please enough for 6 to 8 people so everyone can have a taste.  The food at the meetups has been fantastic!  If you are new and not sure what to bring a salad (veggie or fruit) is always good!  We have no speaker this month but KO may have a few things up her sleeve to keep you entertained!  Not that we need it with this group!  Our members are amazing and everyone has so much to share.  Our community is growing daily because the word is out!  This is the place to be!  See you on the 7th!  Cheers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adults $2&lt;br /&gt;Children always free!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273452889000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269910299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester NH Raw Vegan May Meetup!!</name><id>13031355</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273271400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/13031355/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/b/global_9355803.jpeg</photo_url></item>
