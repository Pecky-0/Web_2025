These were the two top-rated books in our April Poll.&amp;nbsp; Hope to see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #634e91"&gt;The Help, Kathryn Stockett &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;What perfect timing for this optimistic, uplifting debut novel (and maiden publication of Amy Einhorn's new imprint) set during the nascent civil rights movement in Jackson, Miss., where black women were trusted to raise white children but not to polish the household silver. Eugenia Skeeter Phelan is just home from college in 1962, and, anxious to become a writer, is advised to hone her chops by writing about what disturbs you. The budding social activist begins to collect the stories of the black women on whom the country club sets relies and mistrusts enlisting the help of Aibileen, a maid who's raised 17 children, and Aibileen's best friend Minny, who's found herself unemployed more than a few times after mouthing off to her white employers. The book Skeeter puts together based on their stories is scathing and shocking, bringing pride and hope to the black community, while giving Skeeter the courage to break down her personal boundaries and pursue her dreams. Assured and layered, full of heart and history, this one has bestseller written all over it. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #468357"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #3b74a4"&gt;Hiroshima, John Hersey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, few could have anticipated its potential for devastation. Pulitzer prize-winning author John Hersey recorded the stories of Hiroshima residents shortly after the explosion and, in 1946, Hiroshima was published, giving the world first-hand accounts from people who had survived it. The words of Miss Sasaki, Dr. Fujii, Mrs. Nakamara, Father Kleinsorg, Dr. Sasaki, and the Reverend Tanimoto gave a face to the statistics that saturated the media and solicited an overwhelming public response. Whether you believe the bomb made the difference in the war or that it should never have been dropped, "Hiroshima" is a must read for all of us who live in the shadow of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meagan</member_name><member_id>6521348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303948574000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Can't wait to see you there!</why><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293050852000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April's Book Discussion - The Help and Hiroshima</name><id>15801219</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303857000000</time><rsvp_limit>31</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/15801219/</event_url></item>
