Listen to Bob and Martin on the radio:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/27, 4pm ~ Bob Franke &amp;amp; Martin Grosswendt on WUMB, 91.9fm, www.wumb.org&lt;br /&gt;3/28, 5pm ~ Bob Franke &amp;amp; Martin Grosswendt on WGBH, 89.7fm, www.wgbh.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOB FRANKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bobfranke.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bobfranke....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Franke (it rhymes with “Yankee”) is at the peak of his considerable craft; brimming with the wise and spiritually generous songs for which he is best known, along with wrenchingly convincing topical songs and sugared with the hilarious. His are the kind of songs that really do have the power to change the world by being taken into the lives of people. They come to you, these songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Tom Paxton says, &amp;quot;It's his integrity. I always think of Bob as if Emerson and Thoreau had picked up acoustic guitars and gotten into songwriting. There's touches of Mark Twain and Buddy Holly in there, too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MARTIN GROSSWENDT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin Grosswendt, once described by U. Utah Phillips as &amp;quot;a rumor in his own time,&amp;quot; and by David Bromberg as “one of the finest flatpickers on earth” has been a presence on the folk and traditional music scene for nearly three decades. A multi-instrumentalist and singer long known for his skill as an interpreter of 1920s and '30s blues, he is equally at home playing the old-time country music of the Southern Appalachians or the Cajun and Creole music of Southwest Louisiana. A musician's musician and a powerful singer, he is proficient on guitar, five-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, bass, Cajun accordion, and Dobro. His bottleneck guitar playing is especially highly regarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin began his career at the age of 16 as a session musician at Vermont's Philo Records, supplying Dobro and guitar licks for artists such as Phillips, Tom Mitchell, Jim Ringer, and Mary McCaslin. After touring as an accompanist with various artists, he established a solo career playing at festivals and coffeehouses across the country and opening for musicians including Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee, Dave van Ronk, Taj Mahal, David Bromberg, NRBQ, and Sam and Dave. He recorded a solo album for Philo, Dog on a Dance Floor, which was released in 1980. His newest album, Call and Response, was released in 2004 to enthusiastic reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=========&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested minimum donation is $15.00 at the door &amp;amp; $10 for seniors and students with ID.
