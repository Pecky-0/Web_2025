The nice thing about the Cove &lt;br /&gt;

is if it’s raining they setup inside so rain or shine the boys will be playing. This is the band that got rained out at a pass meetup we went to at Walnut beach so this is a good chance to get to see them finish their show. Also not too many more bands on Sunday down at the Cove so let get our dancing shoes on and dance the afternoon away. Hope to see you all there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347228112000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
