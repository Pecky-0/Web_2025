Also some other exciting news and opportunities for some incubators will be announced shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see a ton of you on Thursday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252020731000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251255539000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>From Cambridge to Spain, Nikki's last meetup before she leaves!
