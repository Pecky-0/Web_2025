Why not join NHC'er John for rollerderby with the Connecticut Roller Girls! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time the theme is &amp;quot;Mobsters vs. Cops&amp;quot; as CTRG continues to use their entire league all season to create mixed team face-offs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $10 in advance and $12 at the door. Kids under 12 free with adult admission. Doors open at 6:00 pm, and the event starts at 7:00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food and beer are available, and there is a also a DJ and a live band performing. John says there is plenty of room but not very &lt;br /&gt;many seats, so it's a good idea to bring a folding or collapsible chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see the CT Roller Girls website at www.ctrollerderby.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, John can be reached at 203-500-1039&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236269732000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234627689000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Mobsters vs. Cops" at the CT Rollerderby</name><id>9740800</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235260800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9740800/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
