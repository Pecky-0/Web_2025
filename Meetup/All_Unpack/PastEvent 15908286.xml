<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>(Updated Jan 7th, as 11:30pm) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to meet for dinner at 5:30 at the Flatbread Restaurant / Saco Bowl Haven which is located at 45 Day Street. It's just around the corner from the theater.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;l'll be wearing a &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;red coat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please update your RSVPs so I have a good idea who I should be looking for. If you don't join us for dinner, look for us in the lobby of the theater about 7:00 pm. I'll be wearing a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;red coat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++++++++++ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Social Network is getting a lot of Academy Award buzz and what not. I saw it before and I’d like to see it again before it vanishes out of the theaters. If you have not sent it yet, this may be your last chance before it leaves the theaters. It’s worth the $8. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previews start at 7:15. I’ll be in the lobby at 7:00 then go in about 7:15.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added an RSVP question to see how any of you many be interested in having dinner before the movie, to have so tea after the movie or both. Please let me know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to get to Davis Sq is by Red Line as there is a T stop right next to the theater. There is street parking and lots scattered around the area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 550 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.
