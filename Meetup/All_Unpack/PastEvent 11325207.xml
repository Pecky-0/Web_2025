What is faith?  How delicate is the balance between science and faith?  And, why is it difficult sometimes to hold on to faith?  While Isabeau brings to the table an understanding that stems from spiritual experience and direct experience with higher dimensional spirits, Joel brings to the table a viewpoint of faith that was developed through the witnessing of countless, amazing life stories.  A question and answer session will follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isabeau Esby, a internationally known psychic medium, resides in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  She received a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Minnesota with a major in Mathematics and minors in Biology and Teaching.  In addition to psychic readings, she works as a spiritual counselor and volunteers her time working with patients who are being cared for by their families in their last days of life as well as helping people to understand their own psychic abilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Glenn Wixson holds a doctorate in clinical psychology, a masters in substance abuse counseling and is a certified addiction specialist.  He is the co-founder of The Living Way, center for organic learning, has a private practice in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and is on the faculty of Leslie University’s Division of Counseling and Psychology.
