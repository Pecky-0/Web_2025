The weather is supposed to clear up after the morning. I haven't been in a few weeks, and I can't wait to get out there. Please join me and others for some flag-football. Its a fun time and you can get some exercise. We've been playing on a nice turf field, so even if it rains, your clothes will get wet, but not muddy. I hope you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211220575000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210800776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FLAG FOOTBALL SAT 2PM RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>7939502</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211047200000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/7939502/</event_url></item>
