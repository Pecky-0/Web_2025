Want the celebration but not the noise and bustle of the crowd? Tired of losing sight of your friends, only to have them call your cell right as the fireworks begin? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then come to the top level of Temple St Garage and watch the fireworks with a certain sense of calm...bring your brown-bagged drinks, picnic items, etc for a great view of the show! It's strangely quiet up there, even during the fireworks, and it's quite relaxing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fireworks start at 9:15, so I'm suggesting we gather together starting at 8:30. Extra points if you make the attendant think you're going up to your car (assuming you didn't park there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, we can walk around the neighborhood restaurants/bars/movie theatre for a post-party...or disband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Note from dev: If it's raining hard, they/we will cancel the event.   Please call eric's cell before the event if you're unsure if we/they are still having this event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>without asking the attendant about "the party," take elevator to the top level</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric</member_name><member_id>2576129</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215390726000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215019566000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Watch the New Haven Fireworks July 4 at Temple St Garage!</name><id>8264054</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215217800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8264054/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
