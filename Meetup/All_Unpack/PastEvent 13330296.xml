Grace in Warwick, MA&lt;/span&gt; near the NH boarder, we would ride on surface roads avoiding the expressways. The general route would be Rt. 20 to Rt. 140 then pick up Rt. 78 to Mt Grace. The approx distance is about 200 miles. We will stop to eat lunch where ever and take some pictures...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We should get an early start, say about 9:00 am meeting at the Hess Station, we will then meet any additional riders at the Concord rotary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road to the top of Mt. Grace is not paved so the ride is not including a ride to the top of the Mountain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the front of the building along  Comm.
