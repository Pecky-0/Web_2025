&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ffffff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"THE BUTLER DID IT!"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 A new murder mystery by the &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;a href="http://newportmurdermystery.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Marley Bridges Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The Griswold's butler should be fired, but Mr. Griswold just doesn't have the heart to do it. When Mr. Griswold goes to New York on business, the staff decides to throw the butler a party to properly thank him for all that he has done for them. But, when guests start dying, it will take team work, wits and a dash of deviousness to discover who wants the butler dead. Join in the mystery! Search for clues, question suspects and help uncover who-dun-it in this 90 minute interactive murder mystery experience inside the beautiful John N. A. Griswold mansion on Bellevue Avenue, home to the Newport Art Museum and Art Association.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for dinner afterwards, I'm open to suggestions.&amp;nbsp; For now, I'm thinking Griswold's Restaurant or the Black Pearl, but feel free to give me ideas in the comments or in your RSVP and I'll make a decision at least a week prior to the meetup.&amp;nbsp; We'll meet for dinner after the event.&amp;nbsp; If you plan on not joining us for dinner, please let me know in your RSVP so that we know how many will be going for reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Please do not yet purchase tickets until I've notified everyone to do so, depending on how many people sign up, we may be able to get a discount (10 or more get a 30% discount).&amp;nbsp; Tickets are $25 each per person, $13 for children ($$15 for museum members, $8 for children museum members).&amp;nbsp; If anyone is already a member, please get in touch with me - it's probable I might join if we get that group of 10 or more going, as the price breakdown per person would be excessively less (it's a $50 minimum donation to become a member).&amp;nbsp; More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you sign up after tickets have been purchased (check the comments), specifically if we go for the group discount, you will be on your own to purchase tickets, so sign up early.&lt;/p&gt;
