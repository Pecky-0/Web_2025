People had good suggestions for how to present naturalism in a positive light, and for effective, non-confrontational approaches to those with different worldviews. One or two of those attending were somewhat taken aback by the seemingly partisan nature of the proceedings: how to best promote naturalism. But this group exists not only to explore the implications of naturalism as a worldview, but to make it better known and win its acceptance in the wider culture. Hence our name, Allies of Naturalism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For September, I thought we might discuss the rational basis of naturalism. Critics of naturalism sometimes argue that it's premised on an unjustifiable faith in science, to the exclusion of other ways of knowing.  For an example see &lt;a href="http://www.christiancentury.org/article.lasso?id=4497" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a rebuttal &lt;a href="http://centerfornaturalism.blogspot.com/2008/03/naturalism-and-nihilism.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Are they right?  Is naturalism, like theism, in some sense a faith-based worldview?  Or can we claim we're being rational in sticking with science as our way of deciding what's real? If we are, is there a way to persuade supernaturalists that they're being irrational?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;twc  at  naturalism.org  &lt;br /&gt;617-480-8846  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month):   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring and promoting a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>find us downstairs in the corner table most likely</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223941518000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218499686000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The rational basis for naturalism</name><id>8524432</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220914800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/8524432/</event_url></item>
