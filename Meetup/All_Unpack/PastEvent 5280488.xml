<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2-3 mile hike at the Belding Trout Management Area in Vernon. This hour long hike is very pleasent and is great for beginners and is scenic enough with the forest, stream, and dammed pond to interest more advanced hikers. This area is a hidden gem and even connects to Valley Falls, the Hop River Linear Trail, the Schinipsit Trail, and some Northern Connecticut Land trust property! How's that for location? Dogs and kids welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the 7-11 on Route 30 in Vernon at 3:00 PM. Trailhead parking can be somewhat limited so depending on the number of attendees, we may carpool to the trailhead. If there is interest, we'll head out to eat pizza or chinese after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for the Hartford area: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I-84 to Exit 66&lt;br /&gt;* Turn left off the exit and left again at the light. &lt;br /&gt;* Cross over the highway and at the next light, turn right onto Route 30 East. &lt;br /&gt;* Follow Route 30 East to the 7-11 on the left (meet-up location).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader will be either Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/photos/84966/513251/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) or Gloria. Any questions should be directed to Kevin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is in conjunction with the Hartford Heights Tall Club (&lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/399"&gt;http://socialnetwork....&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165427031000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164037576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Belding Wildlife Management Area, Vernon CT</name><id>5280488</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165176000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5280488/</event_url></item>
