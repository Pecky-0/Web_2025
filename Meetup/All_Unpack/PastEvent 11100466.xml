No mention of Thunderstorms so &lt;b&gt;I'm playing the probability and still running this&lt;/b&gt;. Checked radar and dissipating light scattered showers in a front line from southwest to northeast right over hike location. Rain should disappear by hike time. Will keep eye on radar. &lt;b&gt;I have my rain gear so I advise you do the same just in case&lt;/b&gt;. A chance we'll see the sun peek through for sunset! *** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After work hike... last minute I know, but the stars have aligned and I haven't hiked here in about 3 years for some reason... so it's time! This is a nice mostly clifftop hike we'll limit to no more than 3 miles total or in other words about 2 hrs. This hike is an &amp;quot;out and back&amp;quot; style. We may get a great sunset near the end of the hike if the weather cooperates! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start out at the Route 66 parking lot at the western end of Middlefield at 6:00 PM and hike somewhat steeply in places up to the cliffs. Then things mostly level off as we hike the cliffs for about a mile with occasional descents and ascents. We'll time the hike such that we'll reach a far point and start back along the cliffs and maybe catch the sunset on the way back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good views to the West. Not as good as the views from the shorter Chauncey Peak and its associated cliffs. Higby Mt. is about 300 feet higher than Chauncey Peak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Bring water and a flashlight or headlamp just in case as things could get a bit dark on the way back through the forest to the parking lot. *** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Higby Mountain is near the northwestern end of the Mattabesett Trail system. A good map can be found in the &lt;i&gt;Connecticut Walk Book&lt;/i&gt;, 19th Ed., in either the East or West editions, as map MB-8a as published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link provided below takes you to a topographic map of the area centered on the southern part of Higby Mtn.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a general topographical map for Higby Mtn., see:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lon=-72.73965&amp;amp;lat=41.5350&amp;amp;datum=nad83" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.topozone.c...&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;approximate location/directions&lt;/b&gt; to small paved parking lot and starting point on Rt. 66/Meriden Rd., Middlefield: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Middlefield&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=%5B625-681%5D+Meriden+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=06455&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.5303&amp;amp;longitude=-72.73965&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;[Lat.=41.5302, Long.=-72.73965] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions from the Hartford area&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;* Take I-91 South  &lt;br /&gt;* Take the MIDDLE ST./COUNTRY CLUB RD. exit- EXIT 20  &lt;br /&gt;* At the stop sign turn LEFT onto MIDDLE ST and go only a hundred yards or so to another stop sign at COUNTRY CLUB RD.  &lt;br /&gt;* Turn LEFT (East) onto COUNTRY CLUB RD. crossing I-91.  Go, a  &lt;br /&gt;couple of miles to HIGBY RD. which is opposite Moody Elementary School on the right. &lt;br /&gt;* Turn right onto HIGBY RD, going South. &lt;br /&gt;* Go a couple of miles - through a stop sign and to the traffic light at the intersection with ROUTE 66. &lt;br /&gt;* Turn RIGHT (West) onto ROUTE 66/MERIDEN RD. (It's the first intersection where you can go right.)  &lt;br /&gt;* Go what seems like a couple miles - (about 1/2 mile past Guida's Restaurant which is on the right).   &lt;br /&gt;* On the right will be a small parking area at the TRAILHEAD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
