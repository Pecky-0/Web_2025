Disc golf is a sport where you toss frisbee like discs along a path into a metal basket. You don't have to be good at tossing..just come out and have fun and get some fresh air. We always have a good time. There are 18 holes and we'll be out for a few hours.  There is no charge to play here and you can pick up loaner discs at the store across from the park. We will also meet there to make things easier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please join me... remember to wear sneakers or good trail walking shoes and of course some water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions call me at 315-0275&lt;br /&gt;Cindy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are directions to the park..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location Details&lt;br /&gt;03076 Zip/Postal Code: Map Zip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local Directions: 93N; exit 3 (Rte 111).
