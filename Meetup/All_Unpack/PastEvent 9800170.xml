So, I thought I'd add it to our schedule after reading about their Sunset Hour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 4:30 until 6:30, Met Bar offers appetizer specials, which are $4 and cocktails for $6. I'll let you know whether they have draft specials. There's comfortable seating and even a fireplace to warm us.  So, join us for drinks and apps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://metclubandbar.com/bar/menu/" target="_blank"&gt;Met Bar Website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there when you're able and hang as long as you can, but if you want to save some dough get there between 4:30 and 6:30 for the specials. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the AMC theatre across the street is still showing Gran Torino, I'll be heading over there afterward, which should be around 7:30. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be shy ...Say hi. I'll buy a drink for the first new member who finds me. I'll be wearing a purple vneck sweater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to plan your public transportation route &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;five minute walk from &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Line (D) Chestnut Hill Station (FYI...this train ends at Riverside) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER - THANK YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the bar wearing a purple vneck sweater</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236294590000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235356307000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Drink Up While the Sun Goes Down on March 3rd</name><id>9800170</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236115800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/9800170/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/8/global_7423752.jpeg</photo_url></item>
