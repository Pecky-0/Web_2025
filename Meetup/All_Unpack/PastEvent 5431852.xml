It's high above  the surrounding towns and has a beautiful view of Boston and beyond.  There are miles of trails that  wind around the Charles River where you can enjoy the wildlife and the natural landscape.  Let's meet in the parking lot at 10:45 am and start the fun.  The park is located off the VFW Parkway behind the Home Depot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170777068000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169990820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking March Meetup</name><id>5431852</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170603900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/5431852/</event_url></item>
