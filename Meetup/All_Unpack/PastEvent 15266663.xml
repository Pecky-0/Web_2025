She'll show how the kit works and can be used at home without having to learn or buy a fancy camera. She will share tips and tricks to balance color and make your pieces sparkle. She'll also cover some key techniques if you have one of those fancy cameras. Then, everyone will have the chance to either shoot their work (so bring your digital camera) or Terri will take some shots for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring two or three pieces you'd like to photograph as well as your digital camera. If you don't have a camera, bring along a USB key so that you can take your pictures home with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This session runs 2 hours. We will supply busts, earring rings, etc.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lcanale</member_name><member_id>8176022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296328883000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288319705000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn to Photograph Your Own Jewelry</name><id>15266663</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296324000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/15266663/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/1/global_8989281.jpeg</photo_url></item>
