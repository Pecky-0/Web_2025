Feel free to pass this on to your friends and associates who may also be interested. This is part one of several series covering beginner topics and progress towards more intermediate topics. By the end of the series, you will have the skills needed to develop a fully functional web application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part 1 (The Basics)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anatomy of a web application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting up a development environment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basics of HTML&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basics of CSS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to PHP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hello World&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a hands-on series. Everyone will be expected to bring their laptop and work on the exercises. There will also be homework assignments. If you have been wanting to get started in building a website, or want to build a web application - then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sessions will be taught personally by &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/members/5046031/"&gt;Michael Bourque&lt;/a&gt;, who is the Organizer of Boston PHP. I cannot emphasize enough that this is for beginners. If you are already proficient with PHP and web development - then this event is not for you. Or perhaps you would like to volunteer to help. Let &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/members/5046031/"&gt;me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting ready for class&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please visit &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/pages/Boston_PHP_Beginner_Training_Series/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to learn about what you will need to get ready for class. This includes the latest info, as well as configuration of your laptop, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ensure we only get serious RSVP numbers, we are charging a very small fee of ($7). This will be used for venue/food/drink during the sessions. Please only RSVP if you are serious and plan to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The remaining sessions below have not been scheduled yet, but will be posted soon as well.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part 2 (Making it all work)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to databases and database design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building a simple application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Practices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debugging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part 3 (Adding pizazz)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basics of design and layout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with Images and Graphics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to JavaScript &amp;amp; jQuery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interaction development&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploying your application on a hosting service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sponsored by BeanTownHost&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/sponsor/3/d/f/0/iab120x90_75856.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would like to thank &lt;a href="http://www.beantownhost.com/"&gt;BeanTownHost&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring this event, and for providing web hosting for all attendees.
