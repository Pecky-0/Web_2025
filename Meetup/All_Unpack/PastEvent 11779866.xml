It's already hit other parts of the country like LA and NYC. So we're just going to help it along here. It's about time!! In New York everyone wears cool and stylish hats out. LA, too! But not so much here unless it's a Redsox, Patriots or the occasional Yankees cap. So... let's start a revolution here by putting on your best hat and joining me out at Bakey's for a pint. Then from there we'll head just up the street to The Littlest Bar, 25 Broad Street for a pint or two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THESE PUBS: &lt;br /&gt;They are some of my fave places in Boston. Bakey's reminds me of Edward Hoppers, Nighthawks. Nighthawks is a 1942 painting: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.o..." target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;. And, The Littlest Bar is a small and super friendly Irish Pub that at one time was in another local near by. Anyhow, they're both right on Broad St, which is only a short walk from from Faneuil Hall, Government Center, Beacon Hill or Chinatown. Your talk about a ten minute walk at most!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's All About The Hat: &lt;br /&gt;The classic flat cap, was first popular with 19th-century longshoremen and now with 21st-century celebrities, should be known these days simply as the Brad Pitt. However, over the years it has been called everything from the newsboy, the Jay Gatsby, the Big Apple, the Ivy, the eight-panel, even the Lundberg Stetson. And today the Brad Pitt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent and humorous occurrence while a few of us were visiting Manhattan:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;A woman in Prohibition (a lounge on the Upper West Side) took my hat off my head and placing it on hers asked, &amp;quot;Why are there so many people wearing hats here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Ha!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The woman in Prohibition: &amp;quot;No, really, why are so many people wearing hats?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Well, you know.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The woman in Prohibition: &amp;quot;No, why?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Well it's Manhattan. Everyone wears hats here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The woman in Prohibition: &amp;quot;That's right, it's Man Hattan!!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Ha!... Ha!...&amp;quot; (I felt like a fool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman smiled gives me back my hat and walks away.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Man Hattan&amp;quot; A new play coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's All About The Hat (continued): &lt;br /&gt;The elegantly casual newsboy is the cap most embraced by celebrities, regularly worn by luminaries like Robert Redford and other Hollywood hotshots including Brad Pitt, Terrence Howard, and Ashton Kutcher. Even George Clooney and Will Smith have had the good taste to wear newsboys on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;So You need a new hat? Challenge yourself. Be brave! Be Bold! Have fun! Make a statement! So what's your hat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here are some of my fave hat shops...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Village Hat Shop: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.villagehat.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.villagehat...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Goorin Bros: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goorin.com.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goorin.com...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hartford York: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.HartfordYo.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.HartfordYo...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Hat Shops in Boston:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Toppers &lt;br /&gt;151 Tremont St, Boston, MA &lt;br /&gt;617.859.1430&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;S A L M A G U N D I &lt;br /&gt;salmagundiboston.com &lt;br /&gt;765 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA  &lt;br /&gt;617.522.5047&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marchi Inc A Hat For Every Head in Boston &lt;br /&gt;1 Faneuil Hall Market Pl, Boston, MA &lt;br /&gt;(617) 523-1804&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best Hat Shop in Manhattan:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Village Scandal (East Village) &lt;br /&gt;19 E 7th St. New York, NY (btwn 2nd Ave &amp;amp; 3rd Ave.)  &lt;br /&gt;(212) 460-9358 &lt;br /&gt;Hrs: Sun-Wed: 12PM-12AM.
