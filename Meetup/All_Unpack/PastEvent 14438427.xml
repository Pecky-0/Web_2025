Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/rpga/downloads/LFR_CharGenGd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wizards.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week's adventures take us to Aglarond and Ravens Bluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGLA1-5 &amp;quot;Silver Lining&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;The commander of the Watchwall is looking for adventurers for a special mission into the Tannath Mountains. The Watchwall is always undermanned and the commander thinks he may have found some new recruits. But war, like politics, can make for strange bedfellows. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Aglarond for characters levels 1 – 4. This adventure is the beginning of both the “Invisible Road” and “Circle of Stones” Major Quests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINI2-1 &amp;quot;A Mourning of Ravens&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ravens Bluff has long been known as the City of Adventurers.  In spite of the changes to the city wrought by the Spellplague, Ravens Bluff still offers untold opportunities for adventurers hoping to make a name for themselves.  A new group of heroes are about to get their chance, when dangers from the city's past collide with the intrigue, greed, and pride of the present.  A Living Forgotten Realms adventurer set in Ravens Bluff for characters levels 1-4.  This is the first part of the three-part &amp;quot;Return to Ravens Bluff&amp;quot; mini-campaign.  For maximum enjoyment, it is recommended that you play the mini-campaign adventures in sequential order, using the same character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>11344282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282258258000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281976105000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms: "Silver Lining" &amp; "A Mourning of Ravens"</name><id>14438427</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282167900000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/14438427/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
