The meetup will hold at the Clear Conscience Café in Central Sq like usual. If there are too many people come and no seat left in the coffee shop, then I will try to negotiate with the grocery store manager to see if we can rent their community room at upstairs in the &lt;span&gt;back of the grocery store.&lt;/span&gt; So, if you come late and don't see us in the coffee shop, then please find us &lt;span&gt;in a back room above the grocery store.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will practice daily conversation in Mandarin. We may have Language Exchange in small groups if there are more than 10 people sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL LEVELS WELCOME!!! Feel free to bring books, course work, or anything you want to share with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
