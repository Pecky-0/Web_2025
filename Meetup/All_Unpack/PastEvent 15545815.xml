If you have a Greenland Paddle please bring it along and we can swap around and try different sizes and shapes. If you don't have a Greenland Paddle and would like to try paddling with one this is a good opportunity as well but you don't have to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event is open to all &amp;quot;sit inside&amp;quot; kayak types - No &amp;quot;sit-on-top&amp;quot; kayaks allowed due to reservoir restrictions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake Massabesic, a name derived from the Indians, meaning &amp;quot;the place of much water,&amp;quot; has a surface area of about 2,500 acres and a gross storage capacity of nearly 15 billion gallons. Two large ponds joined at Deer Neck Bridge on Route #28 Bypass comprise the entire lake. The so-called front pond, located on the eastern side of the bridge is within the town of Auburn while the back pond located on the western side of the bridge is divided north and south by the Auburn-Manchester town lines. Together they encompass about 28 miles of shoreline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Click on Photo to view Boat Launch Site Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Take Route 101 West to Exit 2 - Route 121&lt;br /&gt;* At bottom of exit, take left &amp;amp; go under bridge.&lt;br /&gt;* Continue for about 2 miles to stop sign.&lt;br /&gt;* Go straight through and continue for about 1/2 mile.&lt;br /&gt;* Boat ramp and parking is on right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Life vests aka PFDs must be worn at all times while paddling with this group.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Due to the water temps being cold &amp;quot;low 50s&amp;quot; and air temp below 40 a Farmer John/Jane Wet Suit or Dry Suit is strongly recommended or at the very least water resistant clothing pants/paddling jacket and synthetic layers underneath bring extra warm clothing as well&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a lunch &amp;amp; sport beverages or water to keep hydrated. Forecast is for temps to be in the mid 30s with a 10-15 mph Westerly wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=130+Chester+Rd,+Auburn,+NH+03032,+us&amp;amp;sll=42.999955,-71.344743&amp;amp;sspn=0.009557,0.016179&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=43.000096,-71.344635&amp;amp;spn=0.009557,0.016179&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=42.999771,-71.344618&amp;amp;panoid=fxoKySzLpG6cQQXS18hzwA&amp;amp;cbp=12,207.84310463698424,,0,5" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google Maps directions to Lake Massabesic Boat Launch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292263130000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290602628000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Skinny Sticks on Massabesic" Paddle from Auburn boat launch</name><id>15545815</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290963600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/15545815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/4/global_8386036.jpeg</photo_url></item>
