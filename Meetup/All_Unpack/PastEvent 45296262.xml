It's been a long time since Tool has been in downtown Boston and still it was almost 5 years ago when they were last in MA. I am happy to be the organizer for this event and connect people to one another. We can talk about good music over food and drinks before we head out to the show.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>3679170</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327943188000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324614678000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tool - TD Bank Garden - January 28th, 2012</name><id>45296262</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327791600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/45296262/</event_url></item>
