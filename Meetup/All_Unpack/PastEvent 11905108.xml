Daniel blends the traditional folk sounds of his New England roots with more contemporary rock and country influences to create an original, ear-catching, almost bluegrass finger-style acoustic work that is creatively his own.  Having toured the Northeast for a third straight year after the release of his home-grown debut CD &amp;quot;UNRESOLVED&amp;quot; in 2005, Daniel continues to do what he does best...making music, live performances, and recording.  Chauvin released 'BETTER PLACES,&amp;quot; his second CD in early 2008.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find his music very relaxing. See you at the show!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacki</member_name><member_id>6777705</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259026538000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258573311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Music at Tatnuck with Dan Chauvin</name><id>11905108</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258846200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/11905108/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/7/8/global_11879240.jpeg</photo_url></item>
