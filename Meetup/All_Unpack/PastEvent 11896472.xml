Reason #2: We can learn about the short count. Reasons #3 through 2011: The World is Not going to end. Reason # 2012: Please refer to reason #1. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sounds interesting and was originally posted as a note. Now I am converting it to an event. It will be a lecture on the Mayan calendar and the scientific explanations that go with it. They will more likely explain the world will not end so you will still have to pay your taxes. It is really a calendar of the precession of the equinox -- a cycle that takes 26,000 years to complete. And the reason why it didn't continue is that the Mayan who knew how to make the calendar probably died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is free and is in the Geological Lecture Hall at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. The lecture will be given by Marc Zender, not John Cusack. He is a Research Associate in the field of Maya Hieroglyphics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will meet you at the lecture hall and will be holding up 2012 MeetUp signs. Okay, I'll only hold up one. I will email my number to those who sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the event, I am heading to the Improv Incubator which is a group that practices improv. It is a group that accepts all levels and people are welcome to come with me. There is a $3 contribution for the room rental. Otherwise, people can go out for a drink or a bite after the lecture.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the lecture hall</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Giovanni</member_name><member_id>2402708</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259790031000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258485064000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2012 reasons to go to a 2012 Mayan lecture</name><id>11896472</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258669800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11896472/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/global_11868037.jpeg</photo_url></item>
