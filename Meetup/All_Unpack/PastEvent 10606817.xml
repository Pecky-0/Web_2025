But finally this past Friday I was able to catch them at the Harpoon Summer Session, and found out that there was good reason for all the good things I had heard.  They brought it all - soul, funk, rhythm and blues and a whole lot of groovin and shakin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for those that haven't seen them yet, or for those of you that just like to get down and get funky, let's&lt;br /&gt;meetup at the &lt;a href="http://www.cantab-lounge.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cantab Lounge&lt;/a&gt; in Central Square, Cambridge on July 2 and kick off the Fourth of July right with a funky groove!  Especially since many of us will have Friday the 3rd off form work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover charge is $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per my usual practice I will email my cell number to all Yes and Maybe RSVPs sometime the day of the event, likely by mid-day, so in case you can't find us, you won't get lost in the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge being what it is, parking is limited, but there are spaces on the street, and a few small lots around.&lt;br /&gt;Better yet, if you take the T, the Central Square Red Line stop is just a block away.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247268008000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Live Music Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Live-Music</urlname><id>1303540</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Mass Live Music n More</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244499415000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Chicken Slacks</name><id>10606817</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246582800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Live-Music/events/10606817/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/c/global_6395660.jpeg</photo_url></item>
