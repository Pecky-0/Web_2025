These films will not only entertain a global audience but will be judged by this wide-ranging group of film enthusiasts as well. Filmgoers will be handed a voting card upon entry and asked to vote for the one film they think should win. Votes are tallied at each participating cinema and submitted to festival headquarters where the winner will be announced in New York City on&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, October 3 at 10:00 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://msfilmfest.com/venue.php?region=Massachusetts&amp;amp;city=Brookline" target="_blank"&gt;http://msfilmfest.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brookline Coolidge Corner Cimema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 pm, following sharing impressions at Finale, or spot of majority's choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maia &lt;br /&gt;781-718-6203.&lt;br /&gt;Last year was great at MFA, and we chat after at Family restaurant in Brookline Village, thank to Jennifer!!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>10 min before start, will hold euro flag and keep seats</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maia</member_name><member_id>3083598</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285892030000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285460596000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MANHATTAN SHORT</name><id>14895984</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285887600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/14895984/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/9/global_18221449.jpeg</photo_url></item>
