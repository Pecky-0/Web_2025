The weather is supposed to be Sunny and close to 60, not bad as long as you layer up.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting at the Dunkin Donuts 1550 West Main Road, Portsmouth, RI  02871 at 1030am.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no set path of travel yet, ideas are welcome.  This is more of a get together meet some folks, and get some riding in type ride.  Its also a good warmup for Saturday's ride, to shake off the rust.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see some of you all brave the cold, get out and ride on one of the last rides this season, meet some people, and enjoy the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>GARY</member_name><member_id>4112809</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Navy CFL</member_name><member_id>8858593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288380180000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>West-Conn Sport Bike Riders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>west-connsportbikeriders</urlname><id>1535765</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>West-Conn Sport Bike Riders</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287945157000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oktoberfest - Friday Mid-Day Ride</name><id>15212215</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288362600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/west-connsportbikeriders/events/15212215/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/2/global_13926610.jpeg</photo_url></item>
