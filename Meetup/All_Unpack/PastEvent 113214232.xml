&lt;p&gt;What makes you happy? What experiences? What activities? Things? Thoughts? Think back time to you were happiest. What went into that? How have you made someone else happier? Come join your fellow Inquisitives, for a discussion of happiness. Bring a few experiences from your life to share with the group. Come learn, come explore, and perhaps just a little, come celebrate. We'll do this over a bit of brunch, coffee, tea and some adult beverages.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Inquisitive Minds Meetup, or for me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim B</member_name><member_id>1113365</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>37</waitlist_count><updated>1368236084000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365385372000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Happiness Project</name><id>113214232</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367168400000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/113214232/</event_url></item>
