Since this is a newcomers events, teams will be assigned just before the start. The search area will kept to within a 1 square mile to reduce or eliminate the need for cars roaming the city. Teams will be of 3-4 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items to be &amp;quot;scavenged&amp;quot; will be a photo of the item described in the clue. Every team will need to have one digital camera or cell phone with camera built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's how the hunt will work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I've tried to keep the hunt area small enough that it can be walked. I expect that over the course of the hunt a team should cover 2-3 miles. It is up to you to drive, but I hope it isn't necessary. The hunt area encompasses about 1 square mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Parking: I'm still work on the start and end locations, so I can't give parking advice yet.  Washington, Westminster, and Fountain are decent choices, as they'll be within a couple block walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Starting Location:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; I'll be there by 12:45. If you can, please arrive a little before 1pm so that teams can be assigned and the hunt can start as close to 1 as possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. What to Bring:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; If you have a digital camera, please bring it, and any cables that you need to connect it to a computer. I need to be able to see the photos and verify that they are indeed of target items in the hunt. To that end, I'll have a computer with to do that. If you don't have a camera to bring, that's fine, Every team will have someone with a camera on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Good Walking Shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Money, if you want to partake of refreshments along the way, or at our end location. Food will be available for order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; A sense of adventure and willingness to meet new people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Basic Rules&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teams will be 3 to 5 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Each team will need a name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Each team will need one camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; All scavenged items must be photographed on a single device. (eg: teams must stay together)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; If necessary, teams will be randomly chosen at the start area to encourage socialization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Scavenger Hunt ends at 4pm. If you haven't found the Finish location by 6:15, please call me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Each item on the hunt will be worth a certain number of points, the team with the most points will win the adulation and applause of the other teams, and a free round on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; If you become lost or need assistance, you will be able to call me during the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; There is no time bonus for finishing early, nor penalty for finishing late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; It may not be possible to get a photo of all items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Basic maps of the area will be provided that outline the search area and street grid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Scavenger lists will be distributed once teams have been formed and had a moment to introduce themselves to each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one who looks like a pack mule with computer and supplies...8)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263510544000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259187487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Downtown Scavenger Hunt</name><id>11956472</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263146400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11956472/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
