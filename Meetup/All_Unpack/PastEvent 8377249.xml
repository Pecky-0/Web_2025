The last time we ate here, we had a great turn out and many people enjoyed the food.  And at that time, they didn't serve alcohol but they had wine recommendations next to the menu items.  That gave us a laugh!  Let's see if they have their liquor license yet!  I love their Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Vindaloo.  This is a small restaurant so if you RSVP 'yes,' please show up.  Our events usually fill up and you could be taking the seat of someone who would like to attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's a small place.
