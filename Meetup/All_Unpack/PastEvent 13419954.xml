This year's festival is entitled: &lt;i&gt;Haiti: Expression Memories Rebirth&lt;/i&gt;, and the goal is to raise awareness and funds to help rebuild a school in Haiti that was destroyed in earthquake.  This school, which is called L'Ecole le Bon Samaritan (Good Samaritan School), has had a five year long relationship with the Metropolitan Learning Center.  L'Ecole le Bon Samaritan was founded by Jean-Elie Millien, formerly an Episcopal rector in Stamford, CT, and his wife.  The couple returned to their native Haiti for retirement and converted their Carrefour home into a school.  At the time of the quake, the school was serving 180 students.  In the aftermath, their close friends and colleagues Puck Purnell, an episcopal rector in Bloomfield &lt;a href="http://www.oldstandrews.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.oldstandre...&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife Joann Kimball, founded the Good Samaritan Rebuilding Fund &lt;a href="http://osa-haiti.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://osa-haiti.blog...&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poetry reading/art auction is just one of a week long series of events.  The art to be auctioned is the work of Metropolitan Learning Center Students. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other events include a choir performance Thursday at 4:15 and several documentary films being shown from 12:45 - 3:00 on Friday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;News clip on Puck and Joanne and their rebuilding efforts: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://mobile.courant.com/inf/infomo?view=latest_connecticut_news_item&amp;amp;feed:a=courant_1min&amp;amp;feed:c=latestconnecticut&amp;amp;feed:i=52554581&amp;amp;nopaging=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://mobile.courant...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet in the front lobby by the main office.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelly S</member_name><member_id>2538500</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273720791000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Arts  lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Arts-Cultural-Events</urlname><id>1343414</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Arts &amp; Creative Cultural Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273290225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Earth Shattering Poetry for Haiti and Art Auction (Global Ideas Festival)</name><id>13419954</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273701600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Arts-Cultural-Events/events/13419954/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/4/3/global_14890163.jpeg</photo_url></item>
