We welcome everyone, regardless of which winter holiday you celebrate, to join us for an evening of guided meditation and meaningful conversation, that will add depth and a spiritual dimension to your experience of this season. This class is a good one for those who are new to meditation and are wanting to learn. Experienced meditators will also find the class helpful, as meditating in a group lends support, energetically, and one can always learn to go in deeper. The type of meditation we practice and teach here is designed to bring you closer to experiencing God inside of you. Welcome all.&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Rev.
