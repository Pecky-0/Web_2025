Very few consider their spiritual heritage which is a long line of love beings who came before and who have set the way and a path before you to inspire, support, and love you into wholeness with God. These are beings who want you to strive for more love and fullness of life and who watch for opportunities to help you achieve these things. These beings experience this love and fullness of life in every moment and know that it is possible for everyone to experience it. They are therefore motivated to help others gain that experience. Join Mother Clare Watts, Christian master teacher, as she introduces you to a whole new world and legacy carried in your soul that will make you wonder where you came from after all! &lt;br /&gt;(Lunch included.)&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the speaker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare Watts is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 Centers of Light in cities across the country.
