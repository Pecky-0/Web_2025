We were thinking of maybe showing one or a couple short videos. Maybe start out with a little Penn &amp;amp; Teller on Creationism to warm things up and follow-up with some of PBS's special, Judgement Day: Intelligent Design on Trial (with Ken Miller who was present at the Creation movie event). It will be a pot luck affair. We will have some food, drinks, and probably a birthday cake for good ol' Charlie D. People are invited to bring their own Darwin beards if they feel so inclined. Here's &lt;a href="http://www.rps.psu.edu/edchoice/graphics/bee.beard.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, come join us in celebrating one of the most influential homo sapiens in homo sapien history.&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Darrick &amp;amp; Lindsay&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darrick Fauvel</member_name><member_id>2719698</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266198917000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264395301000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Darwin Day Celebration!</name><id>12414254</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266019200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/12414254/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/2/global_10991506.jpeg</photo_url></item>
