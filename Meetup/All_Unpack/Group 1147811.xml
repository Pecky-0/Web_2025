Come on by! We meet the second Tuesday of every month. &amp;nbsp;This month we met at the Library restaurant but next month, in February, it may be changed. &amp;nbsp;The date will certainly be changed as the second Tuesday of the month falls on Valentine's day. &amp;nbsp;Please stay tuned for more details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not read the book but would still like to visit, please &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;feel free&lt;/span&gt; to meet up with us anyhow. I get this question a lot. We would love to have you come on by and meet with us so you can get a good feel for the club. &amp;nbsp;There have been times when I have not finished the book! &amp;nbsp;Don't worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preceding our book club discussion will be a 15-20 minute discussion/reading from a touring author. &amp;nbsp;Click on the upcoming group meetup to discover who that author may be. &amp;nbsp;After this, we commence the book club in a round-robin fashion where each member discusses briefly what they enjoyed or disliked about the book. &amp;nbsp;Then we open it up into an open discussion. &amp;nbsp;Afterwards, the ones who brought selections for the next book club are offered a time to "pitch" the book. &amp;nbsp;We then do a democratic selection on the next book, thereby ensuring that only the participating members who went to the meeting are the ones able to pick the next book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;If you would like to take part in a meeting, please contact the organizer.&lt;/p&gt;
