<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The day after Thanksgiving is the best day for a pot luck. Everyone who celebrates it cooks too much of something. So bring your leftovers if you have them or something else if you don't (we can always use drinks, snacks and more games). Just make sure to bring yourself; someone has to eat all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner time will be somewhere around 5-7, but snacks and deserts will be eaten all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to bring (select all that apply ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games - We have plenty, but we don't have them all. &lt;a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/spamwolf?ff=1&amp;amp;subtype=boardgame"&gt;List&lt;/a&gt; of what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food (non-snacks) - We can refrigerate or heat whatever you want to bring. I will cook a main dish of some sort, but it won't be enough for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food (snacks) - If you bring it, it will probably get eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinks (non-alcoholic) - Sometimes everyone brings some; sometimes no one does. "You pay your dime you take your chances."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinks (alcoholic) - I'm not driving and we'll have plenty of room for those who want to crash, but we're not big drinkers ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs - We have seating for 26 or so.  If the RSVP count goes much higher than that you may want to bring your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donations&lt;/strong&gt; - We will have a donation box in the entryway, please use it.  We put a lot into these events, and we can use all the help we can get.  Any other items you want to leave behind will also be appreciated: chairs, serving utensils, and other such items that make these events possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other - We always have cups, napkins, plastic-ware, but feel free to bring anything else you like as long as it doesn't get anyone in trouble with the law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel/Parking: Parking - I live close to the beginning of the street, so at soon as you make the turn start looking for parking. Most of the parking in the area is resident only, but I will have parking permits by the front door for everyone to park on the street. We have a driveway that can fit 3 tandem if everyone noses up, so please pull all the way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Train - we live 6-8 minute walk from the back exit of Alewife (exit in the direction the train comes from). Just walk in the direction of the park (if you see an overpass, you're going the wrong way). When you come to a fork in the trail take the middle path. Clay street is a strait shot from there. Turn left at Clay and we are on the left in a brown building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bus - nearby is the 350, 77, 79, 83, 87, 88, 89&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me if you have any questions at all. Ben 617-997-3545&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I have a gas stove/oven, a crockpot, a microwave, and a fondue pot if you want to bring anything that needs heating up. Just give me a call to make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353705118000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351623724000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Infamous Leftover Pot Luck at Ben's</name><id>89208542</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353693600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/89208542/</event_url></item>
