We'll hike up the Yellow trail to the tower and back. The first part of the Yellow trail is steep so we'll take it slow. Other than that steep part, the hike is good for everyone! The hike is anticipated to take about 1.5 hours and we should catch a beautiful sunset from the ridge if weather cooperates! No meal is planned after the hike but this could change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 557 acres with hiking trails on Talcott Mountain and beautiful views from the mountain of 1,200 square miles. A 165 foot tower sits at the top (won't be open though). The state website says the park is in Bloomfield but the bulk of the park with entrance road and tower are in Simsbury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet at the parking area near the Yellow tailhead (Tower trail) on the park road off of Rte. 185. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs on a leash are permitted in picnic areas and on hiking trails. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions&lt;/b&gt; to meet at park:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Simsbury&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=50+Summit+Ridge+Dr" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail map&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/talcgis.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more park information&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&amp;amp;q=325272&amp;amp;depNav_GID=1650" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
