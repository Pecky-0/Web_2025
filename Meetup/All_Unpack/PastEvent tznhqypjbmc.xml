Suite Fran√ßaise tells the remarkable story of men and women thrown together in circumstances beyond their control. As Parisians flee the city, human folly surfaces in every imaginable way: a wealthy mother searches for sweets in a town without food; a couple is terrified at the thought of losing their jobs, even as their world begins to fall apart. Moving on to a provincial village now occupied by German soldiers, the locals must learn to coexist with the enemy -- in their town, their homes, even in their hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.mobipocket.com/eBooks/cover_remote/ID115/1400096278.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the table closest to the cafe door.
