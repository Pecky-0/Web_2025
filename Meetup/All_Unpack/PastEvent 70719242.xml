&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a Logical Choice, since the Weather is suppose to be in the 80's &amp;amp; we will be near the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Bay Bike Path, seems to be everyones favorite.  Very scenic and very flat. If you have never been on it, why not give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance to Bristol is about 13 miles.  I like to go thru Colt State Park, to add a few extra miles.  There are Restrooms, at Colt State Park.  We probably will split into a few groups.  Feel free to go at your own pace and whatever distance you feel comfortable with. You can always turn around if you start getting tired.  I am sorry, but unless the turnout is small, I will not be able to watch everyone.   If you were wondering, I plan to ride non stop to Colt State Park.  There take in the Views and some snacks, then head back.  Depending on how I feel, I may ride to Providence.  If you need some hill training, there is another  hill heading to Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is no Confusion, we will wait on the Bike Path, where you turn to go to Colt State Park.  Then, we will head into the Park, for our Break.  It is about 12 miles, to where we will Meet-Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions:  Route 95 to Route 195 East, take Exit #4 /   the exit forks, stay Right Riverside /  follow Veterans Memorial Parkway  and you will see a Large Parking Lot on the Right.  I am not sure if the street # is 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
