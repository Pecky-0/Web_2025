It's alright if you're a beginner because at 7:30, the lessons start.  Usually, 2 or 3 line dances are taught during this 1 hour lesson.  At 9pm, the band starts.  Count on several hundred people every Saturday night and continuous dancing for 5 hours (7:30-12:30).  Just the excitement of watching the band and skilled line/couples dancers is worth the trip!  Plus, it feels like you're at a huge house party...A place where eveyone eventually knows your name.  We will meet at 7:30 to get a table.  Come later if you want.  Check out the details, driving directions, and all the photos on their website (midnightrodeobar.com).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:    Midnight Rodeo Bar at The Yard in Manchester, NH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:     Saturday, March 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrance:  From parking lot, you'll see the plexiglass cold-weather canopy.  Enter there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once inside:  Put your coat at the table directly to the right of the wall-mounted TV and join us on the dance floor.  We sit at that table or stand next to it to talk periodically throughout the evening.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn line and couples dances:   2-step, Waltz, El Paso, Carolina Stroll, 3-Step, 16-Step, Tush Push, Billie, Cheeseburger, Trashy Women, Shadow, 1-Step, Boot-Scoot-&amp;amp;-boogey, Cotton-eyed Joe, etc., etc. (not all in one night!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open at 7:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover charge $10.00 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dance Lessons 7:30 - 8:30pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobby Carlson and the Stones River Band  9:00pm - 12:30am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stones River sounds like what`s happening today and a little of yesterday. A wide variety of country music with a flair of rock. Stones River`s influences stem from Tracy Bryd, George Strait to Sugarland to Dolly and you might even hear a little Delbert in the mix!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since your feet slide on the dance floor somewhat when doing this kind of dance, sneakers won't work too well.  Leather soles or just slippery soles (even if they're slippery sneakers) work best.  I will gladly instruct/lead some of the couples dances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tall guy with glasses</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268094688000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267400296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live country music and dance - Midnight Rodeo Bar at The Yard in Manchester, NH</name><id>12736796</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267921800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/12736796/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/c/f/global_7601071.jpeg</photo_url></item>
