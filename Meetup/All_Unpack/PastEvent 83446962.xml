&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poll this month was a dead tie! It looks like people want to read both books, so we will be reading one in November and the other for December. For November, why don't we read The Name of the WInd, by Patrick Rothfuss! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 From Amazon: &lt;span&gt;This is the riveting first-person narrative of Kvothe, a young man who grows to be one of the most notorious magicians his world has ever seen. From his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;is a masterpiece that transports readers into the body and mind of a wizard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones and across the street from Orleans restaurant. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Josh&lt;/p&gt;
