<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's been too long since we've had a meetup at Musquash so with Beau's legs doing better I decided to set one up!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go to the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; location on Hickory Hill Road.  Park at the end of the street and meet under the power lines right before you enter the woods.  Let's keep the dogs away from the street so others enjoying the trails aren't overwhelmed. :)  Also, make sure to have poop bags on hand in case any doggies go on the trails.  It's also a good idea to have some orange on the pooches since it's hunting season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trails we'll do this day should take from an 1.5 hours to 2.  They took Beau and I about an hour and 20 minutes the other day so in a group it's usually a little longer.  We can definitely rest anytime anyone wants to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone there.  Beau (and I) have missed the group BIG TIME!  :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet under the power lines before trail head entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291594564000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291386582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Musquash Sundays Returns!</name><id>15630626</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291563000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/15630626/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/3/global_13504099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
