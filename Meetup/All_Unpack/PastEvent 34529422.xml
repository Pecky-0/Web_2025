This is a restaurant I dined at quite often in the early 2000s when I visited friends in the neighborhood. The food was amazing then and according to Manoel it is still delicious.&amp;nbsp;Check out the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cafebrazilrestaurant.com/our_cuisine.html"&gt;Cafe Brazil menu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portions are large, service friendly and attentive and the price is right. Beer and wine are served and music begins at 7 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available in the&amp;nbsp;Sherwin Williams lot across the street (416 Cambridge Street).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before I list the Reservation Rules, please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it will be fairly and strictly enforced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well, you have transportation issues, you don't have the money, you just don't want to be around people or whatever the reason. My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules for Events with&amp;nbsp;Reservations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is less than an hour from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST contact me by calling or texting me at&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(617) 445-7549&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;or email at snowrover@yahoo.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All RSVPs are on a first reply, first reserved basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the dinner is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP and your answering the RSVP question .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the dinner and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I change you're RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update dinner confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within an hour of the dinner, without contacting me, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://portuguese.meetup.com/316/suggestion/"&gt;Tonya&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about rejoining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so please, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will arrive at 7:15 PM to confirm seating and welcome you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text my cell (617) 445 7549</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320472839000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316685761000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cafe Brazil Dinner and Music</name><id>34529422</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1320449400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/34529422/</event_url></item>
