Carl was a Professor of Astronomy and Space Science and Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University, but he is most known for being a Pulitzer Prize winning author and the creator of the TV series COSMOS. One of Carl's book, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark is an essential read for any good skeptic and should have a permanent place in their library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your stories of how you came to know about Carl and his work. If you don't know much about him, just come and find out more over drinks and snacks with us. We'll have some material that will help to highlight Carl's life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;** Please RSVP on the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Lowell-Area-Skeptics-Society/calendar/15190569/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLASS Meetup event page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. **&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darrick Fauvel</member_name><member_id>2719698</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289089299000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288557269000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Carl Sagan Day (GLASS event)</name><id>15288396</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1289084400000</time><rsvp_limit>1</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/15288396/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/0/global_19296976.jpeg</photo_url></item>
