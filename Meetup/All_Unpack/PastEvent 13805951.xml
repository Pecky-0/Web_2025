The Man Who Fell to Earth 
Directed by Nicholas Roeg. 
With David Bowie, Candy Clark, Rip Torn 
UK 1976, 35mm, color, 139 min.

David Bowie stars in Nicholas Roegâ€™s melancholy fable of a shipwrecked alien who disguises himself as a human in order to find his way home to his wife and family. Adrift and lost on Earth, the lonely space traveler has little to protect him from the forces of capitalist materialism, the banality of a televisual society and panoptic government authority. 

The Rotten Tomatoes site gave it an 86% and the following comment:
Consensus: Filled with stunning imagery, The Man Who Fell to Earth is a calm, meditative film that profoundly explores our culture's values and desires.

Here's a description from the IMDb site:
Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth to get water for his dying planet. He starts a high technology company to get the billions of dollars he needs to build a return spacecraft, and meets Mary-Lou, a girl who falls in love with him. He does not count on the greed and ruthlessness of business here on Earth, however. Written by Gene Volovich  

Here's a link to a NY Times review dated May 29, 1976 around the time of release:
&lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04EFD6123BE334BC4151DFB366838D669EDE" class="linkified"&gt;http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04EFD6123BE334BC4151DFB366838D669EDE&lt;/a&gt;

Although Sci-Fi isn't one of my usual genre choices, this movie sounds interesting and has a dramatic component.  It also sounds relevant to today's social climate.  

After the film, we'll go to a local eatery for refreshments and discussion.  Hope you can make it.
No need to RSVP if you are NOT going to join us at the restaurant afterwards.
