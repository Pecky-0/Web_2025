I am planning to cross a few people off my list after this event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visited this club early this year and the grounds are beautiful.   The landscaping is amazing.  It is not only a Portuguese restaurant. In fact the restaurant is a very small part of this club. The grounds contains several function halls, a bar, a gym, outdoor patio, and even a shrine with a waterfall/river dedicated to the Lady of Fatima.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just sign-up and I will take of the reservation with the club.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************************** &lt;br /&gt;Experience a &amp;quot;Taste of Hudson&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The Riverview HPC proudly presents a Special Luncheon featuring Appetizers, Entree and Dessert Samples from our newly released cookbook.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Taste of Hudson, a collection of recipes from the Hudson, MA Community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cookbooks will be on sale for $20.00   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.riverviewhpc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;[url= www.hudsonportugueseclub.org] www.hudsonportugueseclub.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.riverviewhpc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.riverviewh...&lt;/a&gt;[/url]&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260292186000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258604425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portuguese Cookbook Luncheon Event</name><id>11909762</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260118800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/11909762/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/c/global_11884844.jpeg</photo_url></item>
