From its beginnings, photography has been lauded as nature capturing itself and as a method with which to stop, pause, preserve, and contemplate time. Artists include Stuart Allen (TX), Erika Blumenfeld (TX), Rebecca Cummins (WA), Sharon Harper (MA), Chris McCaw (CA), Matthew Pillsbury (NY), Byron Wolfe (CA). In creating their work, each artist uses a different idea or aesthetic means to capture time—Pillsbury, for example, might leave the shutter open for a whole television program, while Harper travels across the world and records skies on a single sheet of film. Other artists use important celestial markers, like equinoxes, or human markers, like conversations at a cafe, to bookend their exposures.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a purple flower pin.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cristin</member_name><member_id>603739</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227220715000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222273218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Keeping Time: Cycle and Duration in Contemporary Photography--Opening Reception</name><id>8823869</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226012400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/8823869/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/6/f/global_5633487.jpeg</photo_url></item>
