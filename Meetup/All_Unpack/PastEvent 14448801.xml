<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Seth has graciously opened his house to the Rhode Island Atheist Society for dinner and a movie on Friday, September 10th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be viewing Monty Python's &amp;quot;Life of Brian&amp;quot;  and partaking in spaghetti and turkey meatballs that Seth is also going to prepare.  I thought it might be nice if the rest of the participants could volunteer to bring bread, salad, or dessert to round out the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're capping this event at 20 people so please respond early to save your space - and let us know if you would like to contribute to the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions - hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will email the address to participants several days prior to the get together.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284514042000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Atheist</urlname><id>12929</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282053903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society - Movie Night!</name><id>14448801</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284159600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Atheist/events/14448801/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/0/global_13237216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
