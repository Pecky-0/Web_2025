&lt;p&gt;For over 50 years, the Brettl-Hupfers have kicked off ski season the weekend after Thanksgiving at one of the many mountains close to our lodge. We will be back at it this year so come on up and join us for the weekend. Attitash is less than 2 miles away and Cranmore, Wildcat, and Bretton Woods are only a short drive. Most area mountains will be opening the day after Thanksgiving so drive up on Black Friday, welcome the beginning of winter and go skiing with the Brettl-Hupfers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the ULLR bus will make its voyage around the valley in the morning, bringing with it the traveling Viking Olympics. The 3rd annual Idiotarod race will be held on the frozen Brettl raceway at 2:30 p.m. For directions and full details of the weekend, please sign up. It is $20 per person, per night to stay as a guest. All guests must be 21+. Bring your friends!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sara Hickson</member_name><member_id>7424991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353726412000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352479165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ullr Fest Weekend</name><id>90685312</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353715200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/90685312/</event_url></item>
