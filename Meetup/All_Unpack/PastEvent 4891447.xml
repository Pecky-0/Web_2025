<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is an easy 2.5 mile hike that includes a relatively scenic view from the summit of Lookout Mountain (744 ft.). Portions of the trail include the Shenipsit Trail. This forested hike started out as a Boy Scout hike I was recently asked to cover and I decided to open it up to the Meetup Group too. I expect only a small number of scouts attending so there won't be any crowding or distractions from the beauty of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is anticipated to last 1.5 hours and rise 350 feet. Overall the hike should be done at about 9:30 AM. No lunch plans are included in this hike. No online trail map is available. A map can be found as hike #6 in the &amp;quot;50 Hikes in Connecticut&amp;quot; book by the Connecticute Forest and Parks Association.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this hike is Kevin S so please direct questions on the hike to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Hartford:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-84 E to I-384&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 4 off of I-384 (Highland St.)&lt;br /&gt;* From the end of the Exit ramp, right onto Spring St.&lt;br /&gt;* Go about 0.2 mile to small parking lot at the bottom of the hill on your left.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1144671360000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1144039668000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike to Highland Springs and Lookout Mountain in Manchester CT</name><id>4891447</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1144497600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4891447/</event_url></item>
