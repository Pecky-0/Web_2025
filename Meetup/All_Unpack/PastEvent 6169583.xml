In addition to their wonderful food, awesome draft beer selection and interestingly international wine list, they also display works of local artists, including a variety of media and photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional information, directions and photographs, see &lt;a href="http://www.jamessgate.com" target="_blank"&gt;James's Gate Restaurant &amp;amp; Pub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: For those folks using public transport, the No. 39 bus goes right thru the center of JP, down S. Huntington Ave and Center Street. James' Gate is just off South Street, approx. 4 blocks south of where South Street forks left off Center Street. Any additional questions re: directions, please call James' Gate directly.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193781364000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186964771000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>JP Pub Crawl #2</name><id>6169583</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193439600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/6169583/</event_url></item>
