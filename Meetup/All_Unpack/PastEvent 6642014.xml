And, for the guys, Alexis says one year a hot violinist played a solo in a bikini.  Ok, that can be for the girls too, I don't judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot buy tickets at the door for this, you must buy in advance, and it usually sells-out, so if you're interested...go buy now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheapest way to buy is at the &lt;a href="http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_boxoffice.php" target="_blank"&gt;Shubert Box Office&lt;/a&gt; (no surcharges).  Next cheapest is by calling Shubert Theater (203-562-5666) (some fees, less than online though).  Or, buy &lt;a href="http://www.capa.com/newhaven/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We WILL be in costume!    :)    Alexis &amp;amp; I will be at the &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/calendar/6641948/?from=list"&gt;Toad's Event&lt;/a&gt; before this.  If you're not going to Toad's, we can still manage to meetup &amp;amp; sit together, just text or call me around 11-ish so that when I arrive at Woolsey (11:40?) I can tell you where I am or find out where you are.  Though if you call, just leave a message, I probably won't attempt to answer the phone while in Toad's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOST: &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/members/2254163/photos/"&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt;, cell 203-901-4957&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POST-PARTY: Nothing says Halloween like going to a diner in costume, and this might even happen.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194061764000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193722748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wed 10/31 - Midnight multi-media extravaganza at Yale</name><id>6642014</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193888700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6642014/</event_url></item>
