If  you have been reluctant to attend because you didn't think you could keep up with a group this week offers a great opportunity to come out and meet some of the regulars.  Depending on who attends I plan to run 3-6 miles at an 11:00-12:00 minute pace.  Hope to see some new faces that wanna go easy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically we all run at our own level, hopefully as the weather turns nicer we will grow to a point  where we have several groups running together at a comfortable pace.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Easy to spot the group...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Cummings</member_name><member_id>4930656</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240922201000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237579181000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pier 1 - Sunday Run</name><id>9998070</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240749000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/9998070/</event_url></item>
