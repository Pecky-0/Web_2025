That's 25 oz! They also have pitchers which we can share! There is no pressure to eat if you sit near the bar at the &amp;quot;long group table in the bar area with stools (which can accommodate a large group). Delicious appetizers and bar &lt;a href="http://johnharvards.com/downloads/Menu-Cambridge.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is available here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important Note: If you are interested in ordering flights...plan on getting there early. It takes time to prepare the &amp;quot;flights&amp;quot; so if some of you can show up earlier ( in order to stagger the service) that will alievate processing time for our flight orders.  Since they fill up fast on Saturday, expect delays after 5PM . If anyone can help by getting there by 4:40 PM, please grab a stool at the giant pub table in the bar. Late arrivals, except ldelays on ordering flights. Pitchers of beer are readily available.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be seated in the bar area at the long group pub table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>25</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271710871000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270825143000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RAINY DAY ?????Beer Flights @ John Harvard's Brewery of course!</name><id>13134525</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271537100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/13134525/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/c/global_14233068.jpeg</photo_url></item>
