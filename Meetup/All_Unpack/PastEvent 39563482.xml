&lt;p&gt;Make the Red Line on the MBTA completely Red! Wear Red and carry anything that is Red. This requires minimum commitment and effort which is perfect for the Red Sox Natives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at 5:45pm at Washington and Summer Streets at Downtown Crossing Red Line Station and look for people wearing Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Start from Downtown Crossing Station (Red Line) at 6pm. There should be a bunch of people around you, all wearing Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Fill the train (the last coach) with people wearing Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.Get off at Harvard Square. And&amp;nbsp;head to the nearest pub with your new friends for a drink and&amp;nbsp;to plan more flash mobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to bring your friends, kids, parents, red heads, neighbors, co-workers, other groups,pets, pugs... -just make it a normal train ride wearing Red because it's the Red Line and&amp;nbsp;you are the Red Sox Natives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told that there are hundreds of people RSVPd for this with other groups!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
