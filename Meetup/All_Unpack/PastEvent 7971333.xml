Combustible Celluloid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Welles' baroque border-town murder mystery is a wild masterpiece, a sleazy, grimy, jittery, and ultimately dazzling work of cinematic magic. Seattle Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the commercial disappointment and political controversy of Citizen Kane, Orson Welles was never given another opportunity to make a film with an entirely free hand in the United States. Touch of Evil was as close as he came...it's a strikingly constructed, visually audacious film that's also a great piece of popcorn entertainment.The justifiably famous opening shot -- a long tracking sequence that opens with a man planting a bomb in a car and ends with a newlywed Mexican DEA agent (Charlton Heston) and his bride (Janet Leigh) crossing the border -- is only the most spectacular bit of visual stunt work in this film; Welles seems to have having a grand time with his camera, and in its way this picture is just as visually exciting and inventive as Citizen Kane.This film is the work of a great artist having a lot of fun telling a good yarn, and it's wildly entertaining while still delivering the kind of excitement that only a real artist can deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Touch of Evil&lt;/b&gt; was released in 1958 and  brutally cut by the studio. This restoration (1998) is  based on a 58-page memo written by Welles after he was barred from the editing room during the film's original post-production  All Movie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to a complete review, including a couple of paragraphs of how this film was butchered in its original release:  &lt;a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/1998/0998/09188.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.chicagorea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is one for &lt;b&gt;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/1689_CAT_ON_A_HOT_TIN_ROOF" target="_blank"&gt;http://onfilm.chicago...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row at the end of the film and then we'll go to a nearby restaurant to discuss.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213046300000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211242651000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Orson Welles Touch of Evil</name><id>7971333</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212873300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7971333/</event_url></item>
