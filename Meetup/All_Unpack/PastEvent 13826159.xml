<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I've finally settled on the 2-day AT hike for June 26 - 27. We are going to skip about 6.3 miles from the last place we ended in VT northbound on the AT to allow a better 2-day hike. We'll go back another time to fill in that  missing part.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The AT hike will be in VT and going over Killington Peak. This is the 2nd highest mountain in VT and the highest AT elevation in VT. The section we will do will be from Route 103 to Route 4, northbound , about 17.5 total miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first day, we have an altitude gain of about 3,000 feet over about 11.1 miles. We will stay in a stone/wood shelter (Cooper Lodge) near the peak (alt. 3,850 ft.) that sleeps 12 and also has tenting platforms that can take up to 10 additional. I believe this is the highest shelter anywhere in VT to boot! We will need to bring tents as there is a very good chance the shelter could be full. GMC (Green Mountain Club) runs the shelter and this one does not take a fee per the GMC website (&lt;a href="https://www.greenmountainclub.org/page.php?id=54" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.greenmoun...&lt;/a&gt; ). There is a privy there. No fires allowed due to sensitivity of area at altitude.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second day we'll take the short side trail and ascend about 300 feet to the peak of Killington Peak. Then it is mostly down with roughly a 2,600 ft altitude loss over about 6.4 miles to the end on Route 4.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think I'll limit the party size to 7 people to fit in one van for transport back. But I could extend to 10 people max. if enough people want to go and we arrange a second shuttle from end to beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, and individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike and may necessitate backup plans if any member of the party runs into significant issues or if there are weather related issues that spring up. I have been conservative with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonable fit, experienced, and equipped we should come in earlier than I estimated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES ==&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Full pack&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable, &amp;amp; broken in&lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks&lt;br /&gt;* Layers of cloathing -Avoid cotton as it stays wet (this includes underwear).
