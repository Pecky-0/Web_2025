The hike may be short but the start will be a lot of exertion as we ascent over 300 feet fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start out In the Giuffrida Park parking lot and hike past the dam for Crescent Lake. This part may be a little wet as we have to cross below the dam where the trail crosses the spillway. Then we hike up the steep side of the ridge and climb only an easy 15 feet or so of traprock. The path to climb like steep stairs. The reward is great though as at the top, on Chauncey Peak, is a WONDERFUL vista!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail follows the cliff edge to the north with a great view of the lake below and Lamintation Mtn. on the other side of the lake. The views get more natural and lovely as we follow the ridge. Eventually, as we get past the lake, the trail will cut down steeply from the ridge line. There is no climbing, but you need to watch your step lest you slip a little on leaves, dirt, or scree.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path continues by the side of the lake with a pleasant walk through the old evergreens with a few benches at lakeside and back to the parking lot.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will take up to 2 hrs. for this hike as we make deep appreciation for the vies from the cliffs and lakeside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go need to have:   &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - You need your hands free  &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water - MUST bring!   &lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate footwear - hiking boots are the best  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to the *unmarked* park entrance can be found via MapQuest:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Meriden&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=801+Westfield+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=06450-2553&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.555428&amp;amp;longitude=-72.760759&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chauncey Peak is near the northwestern end of the Mattabesett Trail system. A good map can be found in the &lt;i&gt;Connecticut Walk Book&lt;/i&gt;, 19th Ed., in either the East or West editions, as map MB-8b as published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link provided below takes you to a topographic map of the area centered on Chauncey Peak.
