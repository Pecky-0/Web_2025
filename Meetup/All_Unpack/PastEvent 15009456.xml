The Woods offers over 30 miles of scenic trails for hiking, running, horseback riding, mountain biking (not allowed during the winter), cross-country skiing, and nature walks. Three active reservoirs provide pretty pond-like scenery among natural forestland, as well as clean water for the City of Lynn. Dungeon Rock is a well-loved underground tunnel with a history of pirate lore and treasure seekers. The Rose Garden, Houghton Horticultural Garden, and Amphitheater areas provide more formal settings to explore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The City of Lynnâ€™s Department of Public Works, Park Commission, and Lynn Water and Sewer Commission share jurisdiction and management of the Reservation. The Park encompasses nearly one-fifth of the entire land area of the City and represents a significant natural, watershed, and public recreational resource in eastern Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynn Woods Ranger&lt;br /&gt;Dan Small Phone&lt;br /&gt;Fax&lt;br /&gt;Email 781-477-7123&lt;br /&gt;n/a&lt;br /&gt;LynnWoodsRanger@aol.com&lt;br /&gt;Rules and Regulations &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOURS: Sunrise to Sunset. For your safety and the protection of the woods, the reservation is closed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIKING: You must stay on officially marked trails only.  Official trails will have a colored paint blaze and are on this map.  Take the time to learn the layout of the trail system so that you will not accidentally ride on an illegal or closed trail.  If it  isn't on the map it isn't an official trail.  Biking is not allowed on the trails marked &amp;quot;foot traffic only&amp;quot;.  Responsible riding will help protect the forest and the future of biking in Lynn Woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HORSE-BACK RIDING: Riding is permitted on orange blazed fire roads only.  Please do not run horses or ride on the hiking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOG WALKING: City Ordinance for restraining dogs is in effect throughout the reservation.  Owners are responsible for removing waste from trails, roads and parking lots.  Pets are prohibited from entering in or upon reservoirs due to the potential for contaminating our drinking water supply.  Poop pollutes:  Waterborne diseases such as E.coli, Camphylobacter fetus and Crytosporidiosis are caused from fecal contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWIMMING: No swimming or boating is permitted in any of the reservoirs in the reservations as they are all used for Lynn's drinking water supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRES: No fires are allowed, except by permit.  Fire has been a major threat to the forest in Lynn Woods.  In order to prevent future fires from destroying the woods, we cannot allow grills, stoves or fire to be lit without a permit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FISHING: Fishing is prohibited due to the impact on the water supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROHIBITED: Camping, paintball, ATV and dirt bike riding are prohibited due to the safety and conservation concerns.
