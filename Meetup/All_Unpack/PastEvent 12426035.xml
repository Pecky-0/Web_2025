Here is a description from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Birth order is important in terms of how it affects your personality. Find out how you are influenced whether you are first born, middle, last, twins, an only child, as well as other unique orders. Find out what options you have to balance what mother nature dealt you and how to relate to others of different birth order.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269042500000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264489090000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Birth Order</name><id>12426035</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268438400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/12426035/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/8/global_7203288.jpeg</photo_url></item>
