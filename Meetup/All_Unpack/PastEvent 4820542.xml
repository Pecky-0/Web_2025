So bring your DUES as well as comments, suggestions, and wishes for what our group can do for you in the coming year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cafe on the Corner is on the west side of Central Avenue/Route 108, just south of the railroad tracks. It's on your right if you are driving south from Spaulding Exit 9; if you are driving north from a prior exit, you will have to turn left on or make a U-turn at the traffic light at Third Street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park in front of the Cafe on Central Avenue, around the corner on Third Street, or in a free municipal lot off of Third Street (next to the bank, across from the Strand cinema). Come on in and look for the Meetup sign on the table . . . or just listen for us! We try to claim a spot in the back of the main room, where the couches are, but seating is first come, first served. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Angulo</member_name><member_id>789593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Francophones</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastNHFrench</urlname><id>63967</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Seacoast NH French Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1135252972000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seacoast NH French Language January Meetup #2</name><id>4820542</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1137628800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastNHFrench/events/4820542/</event_url></item>
