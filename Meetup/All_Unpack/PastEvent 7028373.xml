After RSVP-ing to the meetup online, contact a coordinator for your region.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each region needs 20+ people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will partner up to distribute pro-life literature to church-goers at the end of their service, as they drive out of the parking lot. This has been done successfully by other groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WE WILL NOT WEAR Ron Paul gear and WILL NOT HOLD Ron Paul signs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quick and easy work. You will be at each location for less than 15 minutes most likely. Each team will be assigned 2-3 church services. The coordinators have the church list and will be getting details on timing over the next couple of days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can work Saturday evening, let your coordinator know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will try to match people up with churches near their homes. If you already have a partner, let them know. If you need to be matched up with someone they will do that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PLEASE help with this! This is crucial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coordinators:&lt;br /&gt;Seacoast:  Liz - liz (at) keyelementdesign.com&lt;br /&gt;Manchester/Concord:  Mike Malloy - 215-913-1183&lt;br /&gt;North Country: Harry Harrison - 603-703-7785&lt;br /&gt;Keene Area:  Doug Bershaw - 239-8827&lt;br /&gt;Concord Area: Lisa Blake - 414-839-4060&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't get a response from your coordinator, please contact Mike Failla at (603) 724-0320&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199804677000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199428155000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pro-life outreach</name><id>7028373</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199631600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/7028373/</event_url></item>
