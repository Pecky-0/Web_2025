She is the author of This One Tree, winner of the 2005 New Issues Poetry Prize, judged by William Olsen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In This One Tree, I find what might very well be the salvation of our distracted, disbanded American soul: an imperative, unempirical Gaze. Peterson commends and then commands Vision in her every word, beginning with her first onesâ€”'Be on the lookout.' And what I find most wonderful of all is that, here, Vision goes forward to atonement and a new name in 'sweet alyssum' for us all.&amp;quot; -Donald Revell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jericho Brown worked as the speechwriter for the Mayor of New Orleans before receiving his PhD in Creative Writing and Literature from the University of Houston.

His poems have appeared in The Iowa Review, jubilat, New England Review, Oxford American, and several other journals and anthologies.  His first book, PLEASE (New Issues), won the 2009 American Book Award.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273189018000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272979226000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jericho Brown and Katie Peterson at Pierre Menard</name><id>13379375</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273015800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/13379375/</event_url></item>
