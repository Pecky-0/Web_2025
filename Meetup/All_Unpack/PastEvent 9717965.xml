Sorry about that.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, does your would-be valentine &amp;quot;really value your friendship?&amp;quot; Ladies, did you open your card and find a one year membership to Planet Fitness? Well, come get it off your chest the old-fashioned way - kill somebody!&lt;br /&gt;...or be killed. Whichever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These parties are a real blast, and the trippy thing is you arrive in character, so the people you've never met before get to meet your character first. Respond by Feb 12th to receive a role as one of our charming murder suspects, or perhaps the lucky guest of honor...the victim. Sign up any time after the 12th to be one of detectives and figure out &amp;quot;whodunnit.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should go a couple hours. Afterwards, hang out with a new crew, or head back to Keys to arrive fashionably late for Andrea's B-day party. Very fashionably, if you're dressed as the millionare heiress mysteriously widowed six times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The contact for this event is Lori Larson, owner of Look At Me Now, the site of the event. 203-933-2200&lt;br /&gt;You'll need to contact her to sign up for a role and handle the $25.00 payment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because roles need to be pre-assigned, &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; responses have been disabled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details from her site: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/MURDERMYSTERY/calendar/9318811/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first and second murder mystery went beyond fantastic. We had so much fun, we thought we'd do it again. Our next gala is sure to out do the last. I encourage you to rsvp early as we have limited characters available. You cannot rsvp maybe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So put on your crazy outfits and step out of reality for a while and let go of your worries. &lt;br /&gt;There will be prizes awarded for best costume, best sleuth, best actor/actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call Lori to register 203-933-2200&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235434051000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234320948000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Murder Mystery Party</name><id>9717965</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235260800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9717965/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
