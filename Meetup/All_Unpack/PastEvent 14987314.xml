We just found out that hunting season begins on October 12th so this Saturday will be our last of the season.  If you'll be around over the holiday weekend and would like to join us, we'd love the company.  I'm picking a route that offers great scenery, maybe even a little foliage, maybe even an elusive otter, but not too long for mid-afternoon.  We'll meet at the parking lot on Upper College Pond Rd. at 2 pm and head out, bisecting the Bentley Loop on a variety of wide and narrow trails through fields and woods and by ponds with a short stretch on-road.  Bring your cameras and cross your fingers for some great shots.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286746270000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286145053000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Minute Hike on Saturday</name><id>14987314</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286647200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/14987314/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/2/e/global_18449678.jpeg</photo_url></item>
