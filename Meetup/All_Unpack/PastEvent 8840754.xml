Since we plan to be a much smaller group than Monday nights at Borders, we are focusing on non-party games.  Our first meetup for example we played San Juan, Acquire, Yspahan and ended with Coloretto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is Windham?  About 15 minutes from exit 2 off the Everett Turnpike (Rt. 3) and about 10 minutes from exit 3 or 4 off Rt. 93 (Windham borders Pelham, Hudson, Salem, Londonderry and Derry).  We plan to rotate hosting duties in this area from week to week (last one was in Londonderry).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please use the back door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff M</member_name><member_id>4602649</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223930541000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Gamers</urlname><id>393834</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Greater Nashua Gamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222463040000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Windham</name><id>8840754</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223416800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/events/8840754/</event_url></item>
