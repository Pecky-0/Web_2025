&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

February 12th &lt;br /&gt;

11am-4pm&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Join us as we host our annual Chinese New Year Festival in celebration of the Year of the Dragon. To welcome the Year of the Dragon, a variety of Chinese performances will be taking place throughout the day. The Youth Music Ensemble from the Greater Boston Chinese Cultural Association will start the festivities with a concert of traditional Chinese music. Students in the group will also introduce the beautiful instruments they play. A team from Yang's Martial Arts Association of Andover and Boston will perform the traditional Chinese Lion Dance. Students will also participate in a martial arts demonstration to show off their skills. Although it is the year of the dragon, what do we really know about these creatures? Educators from Rainforest Reptiles Shows will help answer this question with their program "Dragons-Fact or Fiction?"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Families will have the opportunity to join in the festivities. Fold a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;hongbao&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, red envelope, to share good wishes. Play&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;tangrams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a traditional puzzle game. Make a dragon puppet and join in our dragon dance. And much more!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/text Yooree 201-743-8574</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yooree Losordo</member_name><member_id>7915117</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329138373000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328225417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chinese New Year Festival @ Boston Children's Museum</name><id>50805202</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329062400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/50805202/</event_url></item>
