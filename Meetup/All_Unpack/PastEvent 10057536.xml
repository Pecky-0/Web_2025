Come on out &amp;amp; join us for drinks, food (if you wish) &amp;amp; good conversation  and company at the Horseshoe Pub.   This place has a great selection of beer for you beer lovers.   There is plenty of FREE parking an NO cover charge.    As always, everyone pays for their own food &amp;amp; drinks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If everyone wants afterwards, we can head to Speakers CLub in Marlboro only if everyone wants more of a club setting versus pub.    See you tonight!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a rust/orange colored knit shirt</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>brenda</member_name><member_id>6787148</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238631042000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238268503000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>3/28 - Sat night Last Minute meetup at the Horseshoe Pub in Hudson, MA</name><id>10057536</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238290200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/10057536/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/f/global_4486527.jpeg</photo_url></item>
