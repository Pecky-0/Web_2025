Ok, TMI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not to mention...I just love this band!  and after a Friday night at the "hoe down" I'm gonna have to get the low down, and fire it up with WILDFIRE baby! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfire plays a great variety of tunes, mostly rock 'n roll from my era...of course I'm only 49 (again).  They start about 9-9:30. there is a $5 cover...don't recall what time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be there for dinner at 7-7:30, so if you get there before me,  I'll have a reservation for us, under "susan/meetup". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In your reply tell me if you're coming for dinner.  I've made a tentative reservation for 10, and will doublecheck in a day or two.  I would just ask that the people &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;who make a dinner reservation take the reserved table&lt;/span&gt;, and I will try and get booths nearby for those not eating, or coming later to dance, (and who probably won't need a seat anyway), and someone can have my seat after dinner, as I'll be up on the dance floor with them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, NO need to reply "no" I have enough emails to deal with, ty ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to "meetup" with YOU soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top of the day to you,&lt;/p&gt;
