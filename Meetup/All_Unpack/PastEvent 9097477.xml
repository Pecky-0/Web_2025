Ask anyone who came to Alexis' Obama music fundraiser, this opera singer will blow you away!  He has performed all over the world, and now for you he will sing famous tenor arias...if you liked &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Tenors"&gt;&amp;quot;The Three Tenors&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, you will like the pieces chosen for this concert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST:&lt;/b&gt; A donation is requested...they're hoping to raise funds with this event, for Daniel.  He has been invited by the famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_Caball√©"&gt;Montserrat Caballe&lt;/a&gt; herself to compete in her international opera competition in Madrid, which is a huge opportunity for him.  However, he needs money to be able to afford the trip.  You can always listen to him first &amp;amp; decide whether to donate and how much afterwards. I expect you'll be so impressed you'll really want to help him get to Spain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;POST-PARTY:&lt;/b&gt; Ya never know, we may end up hanging-out after for food/drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear Alexis playing some Mozart at her site: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist"&gt;www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; Alexis, cell 203-747-9203.  However she will be very hard to reach on Sunday so you can also try Jason, 203-901-4957.  You MAY get her, and you may have better luck with texting her than phoning, but she's teaching in the afternoon then warming-up for the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt; For directions, click &lt;a href="http://www.branfordefc.com/directions.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226444900000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225868113000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sun 11/9 - The One Tenor</name><id>9097477</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226271600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9097477/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
