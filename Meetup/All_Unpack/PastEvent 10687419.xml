The Partnership's acclaimed training programs teach professionals of color how to create opportunity---and leverage it into positions of power. The Associates Program trains young professionals develop their leadership capacity by creating professional and civic opportunity in the early stages of their careers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Wilkins will keep with the topic chosen and give a dynamic presentation on how to be an &amp;quot;Impact&amp;quot; player at work and how to stand out as a leader in your chosen field!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great event for members who are laid off and trying to figure out how to stand out in the growing sea of displaced workers. This is also great for members who are happily employed, but who want to make sure that their skills and expertise are visible to their higher ups, who may have to make tough lay-off decisions down the line.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope many of you can attend!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qiana  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: May 21, 2009 6:00 PM  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where: District Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge  &lt;br /&gt;180 Lincoln Street  &lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02111  &lt;br /&gt;617-426-0180&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Qiana Christian</member_name><member_id>5933597</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250807345000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>businessnetwork-960</urlname><id>1253532</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Professionals of Color Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245410861000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Professionals of Color Business &amp; Social Networking Group July Meetup</name><id>10687419</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247781600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/businessnetwork-960/events/10687419/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/global_5310243.jpeg</photo_url></item>
