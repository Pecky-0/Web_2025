This is the first D&amp;amp;D program that Wizards has designed specifically for weekly play. &lt;br /&gt;An ongoing mini-campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D&amp;amp;D Encounters is set up with an ongoing narrative element, played as a mini-campaign lasting a few months. Each mini-campaign is also known as a season of play; after one season finishes, the next one begins the very next week, without interruption. The season is divided up into 3 chapters; each chapter is composed of a few sessions of play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fitting D&amp;amp;D Encounters into a busy schedule is made much easier with its one encounter per week sessions. You can get the encounter done within 1-2 hours, making it easy to finish at a reasonable hour and keeping the DM?s prep time minimal each week.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>2523881</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269124361000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267978764000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Encounters</name><id>12807555</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268863200000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/12807555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
