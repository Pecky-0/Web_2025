It will be more of a walk in the woods than a serious hike as we'll cover 2-3 miles of rolling trails, likely with views of Rainbow Reservoir. Meet in the parking lot at 2:00 and expect to be out on the trail 1-2 hours at a social (slow) pace. Kids and dogs welcome.  It may snow on Sunday, but unless it's raining or blizzarding, I'll still be there.  Check back that morning to see if I have updated the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
