Explorers have been seeking entrances for centuries, but there have been no leads... until the map was located just days ago. Will you brave the tunnels, find lost treasures, battle hidden foes, and be the one history remembers as the greatest of explorers? Come join us for an evening of table-top adventuring in this Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure for ages 6-10, 11-15 and 16+ (tables grouped by age).  Fee: $5 for members and their friends, $10 for nonmembers.  Feel free to bring snacks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275850556000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274904706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Night: The City Below</name><id>13604859</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275690600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/13604859/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/e/global_6162670.jpeg</photo_url></item>
