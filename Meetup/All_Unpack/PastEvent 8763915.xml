Recently I've received a handful of emails asking if I plan to do one this fall. I thought about and decided it was high time I got drunk with all'ya'all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start at the Burren at 2pm with the complete route and times sent to all RSVP'd participants. We'll stop for pizza and trivia. Cost is $10 per person and covers the gourmet pizza stop and beer. All other drinks and food during the day are pay as you go. We will try to see if we can get a liquor company to sponsor the day like the last one. If anyone has connections let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be a few days before Halloween. Dress up is not mandatory but encouraged. I'd also strongly encourage comfortable shoes and warm clothing. Sure Halloween, is the one time of year you can get away with a mini skirt showing off a sexy hot pink thong in six inch Stiletto's but trust me unless you plan on Tequila shots at 2pm it's gonna be too cold for your Britney Spears pre-comeback costume. On that note, we'll be giving away prizes for costumes and trivia. The last crawls trivia theme was &amp;quot;Boston&amp;quot; this years trivia theme will &amp;quot;Halloween&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP today so we know if there is enough interest to continue to organize. Also add ANYONE to this evite over 21 you think would have a good time, can drink and remain cool and has superior Halloween trivia knowledge. - You know the cool kid in the back of the bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to invitation on meetup site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/422/calendar/8759384"&gt;http://socialnetwork....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Pubcrawl Photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/eaconway/sets/72157606017150848"&gt;http://flickr.com/pho...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Girls night out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/eaconway/sets/72157606515774829"&gt;http://flickr.com/pho...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Eileen &amp;amp; Robin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evite.com/pages/invite/viewInvite.jsp?event=MLSXUCAXHIXFXEAFUGDZ"&gt;http://www.evite.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Not sure what I'll be wearing .. but I'll have comfortable shoes on.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225510162000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221517324000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Social Event: I can't believe it's Fall Crawl!</name><id>8763915</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224957600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8763915/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/d/global_5528237.jpeg</photo_url></item>
