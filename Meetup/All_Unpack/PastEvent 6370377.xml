IT'S SPOOKY TIME!  &lt;br /&gt;HALLOWEEN!  SCAREY PUGS!  COSTUMES!  CANDY CORN!  &lt;br /&gt;PRIZES, PRIZES, PRIZES! &lt;br /&gt;CUTEST!   MOST CREATIVE!    BEST OVERALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to dress the Pug!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a brand new venue for our October meetup! John and Cindy and Zoe have invited us to their home in Halifax - rumor has it that John fenced the yard just so that he could host all of Zoe's little friends!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a quiet street with plenty of parking.  We hope to see you all there!  Please bring folding chairs.  The group has grown big enough so that there probably won't be enough resident chairs to go around...    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluids will be provided, but now we are counting on our various meetup members to bring the goodies - since they've already been doing a bang up job of packing the table with tasty treats for Pugs and owners alike.   It isn't just the Pugs who stuff themselves at these meetups... your faithful organizer manages to go home with an extra pound or two on board every single time!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT FEED CLOVIS!  He has a damaged brain stem and has trouble swallowing.  Imagine a Pug who has trouble swallowing!  (Okay, you can feed him bits of soft food broken into tiny pieces... are you happy now, Clovis?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetup is on the SECOND Sunday of October.  See you then!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty people and a veritable MOB of Pugs poured into Michael's back yard for the September meetup, but there was more than enough room to hold everyone.   Stoney, my French Bulldog wants everyone to know the snacks were outstanding - he sampled just about everything - as well as the doggie treats.  Several new people and dogs showed up - among them, Dudley the speed demon and Sir Edward, the Puggle, who TOWERS above the Puggies, but no one seemed to mind, least of all Edward!  Puppies Homer and Sophie arrived for their first meetup - Homer hit the ground running, but Sophie took some time to warm up.  However, when she realized thirty people had showed up just to pet her, she was ecstatic!  Puppy Templeton was there too, he has doubled in size - and in attitude too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who couldn't come, we have live action!  Check out the Puggie videos at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mlebarron" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Michael and his fiance for making their home and their marvelous fenced yard available to all of our Puggie friends.  We'll  be back! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful time was had by all, and we hope you will be able to attend the next meetup! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192557894000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189969736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug October Meetup</name><id>6370377</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192384800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/6370377/</event_url></item>
