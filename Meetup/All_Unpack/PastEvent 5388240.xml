<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Lydia would like to host a play gourp/impromptu get together with kids in&lt;br /&gt;Newton on the MLK holiday Monday at about 4pm. The forecast is&lt;br /&gt;for rain, but if it's not raining we live across the street&lt;br /&gt;from a park, and if it is raining we'd love to have kids over&lt;br /&gt;for a playgroup &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I can send my address to anyone who RSVPs). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My (Lydia's) son is 3.5, but kids of all ages would be welcome, and anyone&lt;br /&gt;who doesn't have their kids or has no kids but wants to meet&lt;br /&gt;other group members would be welcome to come too! Look forward&lt;br /&gt;to meeting some of you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lydia&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1169067997000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168618259000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Impromptu--playgroup in Newton on MLK Day 4pm</name><id>5388240</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168894800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/5388240/</event_url></item>
