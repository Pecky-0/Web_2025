Tallamy will speak about the importance of native plant landscaping to our beloved native birds and wildlife. He is the author of &amp;#147;Bring Nature Home: How Native Plants Sustain Wildlife in Our Gardens&amp;#148; and University of Delaware professor and of chair of the Entomology and Wildlife Ecology department. This lecture will take place at the Newbury Elementary School on Saturday, April 7 at 10am. This is a free program. Because our yards and gardens are part of the terrestrial ecosystems that sustain humans and the life around us, it is essential that we keep them in working order. Tallamy will discuss the important ecological roles of the plants in our landscapes, emphasize the benefits of designing gardens with these roles in mind, and explore the consequences of failing to do so. Gardening in this crowded world carries both moral and ecological responsibilities that we can no longer ignore. Please join us!
