Lets go check out an nice little airport with a very newly paved runway!  It has painted stripes and everything!  We can even work off our meal with a short walk back from the snack shack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.navmonster.com/map/KFIT-0B5-10" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.navmonster...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0B5 Turners Falls has a nice little Take-out and Ice Cream place called &amp;quot;Country Creemee&amp;quot;.   It stays open until 9 pm each night.   When you fly in, you'll need to park at the FBO that's midfield on the west side.  It's then just a 3-4 minute walk up the hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you'll find an assortment of take-out diners and ice-cream.   Picnic tables are located outside.  Not sure if there is indoor seating.   If you park at the north end, you'll be faced with a long walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the runway has just been repaved.    If landing on RWY 16, you'll have to back taxi because no taxiway at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Bortle</member_name><member_id>6715847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282257136000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268014745000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Country Creamee, Dinner and ice cream at the falls</name><id>12812710</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282167000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/12812710/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
