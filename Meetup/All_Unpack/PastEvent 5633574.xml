It's an invigorating climb up to the summit.  It'll get your heart going but is doable for the average walker.  The views from the top are beautiful.  We'll have lunch after for those interested.  See you then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot located on Rte 138 in Milton. &lt;br /&gt;It's the same lot used for the ski area.  The easiest way to get to this location is via Rte93/Rte 128 - take exit 2b Rte 138 - Milton.  Go thru one intersection and approximately 1/2 mile on the right you will see a large parking lot.  See you all there.  Please note there is no entrance charge for this walk - only a $1.00 Fee payable to the organizer.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178636860000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175623871000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup</name><id>5633574</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178463600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/5633574/</event_url></item>
