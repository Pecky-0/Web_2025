When can a music video be considered art? Come to this event and decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirrorball #2 | Animation (2006, 67 min.) The most creative, twisted industry minds bring you both delightful fairytales and disturbing nightmares. The Go! Team blast onto the screen in director Goodtimes' colorful, dance-fuelled dynamo of a video. Watch in awe as hundreds of ink paintings morph and melt into dream-like perfection in Smog's &amp;quot;Rock Bottom Riser.&amp;quot; Up-and-coming director Motomichi Nakamura succeeds in his aim to &amp;quot;express pain in suggestive ways&amp;quot; in his stylish yet alarming video for The Knife's &amp;quot;We Share Our Mothers' Health.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this screening doesn't start until 8:30, we will be meeting before the movie this time to get a quick dinner or snack together of wraps and/or smoothies at Boloco (a short walk away from the MFA).  This event is being hosted by Nicole, who will have a meetup sign at a table in the Boloco. In addition, the 'yeses' and 'maybes' will receive an email prior to the event with more information about how to find the group. Around eight, we will head off to the museum to view the music videos with the possibility of going somewhere afterward for discussion. Tickets are $8 for students/MFA members/seniors and $9 for everyone else. A series pass for is $20-24 for all four Mirrorball screenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event should be a great way to look at other forms of art and learn about bands in the indie rock scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related websites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Go Team - &lt;a href="http://www.thegoteam.co.uk/flash/GoKids.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thegoteam....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review of Smog's Rock Bottom Riser EP from Pitchfork - &lt;a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36918/Smog_Rock_Bottom_Riser_EP" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pitchforkm...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motomichi Nakamura - &lt;a href="http://www.motomichi.com/home.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.motomichi....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Knife - &lt;a href="http://www.motomichi.com/home.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.motomichi....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171757063000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170851595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mirrorball, the Art of the Music Video: Animation</name><id>5460413</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171584000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5460413/</event_url></item>
