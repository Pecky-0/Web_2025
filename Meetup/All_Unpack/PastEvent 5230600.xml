Ahh!, so its a doc about something good being done! The director and some of the stars will be present, although I can not vouch for the dogs. I  admit that I have a penchant for the  &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; documentaries and I like dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres is the capsule from the MFA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prison Pups by Alice Dungan Bouverie (2006, 58 min.) follows four inmates as they raise and train service dogs for the handicapped and hearing impaired. At Concord Farm, a minimum security facility in Massachusetts, these inmates learn to take on the responsibility of caring for a puppy and find in themselves, a capacity for nurturing and affection. The empowerment they experience in their role as trainers is profound. Discussion with director and stars follows screening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is $9 and please note that this film is only 58 minutes in length. The film starts at 2:40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, I will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row and then we will go to a local cafe.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1162841524000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162143933000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Woof!
