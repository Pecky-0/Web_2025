 &lt;br /&gt;and degrading, sometimes loving, but sometimes mean and judging. How those
 &lt;br /&gt;conversations come to us is interesting but what we do with them is of the most
 &lt;br /&gt;importance. Did you know you can retrain those voices? You can change a negative
 &lt;br /&gt;into a positive in seconds. There is a quote that I love, "If you think you can do a
 &lt;br /&gt;thing or you think you can't do a thing, you are right." The truth of this statement is
 &lt;br /&gt;you create your reality with your thoughts. Even the little ones, even the quiet ones.
 &lt;br /&gt;Knowing this is the key to making a change in your thoughts and in your life. Join us
 &lt;br /&gt;for an evening of change.
