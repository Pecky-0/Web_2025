But we were wrong! Several people have expressed interest in starting right away, so we are obliging by offering a new class series beginning Tuesday, December 15th, at 7:30 pm. The title of the series is Meditation and Christian Mysticism. If you have wanted to learn how to really meditate and are curious about what mysticism is and how it is practiced in the Christian tradition, then this class is for you!&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful introductory course designed for those who are seeking to experience God inside themselves through meditation. Mysticism refers to &amp;quot;the practice of knowing the reality of God through direct experience.&amp;quot; It is certainly nothing new, as it has always been at the core of every religion and represents a more inner, experiential way of coming to know God and the spiritual world. We offer this series as an opportunity for you to discover whether the mystical path might be right for you. Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation (beginning with a guided meditation at the beginning of each class) that will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome, no matter what your previous experience or religious background may be.&lt;br /&gt;The class is free, but RSVP is required. Late admittance may be permissible (after the first week of the class), but check with the organizer to be sure. Completion of this series can lead into more advanced classes for those who are interested.&lt;br /&gt;The class is offered on six consecutive Tuesday evenings at 7:30pm, December 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***PLEASE NOTE: There is ONLY STREET PARKING at the Center of Light. Please do not use our neighbors' parking lots, as we do not want you to get towed or locked behind a gate overnight. There is plenty of easy parking to be found on the street on our block. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
