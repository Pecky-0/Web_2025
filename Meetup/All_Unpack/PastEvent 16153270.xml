Buffett and I are going to head out to the forest after our weekend errands for some fresh air and exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll park at Parking Lot 2 near the Bentley Loop and follow some of the trails we took last October toward New Long Pond.  If conditions are good for snowshoeing, I plan to bring mine along.  If not I'll just hike and will use some sort of 'treads' if there's ice on the trails.  Trekking poles are supposed to be good for a full body workout and would also help if conditions are slippery.  Buffett's on his own whatever.  We'll decide when we get there if the week's weather hasn't made the choice obvious and might be able to combine hiking and snowshoeing if we can agree to adapt our speed to suit the group as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan to use trails and old roads and maybe Lower College Pond if it hasn't been cleared and offers a suitable surface.  Distance will depend on conditions and group choice allowing for tiring if we're battling snow or ice.  Plan on 1-2 hours.  I won't have a chance to go out before that day so will have to plan as we see the conditions and decide on snowshoes or not.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296906476000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Note:  The meetup place is Parking Lot 2 on Upper College Pond Road.
