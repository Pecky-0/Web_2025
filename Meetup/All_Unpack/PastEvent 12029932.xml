Winter is finally here. Yesterday we had our first real snow storm, and given that I am still under the weather... I did not have the chance to enjoy it too much...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life continue to be hectic at times, but God is good. Overall I cannot complain. I am really looking forward to seeing you on December 13, at 4:00PM...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, mark your calendar:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TIME: December 13, 2009 at 4:00PM&lt;br /&gt;PLACE: PEACE ABBEY - Two North Main Street, Sherborn, MA 01770&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We continue our reflection on MATTHEW FOX's book: &amp;quot;ONE RIVER, MANY WELLS&amp;quot;. CHAPTER FOUR: &amp;quot;RELATING TO THE FUTURE, WHAT THE DEVINE IS ASKING OF US&amp;quot; (377-421). Just to let you know, that we have already chosen our next reading material: &amp;quot;The Inner Experience: Notes on Contemplation&amp;quot; by Thomas Merton. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We contionue to be enriched by the presence of each other... by our common sharing and reflection.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all on Sunday - December 13, at 4:00PM.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blessings on you and your family and may heaven enable us to be bridge builders rather than obstable makers...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PEACE&lt;br /&gt;Fr.
