Please be there by 8:30 if you want to play.  That's when they ask for $ and team names.  They won't accept more than 5 per team so if you show up after the game has started we might be full.  They're pretty strict on the rules at Anna Liffey's. &lt;br /&gt; *******NEW RULE: If you're not there by 8:30, you won't be able to play with the NHC teams.  I've decided not to hold places for people.  Seating is too hard to come by*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start thinking up those dirty team names!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie is the contact for this event 512-413-4119 (fyi, trivia is in the basement so reception is pretty lousy. Also you're not allowed to have your phone out during the quiz so after 9 we'll be unreachable.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185491017000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184680116000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia Time!</name><id>6035615</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185318000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6035615/</event_url></item>
