There are lots of guys like J.J. Giddes (Jack Nicholson). They're easy to find...if you want to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all begins for gumshoe Giddes when a well-to-do dame walks into his office. Sure, it's happened before, but nothing has prepared J.J. for this broad or for this tale of political corruption, adultery, murder, and....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, nothing has really prepared anyone for this hard boiled tale, which is one of the reasons why it endures. Expertly scripted by Robert Towne and masterfully directed by Roman Polanski (&lt;span&gt;Rosemary's Baby&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span&gt;Chinatown&lt;/span&gt; cemented the career of Jack Nicholson and easily became one of the top ten films of all time. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards (though only winning for script;&lt;span&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;/span&gt; is pretty stiff competition, after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a trip back...to &lt;span&gt;Chinatown&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'll be in Panera from about 5.45pm to 6.15pm and will then head across to the Coolidge to get in line.  We'll meet in the lobby after the movie and some may like to go to Otto's for a drink and pizza.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
