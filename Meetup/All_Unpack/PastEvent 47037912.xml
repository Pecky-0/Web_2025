&lt;p&gt;We will have a discussion on narcissistic abusers and on consequences of those relationships. They appear charismatic and smooth-talking to their friends but are EXTREMELY abusive to their partners and cause DEEP, SEVERE abuse and trauma. They act like they are better than you and are always name-calling. They destroy your self-esteem and treat you like garbage. A talk on this would be helpful to build up our self-worth again. We invite all abuse survivors to participate in this discussion. Many professionals feel that all abusers are narcissistic. But... there is that special group of males and females who are "certifiable" narcissists. Either way, they cause pain with no regard to how their words and actions impact others.&lt;/p&gt;
