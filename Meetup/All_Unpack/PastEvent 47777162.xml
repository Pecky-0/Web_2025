This is an opportunity for those that are new to the Liberty movement to introduce themselves, learn more about Dr. Ron Paul and his stance on the issues. Learn about volunteer opportunities such as; attending sign wave events, door to door canvassing / yard sign distribution, phone banking, setting up a table or booth (i.e. local college campus), helping to get people registered to vote for the upcoming Republican primary to be held in Massachusetts on March 6, 2012. (voters need to be registered Republican by February 15, 2012 as this is a closed primary state). Lets continue the momentum from the 2nd place finish for Dr. Ron Paul in the New Hampshire primary. Hope to see some new faces on Tuesday.
