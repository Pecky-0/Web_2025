Use this opportunity to practice most common relaxation exercises in a warm, supportive group atmosphere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This week's topic: Emotional Awareness and Regulation &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to events that we perceive as stressful we are likely to feel a range of difficult emotions which may make us act in maladaptive ways. Emotional awareness and regulation are one of the most important skills you may need to manage stress. During this session we will talk about the physiology of an emotional response and ways in which you can become aware of your emotions and manage them in a way that is most effective for you.  We will do two relaxation exercises: mindfulness meditation and a visualization exercise (focusing on emotional experiences).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emilia</member_name><member_id>1728643</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249135569000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>whole-living-center</urlname><id>1384267</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Whole Living</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248120784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Emotional Awareness and Regulation</name><id>10917747</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248534000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/whole-living-center/events/10917747/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/5/global_7333733.jpeg</photo_url></item>
