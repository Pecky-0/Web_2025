We ate here on 3 years ago and were blown away!  Fantastic food, terrific ambiance, and service with a smile!  The prices are very affordable considering the decor and taste of the food.  The sake is out of this world!  Please check out the website and join us as we enjoy some of the best sushi I've ever tasted!   Can't believe it's been so long - really want to go back!&lt;br /&gt;The reservation is under Betsy/Ethnic Dining.  Hope you haven't already made plans for next week - see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://minghungcuisine.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://minghungcuisine.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://minghungcuisin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was enough interest, si I increased the size of the reservation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will collect $1.00 from attendees to defray costs of running this meetup.  Please RSVP responsibly (if you say you will be there, please show up). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy</member_name><member_id>3384225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288899658000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288228560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Min Ghung Asian Bistro</name><id>15254179</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288825200000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/15254179/</event_url></item>
