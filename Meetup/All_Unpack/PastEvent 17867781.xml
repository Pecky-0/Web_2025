Viewing his beliefs as those of a "conscientious cooperator" -- and not an "objector" -- the combat medic bravely rescued 75 wounded men from the front lines without any weapons to defend himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All donations will be given to support the Center on Conscience and War.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306092895000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305050572000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup for May - The Conscientious Objector</name><id>17867781</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/17867781/</event_url></item>
