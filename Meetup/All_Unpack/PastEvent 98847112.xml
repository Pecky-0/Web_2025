<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I heard poker mentioned at the last game night so throwing this out there to gauge interest. Everyone could bring some food and we can play No Limit Texas Hold Em. This meetup would be for those who are at least familiar with basic game play. You can google how to play poker if you're a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with some practice rounds and then play for bragging rights. We can decide if we want to do a small cash prize for the winner, maybe $3 to $5 each. Location would be my house near Franklin Park Zoo, Blue Hill Ave. side. I'll email the directions ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cabral Thomas</member_name><member_id>9824758</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363486525000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>businessnetwork-960</urlname><id>1253532</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Professionals of Color Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357785544000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Poker Night - House location - new date</name><id>98847112</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363474800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/businessnetwork-960/events/98847112/</event_url></item>
