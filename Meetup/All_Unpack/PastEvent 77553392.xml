I'd like to continue to explore the area, maybe something shorter like east on Gulf Road, north on Paine Swamp going up towards Doanes Falls, then along Lawrence Brook and back down to Gulf via Gales Hill. I could get an afternoon off this week (any day but Tuesday) if anyone's up for a little adventure. I have maps and a GPS so how lost could we get?
