We need to continue to be visible and for our family, friends, and allies to be visible and stand up with us. We had 300 people lobbying last April, lets double that number. Even if you legislator is a co-sponsor come in and help others to lobby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please call now and make appointments to meet with your State Representative and Senator on 1/21/09.
