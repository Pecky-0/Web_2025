The plan is to go to Mt. Sunapee Saturday February 7. I'll be driving from Somerville but might have a full car already. It takes an hour and a half to two hours to drive up there, so we can meet up in the lodge at 9am if that seems like a good time to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the lodge at 10am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill_J</member_name><member_id>4839704</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234568684000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233571300000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mount Sunapee </name><id>9652279</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/9652279/</event_url></item>
