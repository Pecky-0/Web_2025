The Hartford Courant calls it the best kept secret in Hartford - large portions of good polish food for small prices.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is plentiful in their own lot.  It is an older building that doesn't look like a restaurant, but is a &amp;quot;Hidden Gem&amp;quot; according to Metromix.  I don't know anything more about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like good food at good prices to me, and of course we will all find good company at our table to share the good times with.  I will collect $1.00 from attendees who wish to contribute toward the costs of running this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! - Betsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, if you RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; - PLEASE SHOW UP!!  Anyone who changes their RSVP to &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; less than 48 hours before the dinner will be considered a NO SHOW, and 3 no-show's will automatically terminate you from our group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation under "Betsy/Meetup"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy</member_name><member_id>3384225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1237418901000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234557522000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>POLISH NAT'L HOME 03/04/09 7:00pm</name><id>9737148</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236211200000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/9737148/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
