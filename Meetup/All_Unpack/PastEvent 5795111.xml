<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 8 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 8:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;* Take I-691 East and get off at Exit 5&lt;br /&gt;* At end of ramp, turn left onto Route 71 North&lt;br /&gt;* Go 1.5 mile and turn left onto Butler&lt;br /&gt;* Next left onto Park Dr.&lt;br /&gt;* Hike is a half mile on the left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/directions via Yahoo Maps (MapQuest couldn't seem to find it) for meetup location:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/broadband#mvt=m&amp;amp;q1=500%20park%20drive,%20kensington,%20ct&amp;amp;trf=0&amp;amp;lon=-72.821352&amp;amp;lat=41.56847&amp;amp;mag=3" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.yahoo.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
