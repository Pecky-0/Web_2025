This is really cool because it is normally closed to the public! Our own P-Collective Member, Christopher is leading the tour!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providence Water will be revisiting the Tunk Hill peninsula of the watershed forest property for its third and final field tour of 2012. The focal theme of the walk will be ecosystem health and factors that can affect it, including white-tailed deer, non-native invasive plants, and climate and weather events. The hunt is now in its third season on this part of the property. We will visit some deer exclosures and talk about how they are used in monitoring changes in vegetation. Stops will include white pine and oak stands where we will discuss how overabundant deer impacts. We will also see a variety invasive plants and talk about different approaches to managing them. In addition, we will visit a historic cemetery and fire tower where we can discuss past settlement and land use, and walk to the edge of the Scituate Reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
