Thank you, Karen! Your effort made my day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go from 10 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m. There's a minimal cost for the workspace ($25), which we can divide among those who show up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of location, this is a terrific venue. It's easy to find from the Mass Pike, Route 9 or Route 30. There's plenty of free parking. There are literally a dozen restaurants nearby where we can get takeout for lunch. If anyone wants to go out for dinner afterward, we can certainly consider that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you need supplies and Michaels doesn't have what you want, there's an AC Moore right up the road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So mark your calendars. And RSVP quickly, even if you can't be there for the whole day or you have to change your response later -- it will help immensely to have an approximate headcount.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I'm on vacation in the Berkshires this week, and I made a bunch of cards, which I look forward to swapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a big THANK YOU to Karen, who made this happen for all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200328406000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186195420000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England ATC Meetup Group Fall Hands-On Extravanganza</name><id>6123070</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189864800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/6123070/</event_url></item>
