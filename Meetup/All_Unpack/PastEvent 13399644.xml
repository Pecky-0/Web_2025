Scheduling my very first ride.. Please come and join me for this wonderful ride in the seacoast of NH.  A panel of experts selected by Forbes.com has picked Portsmouth as one of America's prettiest towns. One judge said Portsmouth is &amp;quot;both a functioning modern community and a museum piece. Brick buildings, many of them original to the era of the tall ships, line small streets and alleys. Yet many of those same buildings house high-tech businesses and start-ups.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlights&lt;br /&gt;Though boasting only 18 miles of ocean views, the Seacoast Region offers some of the most scenic and sought after cycling in all of New Hampshire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will cycle through Historic Strawberry Bank, across New Castle Island past the gorgeous &amp;quot;Wentworth by the Sea Resort&amp;quot; and down 1A to North Hampton, stopping for a break at Jenness Beach in Rye, NH..  On the way back we will ride past some of Rye's prettiest homes and farms.. The total mileage of this ride is about 26.5 miles.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The average speed of this ride is 12-15 miles per hour.  The terrain is mostly flat with rolling hills.  If it's Windy it can be difficult to push against the wind.  Road bikes and hybrids are highly recommended, I do not recommend the use of mountain bikes on this route.  Helmets are required.  Please be sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact Cyndi if you can be a co-leader on this ride, I would love to have someone go out with the faster riders.  My email is cpariseau81@hotmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since I'm sure we will all work up an appetite, after were through lets go to BG's boathouse for a bite to eat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The meeting time for this ride is 10am leave promptly at 10:30 am...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We shall meet outside the main entrance of the Hanover St parking garage, there is a restroom inside and it costs 75 cents an hour to park in the garage.. If there is street parking available, it is free on Sundays in Portsmouth.  If the ride is cancelled, I will post it on the meetup website by 8:45 am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Portsmouth, NH (From downtown Boston drive time is about 1 hour)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.
