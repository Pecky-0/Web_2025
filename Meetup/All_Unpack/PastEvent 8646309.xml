<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will finish discussing the Prolegomena at our next meeting. The remaining text is not that long, there is some opportunity left to read ahead from the Critic of Pure Reason (this will be the next text) or read about what others said of Kant. We may choose to skip some parts of the Critic (any suggestions which?) but it looks like that a significant chunk from the beginning is voted in (probably at least up to Division II of Transcendental Logic) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bombay Club is very nice to us, they pool together tables in a quieter part of the restaurant... In exchange we begun to call them the day before to let them know how many of us they can expect. Please make sure that you INDICATE/UPDATE YOUR RSVP BY WEDNESDAY MORNING as accurately as possible! Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222989267000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220014320000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kant: Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics II</name><id>8646309</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221174000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/8646309/</event_url></item>
