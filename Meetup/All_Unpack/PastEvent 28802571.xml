Join me at Edgewater kayak in Hooksett on the Merrimack river this saturday. We will paddle from there up river to Memorial Field to have lunch, swim and rest. I will take anyone who wants to continue up river with me. Those that want to go back can simply follow the shore back the way we came. ( must have another with you ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The rentals are only$5/ hr. There are boats from 10' to 14' and tandems for 2. When you arrive, Please stop and see April to give your name and pay. We estimate 3 hours round trip so she will need $15. If you go back early or stay out longer that will be adjusted on your return but please give her your name and initial payment. If you need a paddle lesson, grap a paddle and come see me. Go choose a boat and put something in it to claim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to call ahead, I will call in a general head count. Please let me know if you will be bringing your own kayak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bring your adventurist attitude, bathing suit, lunch, water, sunscreen and water toys squirt guns if you wish. Lets enjoy some time on the water !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me if you need more info 603-315-0275&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there !&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will meet at the  launch</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cindy 107</member_name><member_id>5375585</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1313250341000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312883103000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayaking at Edgewater</name><id>28802571</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313245800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/28802571/</event_url></item>
