&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 8/2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ive uploaded a file for this event. If interested, it's an invitation to Sigrid Olsen -Isla Beach House Party on Rocky Neck Avenue - this file also includes a coupon if there's something you may wish to buy. To access it- go to top of meetup page, click on MORE, then FILES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From June to September, celebrate Nights on the Neck on the first Thursday of the month from 5:30 to 9pm. Many galleries host receptions with refreshments. Musicians, dancers, authors, historians and other entertainers give performances and lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done this several times, and it's always been a great night out. We can walk the neck, visit the open galleries, listen to music, and end up at one of the restaurants for drinks &amp;amp; / food. This is a combined event with other meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*WE WILL MEETUP @ 5pm at The Rocky Neck Art Colony sign- the sign is at the public lot at the base of Rocky Neck Avenue.  There are brochures with maps and schedule of events there. If you are unable to join us at 5, join us when you can. My contact # is: 978.289.7679. This is a mostly outdoor event - therefore, weather dependant. Please make sure to check for an update if weather is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

**You can find the schedule for August 2nd at: www.rockyneckartcolony.org &lt;br /&gt;
