Slumbrew is launching their new Imperial Red Ale, the Lobsta Killah this Wednesday at 6:00pm at the Dubliner Pub, and we'll be there!New beer, new bar: two birds, one stone. They'll have a Lobster Mac &amp;amp; Cheese special, and I'm sure there will be some Slumbrew Gear floating around! Caitlin Jewell - founder of Slumbrew - will be there as well, telling the story of the new beer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bring some friends of your own, or don't hesitate to come by yourself!&lt;/span&gt; This will be a great event for relaxing and meeting some new people over a few beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to save some space for our meetup group, but if you can't find us just text me at 909-276-7424 and I'll help!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Text me at 909-276-7424 and I will help you find the group!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich DiTieri</member_name><member_id>12427807</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366872756000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>beer buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CraftBeerCrew</urlname><id>1469154</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Craft Beer Crew</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366657268000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Slumbrew Lobsta Killah Imperial Red Launch Party at the new Dubliner Pub</name><id>115622992</id><headcount>10</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366840800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CraftBeerCrew/events/115622992/</event_url></item>
