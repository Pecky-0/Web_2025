As in most of Massachusetts, this woodland consists of second- and third-growth trees, the original virgin forests having been felled to clear land for agriculture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peters Reservation, named for the family who, in 1917, purchased the property as a family retreat, is dominated by an oak and hickory forest. The trails and understory plantings here were laid out by leading landscape architect Fletcher Steele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plantation of red pines lines much of the Reservation's frontage on the Charles River. More than two miles of trails traverse woodlands featuring a large, massed planting of Dexter hybrid rhododendrons. A short trail extension on the other side of Farm Road links Peters Reservation to Chase Woodlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Trustee's parking lot has only four spaces, WE WILL BE MEETING AT MASS AUDUBON'S BROADMOOR WILDLIFE SANCTUARY and carpool from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Broadmoor (280 Eliot Street/Route 16, Natick): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Boston: Take the Mass.
