What a day this is going to be, there are actually tears in my eyes as I write that skiing will be opening for the season tomorrow and we will be GOING THERE ON SUNDAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most of you know, the ice storm this time last year caused so many trees to fall that the wonderful people who own Windblown were devastated, and prepared to close for good as the task of clearing all the trees was so daunting.  But with their perseverance and willpower they are open again for another full year of skiing.  If you have never been to Windblown it is the quintessential rustic cross country skiing experience.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have 9 new inches on a 3 inch base, will groom 20K and allow skiing on the ungroomed trails.  I'll stay on top of the conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Windblown is $16 for a trail pass and is cash or check only, NO CREDIT CARDS!!  They also rent gear for $17.  Bring your picnic lunch, they will not have food this weekend, only hot chocolate.  We'll split up into groups based on ability, usually we ski for about 90 minutes, then eat lunch, then ski again for 90 minutes.  Leave 90 minutes for your drive there from Boston, I've done it in 75 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post to the group if you need a ride!  I will be in front of the lodge by the ski racks. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the Santa hat....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260889700000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260459713000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WINDBLOWN IS BACK, BABY!!!!  </name><id>12058868</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260716400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/12058868/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
