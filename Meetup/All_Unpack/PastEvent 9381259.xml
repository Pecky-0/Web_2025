(last year was $10-open bar)..lots of fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;X-country/downhill ski weekend in Jackson, NH...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again we have been invited by our member Ralph to spend one, two or three nights (Fri-Sun) at the Skimos Lodge in Jackson, NH. This event is limited to the first members who respond and send a check reserving your space. If all slots are already full email me directly and I will start a wait list. More spaces may open up depending on how many Skimo members go up that weekend. We would not know until the week before if we can bring more folks. Skimos is a members only lodge with separate shared rooms for men and women, bunk beds (new mattresses). Cost is $25 per night.&lt;br /&gt;You: BYO drinks, bedding and towels. The house has a huge kitchen, living room, fireplace, large dining room, etc. Check out the web site and click on the photo of the house for more photos. &lt;a href="http://www.skimos.com.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skimos.com...&lt;/a&gt;. Last year we had great fun and relaxing, chatting by the fireplace at night was really nice. There are some pictures posted on the meetup site. BTW...many of us were beginners last year and took a lesson. It is also in walking distance to the Jackson Ski area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition there is a chef that provides Saturday night and Sunday night dinner for $14 per meal to anyone who signs up in advance. He also prepares a full breakfast every morning for $6 per breakfast. The food was excellent and worth the cost but you are also welcome to bring your own food or eat out. The menu choices will be available the week before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocktail party with live band hosted at Skimos on Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine Tasting - South American: We'll feature value wines from Chile and Argentina. Fantastic reds like Malbec and Carmenere and fruitful whites.&lt;br /&gt;Cost $15. &lt;br /&gt;Starts 4:45pm PROMPT  Saturday 17th January . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet you around the fireplace...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234045986000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
