We are accepting donations for the next few weeks.  You can drop items off when you come to a meetup or let me know what would be a good time for you.  As you know I run the gym on donations from climbers/guests. Funds from this annual yard sale helps keep the gym running!  &lt;br /&gt;The yard sale will run Fri June 4th 1-6pm and Sat. June 5th 9-3pm the gym will be open these hours as as wel.  So if you want to also help, come by the open gym, and check out the sale!  Cassidy wants to get involved and she's going to sell snacks and drinks!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275792869000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272934685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Gym/Benefit Yard Sale</name><id>13375045</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275670800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/13375045/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/6/global_13152102.jpeg</photo_url></item>
