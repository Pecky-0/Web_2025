<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our featured speakers at the July 13 meeting will be Dave Cormier and Karyl Lynch of Pelham West Associates.  Dave and Karyl, as product scouts, are paid by client companies rather than by inventors. The types of products they are currently seeking may be found at their website, www.pelhamwest.com.  They will describe their experiences as product scouts and new product evaluators and as partners in a small manufacturing company that has brought several products licensed from independent inventors to market. Founded 11 years ago, Pelham West matches new products with client companies.  Dave and Karyl will also provide insight on how companies review products and how new product licensing has changed in the last 10  years.  Pelham West's clients range from mom-and-pops to  Fortune 100 companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave and Karyl are founders of the Innovators Resource Network, the only other inventors' group like IANE in Massachusetts.  The IRN regularly meets in Springfield.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Hausslein</member_name><member_id>6657308</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252971369000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Inventors and Service Providers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Inventors-Association-of-New-England</urlname><id>1367613</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Inventors Association of New England</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244506167000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Inventors Association of New England July Meetup</name><id>10607763</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247526000000</time><rsvp_limit>70</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Inventors-Association-of-New-England/events/10607763/</event_url></item>
