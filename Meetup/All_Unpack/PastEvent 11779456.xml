They released their Dancethink LP in 2007 and have been touring pretty consistently since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the band’s members are graduates of the School of Music at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (my alma mater), and the singer happens to be my roommate’s cousin. These bizarre coincidences mean that I have seen them every time they’ve come to Boston, and they put on a great show that is not to be missed. Get ready to dance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Harper’s Ferry page:&lt;br /&gt;Known for its distinctive &amp;quot;DanceThink Music,&amp;quot; the band’s debut has been met with critical acclaim since its 2007 release. With music featuring electrified bagpipes, and a line-up including a two-time International Acoustic Music Award winning composer, a three-time world champion instrumentalist, a 1st place Michigan Idol-winning singer, and two 1st place M-Block Records “New Music on the Block”-winning recording artists, My Dear Disco's live show has been hailed as &amp;quot;...one of the must see-acts in Detroit and Ann Arbor.&amp;quot; —The Detroit Fashion Pages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fymp6zKJtM"&gt;My Dear Disco Tribute Video&lt;/a&gt; (made by my roommate)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ritesh</member_name><member_id>4789957</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelley</member_name><member_id>9585647</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258506735000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257224373000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>My Dear Disco – 11/15 @ Harper’s Ferry in Allston</name><id>11779456</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258333200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11779456/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/f/global_8845759.jpeg</photo_url></item>
