&lt;p&gt;Kitchen Cravings 15 Airport Road, Gilford, NH 03249 &lt;a href="http://kitchencravingsnh.com" class="linkified"&gt;http://kitchencravingsnh.com&lt;/a&gt; 603-528-0001   Kitchen Cravings is on Airport Road adjacent to Laconia Airport. The ambiance is wonderful... a cozy place, full of regulars from the local community.  Breakfast, lunch and dinners, and they are now serving wines and microbrews.  Their menu is extensive with biscuits and gravy, souffle style omelets, benedicts, burgers, and more.  The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive to requests.  Their menu states &amp;ldquo;If you do not see what your taste buds want, please ask. We appreciate your cravings and will do all we can to satisfy them.&amp;rdquo;  Great fresh food, friendly people, homey atmosphere.   Let's go!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1302708232000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Food and flying always works.
