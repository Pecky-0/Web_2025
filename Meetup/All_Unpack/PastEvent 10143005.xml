You'll be developing yourself at the same time in these areas. Learn how to read body cues, listen for what is attractive and how to encourage people to be attractive to you also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is attraction? That will be explored in depth. Is it something missing in you? Something that you want to develop in yourself? Something that reminds you of someone else? Something that you are &amp;quot;completing&amp;quot; in someone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sliding scale of $20-40. 7:00-9:30pm. Traditional cost of Herb's workshops have been 40 and trying to make it accessible to everyone. If you can pay more than 20 it helps those who might not be able to afford 20. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce is a relationship coach of 30 years for couples, singles and families.
