<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a members-only meeting which means you must have paid the  full dues of $40.00 and signed the statement of ethics prior to the  meeting to be able to attend. No visitors are allowed at this meeting  because of confidentiality rules. Being a member of the meetup is not  the same as being a member of the Innovators Resource Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting agenda will be e-mailed separately when decided upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  it is always a good idea to rsvp "Yes" to meetup events. That way  organizers can contact only the people who rsvp'ed with any updates or  changes to the event, instead of emailing the whole list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEATHER: if STCC is closed, IRN is not meeting that day. Visit STCC's website if there's bad weather that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
IRN members - do you want to present to the closed meeting ? - This is a closed meeting and your opportunity to get a focus  group and/or advice or else inform us of your progress. Please email or  contact us if you wish to take advantage of this - (message Michael or  Karen here or email infoATirnetworkDOTorg )</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Simmons</member_name><member_id>8836144</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Kat.</member_name><member_id>8999115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Blanchard</member_name><member_id>9728219</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299196225000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297910285000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March members-only meeting</name><id>16595772</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299108600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/16595772/</event_url></item>
