With the financial crisis always in the headlines, “superstorms” related to global warming occurring more frequently, perpetual unemployment, and political gridlock that refuses to address our concerns, we are all looking for solutions to the problems of our world. The Zeitgeist Movement's principle focus includes the recognition that the majority of the social and economic problems that plague the human species at this time are not the sole result of some institutional corruption, scarcity, a political policy, a flaw of "human nature" or other commonly held assumptions of causality. Rather, The Movement recognizes that issues such as poverty, corruption, collapse, homelessness, war, starvation and the like appear to be "symptoms" born out of an outdated social structure. By recognizing the root cause of our world’s problems as the very monetary system, the defining goal of The Movement is the building of a new socioeconomic model, a resource based economy, based upon technically responsible resource management, allocation and distribution through what would be considered the scientific method of reasoning out problems and finding optimized solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363479394000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363364408000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Zeitgeist Day 2013 Boston</name><id>109415702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363467600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/109415702/</event_url></item>
