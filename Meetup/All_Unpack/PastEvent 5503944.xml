Terry has been photographing wild places for over 35 years, and he will bring many examples of his work to show and discuss with participants. Come listen and learn from a master photographer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry's photographs have been shown in galleries from Rockport and New York City to Denver. His haunting image of the gazebo in Masconomo Park in Manchester-by-the-Sea appeared in Polaroid Land Photography (1978) by Ansel Adams. Several of his photographs are part of the permanent Polaroid Collection, as well as in other private and corporate collections nationally and internationally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a preview of Terry's work, see his website at www.terrywalkerphotography.com. Don't miss this opportunity to see his extraordinary photographs and chat with him about his methods in a small intimate setting. Refreshments will be served. This group will be limited to 10 people, so sign up now!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173812945000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172154636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Terry Walker Presentation</name><id>5503944</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173639600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/5503944/</event_url></item>
