All this for only $25, of which 100% will go to Ron Paul's campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are expecting to fill the place which holds 300 people and tickets are for sale now. We are notifying the media and finalizing all the last minute details. I will update as we have more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great opportunity to &amp;quot;rally the troops&amp;quot; in a fun, and entertaining environment that is sure to attract alot of publicity and motivate others to join the campaign. We will also have an opportunity to raise some needed cash that will go directly to national headquarters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to come soon...&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542251000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190900804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fundraiser in Worcester, MA</name><id>6437809</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191711600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6437809/</event_url></item>
