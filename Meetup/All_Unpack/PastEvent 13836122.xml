Fires are lit all along the city's riverways. Also featured are performers, such as musicians and mimes. The lighting is at 8:30 p.m. For more details go to waterfire.org&lt;br /&gt;My thinking is this: Let's meet at the Providence Place Mall. Go 146 south into Rhode Island until it merges with 95 South. Take exit 22B off 95 South and follow signs to mall. I don't want to arrange a dinner at a restaurant in the Providence area, because I know from past experience how mobbed the restaurants are down there. So, I think we should just eat on our own before leaving, or grab a bite at one of the many vendors selling food at waterfire. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorena Nozzolillo</member_name><member_id>4168426</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277678025000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276823507000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire in Providence</name><id>13836122</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277591400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/13836122/</event_url></item>
