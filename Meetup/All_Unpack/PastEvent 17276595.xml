Filmmaker Michael P. Nash's stark documentary outlines a frightening vision of a future in which depleted resources and shrinking coastlines force millions of people to become "climate refugees." But where will they go? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All donations will be given to support the work of the American Refugee Committee &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303656183000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302621056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup for April - Climate Refugees</name><id>17276595</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303599600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/17276595/</event_url></item>
