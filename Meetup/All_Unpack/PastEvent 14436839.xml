We were recently one of the stops on the Coop Ext Backyard Locavore Tour and some people were not able to make it, so.... come see a permaculture property *in development* and get some ideas on what might work at your place.  But, mostly, just come for an enjoyable summer evening of connecting with fellow permaculture enthusiasts and sample food from one of the notoriously best potlucks in town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:30 Potluck&lt;br /&gt;7:00 Garden Tour (self-guided or with Lisa and Dave)&lt;br /&gt;Social time until about 8:30&lt;br /&gt;Optional firepit if enough interest....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your potluck kit (bowl/plate/utensils/cup/napkin) and a dish or beverage to share!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1282855616000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281966967000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August Meetup &amp; Potluck</name><id>14436839</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282689000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/14436839/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/2/global_8948002.jpeg</photo_url></item>
