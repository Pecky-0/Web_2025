Hear about their history, special mechanical issues you might not know about, and of course stories from the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting,  we hope to even have a tandem to try, so please bring a partner! I'll bring the chocolates! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COUPLES WITH CHILDREN: To encourage couples to attend even if they have children, we WILL BE PROVIDING CHILD CARE for this meeting. If you would like to bring your children, please include them in your RSVP count, and contact me privately with their ages. If you are able to contribute towards the babysitting cost, that would be appreciated but not required. Please bring your childrens' favorite toys, books, and games along to contribute to keeping them engaged. We will have the featured presentation first, and try to wrap it up by about 8, so if you need to leave early due to bedtime, feel free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tandem discussion, we also have some business items to discuss, notably bike valet parking at the BCM Bike Swap in April, other bike valet opportunities, and other types of charitable initiatives we would like to undertake.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172802062000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169570008000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tandems: Bicycling with Love</name><id>5417931</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172102400000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/5417931/</event_url></item>
