<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Everyone! Now that its turning colder its bowling season again! We had an event at Kings last spring and it was a good time. Corinne and I will get there early and reserve a few lanes right next to each other so we're one big group. Just ask at the desk for the lanes reserved for Meetup or Keuning (our last name). If you have trouble finding us, feel free to give us a call on our cell phones: Corinne - (617) 780-1329, Brad - (617) 780-1627. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're limiting the size of the group to 30 people (15 couples). If you RSVP, please make sure to update it if you can't make it. Any &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; RSVP's will be changed to &amp;quot;no's&amp;quot; 3 days before the event to free up space for other couples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corinne &amp;amp; Brad&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to the bowling desk and ask for the lanes under Keuning or Meetup.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247452809000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224938042000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bowling at Kings</name><id>9028607</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227398400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/9028607/</event_url></item>
