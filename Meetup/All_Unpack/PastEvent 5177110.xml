Pete teaches the BCM's Cycling Safety Instructor's training, and recently completed the nationally-certified Bicycling Road I course from the &lt;a href="http://www.bikeleague.org/" target="_blank"&gt;League of American Bicyclists&lt;/a&gt;. We are pleased to have him come and talk with us about safety concerns we may have during the course of our daily riding. We will also have plenty of printed material on the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn't do much over the summer, but I hope to get us going again this fall. PLEASE RSVP to this invitation so we will know that it will be worth Pete's time to come here from Augusta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1161385487000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160069240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discussion: Safe Biking in Traffic</name><id>5177110</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1161212400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/5177110/</event_url></item>
