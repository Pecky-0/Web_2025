 &lt;br /&gt;

Matthew will talk about the medical evidence for exercise, diet, and meditation being able to modify the aging process. He will also speak about the impact meditation has not only on longevity but also on individual consciousness. He'll finish with meditation and time for questions.  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Matthew is a contributing author to the book &lt;em&gt;Meditation as Medication for the Soul&lt;/em&gt; by Rajinder Singh. His chapter “Meditation: 25 Years Experience in Primary Care Medicine” chronicals meditation as it has gone from being considered a fringe practice to its currently being called the secret to optimum health." He is a clinical physician and coordinating director of the geriatric teaching program in family medicine at Middlesex Hospital in Connecticut and lectures extensively about the healing power of meditation throughout the United States and Canada. &lt;br /&gt;
