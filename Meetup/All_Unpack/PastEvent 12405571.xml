This is the location we used to go to, not the new one.   Please read all the details of this event below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have to pay $10 per family (regardless of number of people or dogs) in ADVANCE. We have to make sure we'll have enough people to make it worth the owner's while to open for us. If by Friday evening, I do not have 5 people signed up and paid, the event will be cancelled. (And in which case, your money will be refunded.) You can pay me with PayPal (if you pay with PayPal, the cost is $10.61 because of their fee, and if we cancel, you will receive $10.00 back) or mail me a check, but payment must be received NLT Friday, 1/29. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact if you have any questions at all about the details of this Meetup.  I know this is short notice, so I hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-laura&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265040731000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264312517000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel January Meetup</name><id>12405571</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264867200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/12405571/</event_url></item>
