Brilliantly capturing the terrifying drama of catastrophe, Egan does equal justice to the human characters who become his heroes, “the stoic, long-suffering men and women whose lives he opens up with urgency and respect” (New York Times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be on a bench in the lower level.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elizabeth Ivey</member_name><member_id>9394837</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329675406000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1481208</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286022442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worst Hard Time by Timothy Egan</name><id>14972614</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287613800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group/events/14972614/</event_url></item>
