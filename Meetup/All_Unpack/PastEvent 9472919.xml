We will need salads, rolls/bread, butter, desserts, drinks, and maybe another main dish. I will let you know the address later. I hope to do some carpooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy N. is going to be talking about cruises. Bring photos from cruises you have been on if you'd like. Come and have some good food and fun at least talking about travel.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy </member_name><member_id>3699089</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240674459000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231379771000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Italian Potluck Supper</name><id>9472919</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233442800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/9472919/</event_url></item>
