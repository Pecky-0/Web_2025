<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The very Irish Jimmy O'Shea will be leading our normal 7PM Illuminated Frisbee on Russell Field (next to Alewife Station).  We'll be playing from 7PM to 9:30ish.  Please bring your Green St. Paddy's Day Speedos for some Slip 'n Sliding fun as Mr. Weather.com says it's going to rain.  A change of clothes, gloves and a trash bag are recommended for going out afterwards for some good old fashion green beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before attending our events, please review our &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about/"&gt;About us&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, frisbee batteries, lighted lanyards, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/IRMLHWE8OGKZ"&gt;Amazon Wishlist&lt;/a&gt; to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your non-obligatory donations are certainly appreciated! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=russell+field&amp;amp;near=Cambridge,+MA&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;cid=42393842,-71137932,3047228862203817381&amp;amp;li=lmd&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;t=m"&gt;Russell Field Map&lt;/a&gt;.  Should you decide to take the red line to Alewife, look for signs upon exiting that will direct you to Russell Field (back entrance). Free parking is also available at the Summer Shack, located on the Alewife Parkway across from the entrance to Rindge Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about our group, don't hesitate to contact our Organizers! See you on the field!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Other Jim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Speedos are highly encouraged, but not required.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Chea</member_name><member_id>4415505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205708594000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><why>Because soon enough, it'll be too warm to play frisbee in the freezing rain at night wearing Speedos.</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205260159000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Slip 'n Slide Speedo Frisbee Fun Time - Russell Field</name><id>7511528</id><headcount>28</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205535600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7511528/</event_url></item>
