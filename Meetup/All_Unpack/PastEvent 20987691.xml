&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #94008c"&gt;Get Out of the Rat Race&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;"In 1994, after becoming financially free, I was searching for a way to teach others what my rich dad had taught me. You can only learn so much by reading and it dawned on me that rich dad taught me through repetition. That is why I began creating educational board games. They are, in my opinion, the easiest and best way to increase your financial intelligence while you&amp;rsquo;re having fun. The rich teach their children how to convert earned income into either passive or portfolio income. If you were raised middle-class or poor, chances are that you were not taught this single most important fundamental to becoming rich&amp;mdash;financially free for life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;This is one thing CASHFLOW the game trains players how to do. By playing the game over and over, you begin to break up the core conditioning most people learn at home and at school&amp;mdash;the conditioning of working hard for money." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&amp;mdash;Robert Kiyosaki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307913247000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Entrepreneurs</urlname><id>1322739</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester, NH Entrepreneurs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307227431000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>play CASHFLOW!
