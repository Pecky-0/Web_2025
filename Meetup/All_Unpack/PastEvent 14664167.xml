Presentations start at 7.  For directions and parking info, check out the &lt;a href="http://loft.bocoup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bocoup Loft's page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feature presentations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction to Reason.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; To borrow a phrase from a late 90s blockbuster, &amp;quot;No one can be told what Reason is. You have to see it for yourself&amp;quot;. Propellerheads Reason is an entirely self-contained music creation studio that looks and feels different from any conventional DAW. Chris L, an independent Reason user (translation: no sales pitch), will give us an overview and breeze through the song creation process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foundations of Synthesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Beyond the Presets -or- Oh THAT'S what that knob does. Travis B will cover some popular synthesis techniques, such as subtractive synthesis and FM synthesis. The goal of the talk is to explain the basics of synthesis itself and leave you with a broad set of knowledge you can apply to ANY synthesizing instrument (hard or soft) you might have. The demonstration will be with Reason (free demo) though we will actively avoid anything Reason-specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so we know how much pizza to get! If you have a song of your creation you'd like to share and discuss with other attendees, please say so in the corresponding question on the RSVP form. Don't forget to invite your friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yev</member_name><member_id>3234171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289435364000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Music Makers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>musical</urlname><id>413373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Music Makers With Relaxed Expectations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283702735000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reason Synthesis Pizza Magic</name><id>14664167</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285799400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/musical/events/14664167/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/f/global_17725199.jpeg</photo_url></item>
