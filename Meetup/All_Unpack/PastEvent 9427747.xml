You got a Sunday movie! Albeit kind of a last-minute Sunday movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's all be kids again and go see &lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809420569/info" target="_blank"&gt;The Tale of Despereaux&lt;/a&gt;. Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Tiny and graced with oversized ears, Despereaux was born too big for his little world. Refusing to live his life cowering, he befriends a Princess named Pea and learns to read (rather than eat) books -- reveling in stories of knights, dragons and fair maidens. Banished from Mouseworld for being more man than mouse, Despereaux is rescued by another outcast, Roscuro, who also wants to hear the tales. But when the Princess dismisses Roscuro's friendship, he becomes the ultimate rat and plots revenge with fellow outsider Mig. After Pea is kidnapped, Despereaux discovers he is the only one who can rescue her...and that even the tiniest mouse can find the courage of a knight in shining armor.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 5:25, so let's meet right inside the lobby doors BY 5:00. Please call me if you're going to be late, if you've changed your RSVP after 3 p.m. that day, or if you're lost! We will be heading in by 5:10 at the latest. Last Tuesday's movie was wicked crowded because of school vacation, so I'm assuming this movie will be, too. To ensure that we all get seats together, we have to head in by 5:10. If you're going to be late, I have a workaround, but I need to know to wait for you. So please keep in touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted tickets for FMM members and their guests is $8.50. Small popcorn and small soda vouchers are available for $3.00 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on Sunday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231622199000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230927458000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tale of Despereaux</name><id>9427747</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231106400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/9427747/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
