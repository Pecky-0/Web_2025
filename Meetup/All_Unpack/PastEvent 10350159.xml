The electrical field generated by the heart is 60 times that of the brain.  &lt;b&gt;The magnetic field generated by the heart is 5000 times that of the brain. If we learn to connect with the power of our hearts, and bring this power into our daily lives, we empower our visions and actions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart thrives on coherence.  In fact, both our emotional and physical health are better when our lives are coherent.  Coherence is a sense that life is purposeful, manageable and meaningful. Our heart wants our lives to be purposeful, manageable and meaningful.  So rather than just thinking, listening and following our heart allows for more ease and joy, &lt;i&gt;therefore attracting into our lives more of what we want.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when times are tough (e.g. our current economic climate, challenges in relationships, juggling multiple responsibilities in daily life), coming from a heart space will help you move through the challenges with creativity and power.  No matter what happens externally, coming from heart space will help you stay empowered.  And living in coherence strengthens your creative force, so your actions are strengthened with full heart power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linda Marks, BostonLOA member and heart-centered therapist and coach&lt;/b&gt;, provides experiential exercises to help you remain emotionally, physically and energetically grounded and empowered through your heart space, no matter what happens externally.  These exercises will help you resolve the following questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)When you are in a vibrationally contracted space of fear, pain or hurt, how do you get grounded and centered and tap back into the power of your heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)When a friend or loved one is in a space of fear, pain or hurt, and you are centered and strong, how do you help your friend or loved one regain their center without losing yours or being drained?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Linda Marks:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.healingheartpower.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda Marks, MSM, is a body-centered psychotherapist, coach, social architect and author.
