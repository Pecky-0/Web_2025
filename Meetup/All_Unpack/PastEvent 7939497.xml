The facilities here include a fully stocked bar and restaurant so come down with your friends, family and pets for a few drinks, some food and a fun day out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there its easiest in a car. Its about 25 mins down 93 south then 138, let me know if you would like to attend but need a ride and i will do my best to set something up. Also let me know if you will be driving and have room for others too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively catch the train from south station to canton junction and its a short cab ride from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post match function with a rocking live band later on in the night will be held at Tommy Doyles HARVARD SQUARE at 8pm with shenanigans sure to continue well into the night.  Come join!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Damo</member_name><member_id>4884584</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213030439000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210800683000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Demons V Baltimore/Washington Eagles Footy Match and Post Match Party</name><id>7939497</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212857100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/7939497/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/7/global_4125959.jpeg</photo_url></item>
