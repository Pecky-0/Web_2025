&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groups of up to 12 volunteers are invited to serve at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program by leading recreational activities for our adult respite patients. Leading patient activities is one of our most popular service projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Before your scheduled visit, we will help your group design an activity such as a rousing game of bingo, a creative arts and crafts project, a themed event and more. Upon arrival at BHCHP, we will provide an overview of our work, the patients we serve, and the depth of our services. We will support your team throughout the project and provide an opportunity to reflect on your experience before departure.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Hours: Saturdays from 12-4 PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
