We've been busy having a great summer and enjoying the gorgeous weather! We've been swimming, digging in the sand, having BBQ picnics, playing Summer Camp games &amp;amp; winning prizes.  We hope you've had a good time too.  Now it's time to start thinking about all the fun we have with our friends when we go Back to School.  Come join us tomorrow from 11:00am-1:00pm for a Back to School Orientation!  You will have a chance to meet new friends and counselors and maybe even learn a thing or two! Can't wait to see you all there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &amp;amp; puppy kisses, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auntie Becky &amp;amp; Auntie Kayla &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Tyngsboro</member_name><member_id>3988390</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284395315000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-78</urlname><id>467180</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282429082000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back to School </name><id>14496908</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282489200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-78/events/14496908/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/1/e/global_4283150.jpeg</photo_url></item>
