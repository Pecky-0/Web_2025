We'll picninc for 1/2 hr. and then have an Apple Hill hike (southern part of the area) for about 1 1/2 hours. It's a good hike for beginers. Lots of up hill, but not hard. A small wooden tower is at the top of the hill with a view of Bantam Lake and the hills of the area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn't much parking at the trail head so we should carpool as much as possible. There's no parking lot there so it's all on the side of the street. Meet at the Conservation Center on Rt. 202 at the dirt/gravel parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80 Whitehall Road&lt;br /&gt;Litchfield, Connecticut 06759&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrive at Concervation Center at 1:30 PM. We'll find a spot to picnic for a late lunch. Kevin (leader) will bring subs for our members, just indicate in your RSVP if you'd like turkey, ham, or veggie subs. Kevin will also bring soda and cups. Please bring something to share with the group for the picnic and indicate on your RSVP what that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll wind up the picnic by about 2:15 PM. Then we'll transfer to trailhead carpool and leave.  (YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ON THE HIKE! YOU COULD JUST DO THE PICNIC.) Arrive at Trailhead at 2:30 PM. Hike for 1.5 hours and done at 4 PM. Carpool back to other vehicles by 4:15 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.
