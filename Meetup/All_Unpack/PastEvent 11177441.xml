<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm hosting a Tastefully Simple party at my house.  It is a party where the we get to pass around different breads, dips, and other foods to sample.  The Tastefully Simple Consultant will share her expertise with us.  There is more information to come, but I figured I'll get it out there for you all to check out while I'm awaiting the additional info.  Best of all, if we are not quite full by the end of the demonstration, we can go out to eat at one of a variety of restaurants in our neighborhood.  I have tried some of Tastefully Simple's dips and bread before and LOVED them, so I figured why not share it with you all. :0)  As with all consultant type home parties, she will be asking for a sale at the end of the party, but please do not feel pressured to buy anything.  We just want you to come to our home, get to know each other, and enjoy some yummies.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tammy </member_name><member_id>7303013</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254081986000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251035465000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tastefully Simple</name><id>11177441</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253386800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/11177441/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
