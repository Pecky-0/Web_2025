I'd love to host a night paddle on Thursday, July 9 beginning around 6:00 p.m. I'm in a great location, plenty of parking, great put in and a grill to BBQ after the paddle. If you've never paddled Bow Lake before and want to join me in July, let me know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Route 4 W:  &lt;br /&gt;From Spaulding Turnpike, take exit 6W onto Rte. 4W toward Durham/Concord, Stay on Rte. 4 to Lee Traffic Circle, continue on Rte 4 for 14.1 miles, turn right onto BOW LAKE ROAD, go .7 miles, Bow Lake Road curves to the left at a big rock, Simpson Lane is approximately 1.4 miles on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Route 4 E:&lt;br /&gt;From Epsom Traffic Circle, travel 8.1 miles, turn left onto BOW LAKE ROAD, go .7 miles, Bow Lake Road curves to the left at a big rock, Simpson Lane is approximately 1.4 miles on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on Simpson Lane, follow the middle driveway towards a blue camp.

Bring food if you want to eat after the paddle.  We should be able to paddle for 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorinda Ouellette&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Harter</member_name><member_id>7618241</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorinda</member_name><member_id>7920404</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247497069000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245673330000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bow Lake, Northwood, NH</name><id>10706013</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247176800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/10706013/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/a/global_8720682.jpeg</photo_url></item>
