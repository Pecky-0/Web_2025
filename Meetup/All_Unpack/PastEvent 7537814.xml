<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The day is so nice and sunny after the rains I can't help but hike! Sorry about the late notice but weather and work finally cleared. This is an out-and-back style hike (may loop depending on conditions and temperament) where we'll aim to hike 3 hours max. with turnaround at about 1.5 hrs. out. There is plenty of trail so we'll see how far we can go and explore. I figure 4 - 5 miles of hiking. I'll check signups once at about 12:30 PM today. It might be best to give me a call on my cell if you plan to attend and if you RSVP after 1 PM today, the day of the hike. My cell is in my RSVP. We'll hike mostly on the white blaze trail that runs the spine of the giant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike would start from the trailhead off of the paved parking lot across from Quinnipiac University. The hike would be moderately difficult with a fair amount of up/down on the trail and a respectable length of a hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot at 2 PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be about 46 F with 12 MPH winds for the hike so wear light layers for warmth (avoid cotton material). Might be good to have a daypack to stow layers shed as you warm up. water, snack. Wear boots as it WILL be muddy after the rains! Bring a quart of water and some trail food/lunch for energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions via MapQuest for parking lot off Mt.
