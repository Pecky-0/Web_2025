<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><state>MA</state><who>Dog Lovers</who><category><shortname>pets-animals</shortname><id>26</id><name>pets/animals</name></category><description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of bringing dogs to a fenced in "boxing ring" to rough house and potentially get hurt, we are bringing them on a focused walk in their most natural state - in a pack.  &lt;br /&gt;We can do simple paved trails, such as Bare Cove or Pond Meadow Park. Or we can step it up a notch and try the paths less traveled, and go for hikes on the Blue Hills.  Location suggestions are welcome! &lt;br /&gt;So, all friendly pups and their owners, come join us on our walks for exercise, socialization and some fresh air.  &lt;br /&gt;Remember - A tired dog is a well behaved dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are bringing your dog(s) at your own risk. Some of our walks are in areas where the dogs can be off leash. For the safety of the pack, dogs should be under verbal control and supervised at all times, otherwise &amp;nbsp;please keep your dog(s) on a leash. A responsible owner must be present with the dogs at all times.  This is, in no way, intended to be a dog walking service. I am not a trainer, just a dog owner and lover.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.76</rating><join_mode>approval</join_mode><created>1203877134000</created><lat>42.2099990845</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>638</id><urlkey>hiking</urlkey><name>Hiking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9753</id><urlkey>offleash</urlkey><name>Off Leash Dog Recreation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9772</id><urlkey>activedogs</urlkey><name>Active Dogs</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15067</id><urlkey>dogs</urlkey><name>Dogs</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15984</id><urlkey>dog-lovers</urlkey><name>Dog Lovers</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18874</id><urlkey>dog-walks</urlkey><name>dog walks</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>19061</id><urlkey>socializing-dogs</urlkey><name>Socializing Dogs</name></topics_item></topics><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name><id>1030709</id><members>478</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>10149477</member_id><name>Chris</name></organizer><urlname>packwalk</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/2/3/600_20112067.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/2/3/highres_20112067.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>20112067</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/2/3/thumb_20112067.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Braintree</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/</link><lon>-71.0</lon></item>
