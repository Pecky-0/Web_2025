This film is a Hartford premiere.  This is a great film that I've previously seen, but I'll see it again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(France, 2008) Written, directed and drawn by Michel Ocelot. (English language version) With the voices of: Steven Kynman, Nigel Pilkington, Suzanna Nour, Nigel Lambert, and Frederick Benedict. The fourth film by celebrated French animator Michel Ocelot is an all-ages fantasy inspired by One Thousand and One Nights. The beautiful, jewel-like animation tells the story of a wealthy young French boy (Azur) who bonds with the son (Asman) of his Arabic nursemaid. The nursemaid enchants the boys with the tale of a magical fairy called a Djinn, who has been captured and can only be rescued by a prince. Although Azur's father cruelly sends Asmar and his mother away, the boys reunite in medieval Maghreb in their quest to free the Djinn. A brilliant fable that speaks to children's love of adventure, and the director's hopes for a peaceful, multiethnic society. The music is by Lebanese-born composer Gabriel Yared and the legendary Afida Tahri. 99 min. &lt;a href="http://www.gkids.com/azur.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gkids.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I still look llike my picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239236726000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236556630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Azur and Asmar</name><id>9911290</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238350500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/9911290/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
