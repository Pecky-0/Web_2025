This will be our fifth standout at this location. We had a great success showing our Ron Paul signs and banner to thousands of commuters the first, second (even in the rain!), third and fourth time around.

An added bonus for this standout-signwave location is the opportunity to demonstrate public support for Ron Paul to the Boston Globe newspaper located right down the street on Morrissey Blvd.

Plenty of signs available for everyone! Let's make this very high traffic location a great success and a larger turnout!

At the UMass MBTA stop exit at the upper level on Columbia Road.
