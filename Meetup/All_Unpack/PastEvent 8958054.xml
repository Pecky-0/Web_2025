Kim and Kate will be the hosts for evening in Haverhill.  They ask that you bring your favorite poker/finger food or drink.  To make the evening more interesting and to provide something for the winners, there will be a $1 buy-in.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never played, have no fear, Texas Hold 'Em is very easy to learn and there is no shame in playing with a with a written out cheat sheet of hands next to you.
