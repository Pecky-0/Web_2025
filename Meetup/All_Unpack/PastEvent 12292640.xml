We will hike at a pace of our slowest hiker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have our own individual pace and many organizers offer many levels of hiking to give you options of the level and pace that is comfortable for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be hiking Mt. Moosilaukee via the Glencliff Trail  to the summit of Mt. Moosilauke. The total distance covered is eight miles and should take approximately seven hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail runs from High St. (formerly Sanatorium Rd.) to the Moosilauke Carriage Rd. in a sag just north of Moosilaukeâ€™s South Peak. It is part of the AT. There is only one steep section, and the footing is generally good. The trailhead parking area is on the right a short distance past the trail sign; from here, one may follow an old farm road past a gate. The upper part is above the treeline and greatly exposed to the elements, so it can be dangerous in bad weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during our hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being prepared, traveling with the appropriate gear &amp;amp; knowing how to use it is your personal responsibility. Test and adjust your gear prior to this trip. Snowshoes,crampons, and micro spikes a must!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!! NO COTTON CLOTHING !! - Cotton (a.k.a. the death cloth) has no place in the mountains. If you arrive wearing cotton clothing you will be turned away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266844308000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263256397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Moosilauke</name><id>12292640</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266670800000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12292640/</event_url></item>
