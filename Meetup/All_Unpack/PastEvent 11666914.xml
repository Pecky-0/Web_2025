I thought my dancing tank was depleted. Then I stumbled into the Toubab Krewe stage area and I was rejuvenated. By the end I was a swirling exhausted dancing mess- it was an amazing show and I would love to turn some new folks onto the joy that is Toubab Krewe's music.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come join me at the Middle East for a new music experience! Let's do pre show drinks- maybe loosen some of you up so perhaps some dancing magic can happen! Once we get closer to the date of the show we can discuss a preshow place of choice. Seriously, check the music out! Is it a little different from some of the regular shows posted? Yes, but new music is almost always a good thing!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;Jenn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.toubabkrewe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.toubabkrew...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets= $15&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will provide my cell phone number prior to the meetup</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenn</member_name><member_id>10142965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258938607000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256012750000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Toubab Krewe</name><id>11666914</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258765200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/11666914/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/d/global_11325021.jpeg</photo_url></item>
