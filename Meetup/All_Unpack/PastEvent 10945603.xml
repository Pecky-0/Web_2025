Arrive earlier if you plan on having breakfast. We will be leaving for 10:00. First quick stop will be about 1 hour into the ride for a pee break only. Then we will travel all the back roads, going by the coast in Dartmouth and Westport. Lunch will be at The Provender in Tiverton. If you are an ice cream lover, across the street is Gray's Ice Cream. For the best of both have a 1/2 sandwich for lunch then head to Grays for yummy ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 2 ride.&lt;br /&gt;Arrive with a full tank of gas!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248820660000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248396284000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Westport Back Roads</name><id>10945603</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248528600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/10945603/</event_url></item>
