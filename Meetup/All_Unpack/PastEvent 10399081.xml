After the long winter and with the addition of new members we are hoping to get some fresh enthusiasm for the Needham and Boston West Suburbs French Language Meetup and to get it rolling again.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People from beginner to native French speakers who are seriously interested in speaking French, improving their language skills, forming study groups, or just making new friends with people who share their same love of the French language are encouraged to come.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue is perfect for people who want a light dinner or just a cup of coffee or a cold beverage.  The menu is reasonably priced. The location is convenient, just off of Rt128/95 in Needham catty corner to Staples at Second Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to speaking French, this can also be an opportunity to exchange ideas for future Meetups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't know what your level is you can go to this website and take the proficiency test.  It's also a good site for brushing up on your language skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://french.about.com/od/proficiency/Proficiency_in_French_French_Proficiency_Standards_French_Tests.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://french.about.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will make every effort to seat you near someone who is close to your level so that you will feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there and to make some new friends.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Meetup or Francesca</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248217440000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>french-789</urlname><id>1150221</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Boston Metrowest French Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242180029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Needham and Boston West Suburbs French Language Meetup Greets The Summer</name><id>10399081</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245798000000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/french-789/events/10399081/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/0/global_4128560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
