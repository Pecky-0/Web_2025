<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;First of all let me say that if you take things seriously all the time, this (hike? event? insanity? thing?) is not for you. If you do not read the whole trip post you aren't allowed to participate. This hike is a bad idea... and brilliant at the same time (thanks to Spruce and Twizz who helped me think it up, as well everyone who participated in the first one)! If you think that eating candy, ice cream and drinking a cold beer on top of a mountain while stumbling around in fits of laughter sounds like a good time, then perhaps this hike is for you. If you care what mountains we are hiking, then this hike is not for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueberries will be in season at this time, blueberries go great in ice cream, beer, martinis and just straight in mouth (all of which we will have handy). This hike will be the Baldface mountains, which have a great view, particularly for mountains under 4k feet. You can find some info about them, including directions to the trail head here: &lt;a href="http://hikenh.netfirms.com/TDBaldfC.htm" class="linkified"&gt;http://hikenh.netfirms.com/TDBaldfC.htm&lt;/a&gt; It does take a while to get there because there are stop lights along RT 16 (alternately you can take I93 to 3 to 302 and go over everything, but that ends up taking just as long), so plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wackiness is required! Questionable mental state is welcomed (however must I ask that you be medicated)! Horses are not permitted (sorry Spruce). Costumes are encouraged (except horse costumes since horses are banned)! Inner monkeys cherished! Cotton is accepted (I know, I know, but seriously your judgment is already a little off if you are signing up). Speed.... mostly irrelevant... however it should be in the ballpark of book time (average pace), you have to be able to laugh and walk at the same time. No slow pokes unless you can make me laugh so hard I can't move (think of a milk out the nose kind of laugh). If you come you MUST bring sugar in some form unless you are diabetic or something, and in that case you have to bring some consumable item that is like crack to you. Bring interesting things, be creative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will change all 'maybe' RSVPs to No on the Thursday before the hike, that way people who don't update their RSVP don't ruin the fun for others in the group. You must be in good shape and have hiking experience for this hike, just because this is silly doesn't mean it is a light hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream flavors can be requested, I am thinking I will get it from Christina's in Inman sq, but JP Licks is also a possibility. Contact me sooner if you want/need soy ice cream. Post in your RSVP if you want ice cream (I don't want to carry extra servings just for the fun of it). Also be sure to bring a spoon and a container to put blueberries in as well as maybe something to put the ice cream in when you eat it. Please be prepared to hike out what you hike in! This is about the journey... and it will be a silly one.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the guy in the silver Honda Civic with an extra crazy look in his eyes</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pete</member_name><member_id>4010848</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>14</waitlist_count><updated>1313429454000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305818628000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Return of the Great Blueberry Stumble 3.5 -stumbelier n sillier if possible</name><id>18970991</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313240400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/18970991/</event_url></item>
