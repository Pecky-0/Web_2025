Im hoping it's just as good down here.   If memory serves they do not take reservations so this will be first come first serve.  I have changed the time due to not wanting to wait for over an hour with people in tow.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefriendlytoast.net/" target="_blank"&gt;The Friendly Toast Restaurant Review&lt;/a&gt;:  featuring Almond Joy pancakes, gingerbread waffles, and thick French toast made from six types of homemade bread. The egg choices are dazzling and include crazy ingredients like Mexican sausage, Cuban dirty rice, kalamata olives and banana peppers. Equally outrageous is the d√©cor, which is like a 50?s version of Pee-Wee?s Playhouse. The shop?s bright green walls are filled with classic ads (Esso, Sunbeam bread, Magic-Cling bras); and kitschy memorabilia (Nancy Drew book covers, and an old Good Humor truck ice-cream menu). There?s also a female mannequin, strange vintage lampshades, and a large plastic hamburger with eyes and a droopy mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Ivy - be there by 3PM</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267560655000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265977815000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Friendly Toast in Kendall Square</name><id>12587936</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267387200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/12587936/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/d/global_13056701.jpeg</photo_url></item>
