As this is my first stab at leading this group (and my first event as well), I'm going to keep it simple and stay on the fire road for a loop that should take about 1.5 to 2 hours.  Dogs are welcome - I'll be bringing my boys.  Signs are posted for dogs to be leashed, but the ranger is reasonable as long as dogs are in control and will come when called.  We want to be considerate of those folks walking/biking who are afraid of dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Pennybrook Entrance at 11:00 and start the walk no later than 11:10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>11943825</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1285586063000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285159433000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lynn Woods Sunday Walk</name><id>14856592</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285513200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/14856592/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/2/5/global_11261669.jpeg</photo_url></item>
