&lt;p&gt;This volume brings together three of his intensely original novels, &lt;em&gt;Loving, Living&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Party Going&lt;/em&gt;. Green explored class distinctions through the medium of love. &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; brilliantly contrasts the lives of servants and masters in an Irish castle during World War Two; &lt;em&gt;Living&lt;/em&gt; of workers and owners in a Birmingham iron foundry, while &lt;em&gt;Party Going&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant comedy of manners, presenting a party of wealthy travellers stranded by fog in a London railway hotel while throngs of workers await trains in the station below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read and come prepared to talk about &lt;em&gt;Loving.&lt;/em&gt; If you get around to &lt;em&gt;Living&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Party Going&lt;/em&gt;, so will the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310997387000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309380458000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Green: Loving; Living; Party Going</name><id>24006361</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310940000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/24006361/</event_url></item>
