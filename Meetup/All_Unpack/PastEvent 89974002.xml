    This will be a special OM Healing circle, a beautiful process where we gather, form circles, say some prayers, create intentions, and then chant OM for 45 minutes. For this special event, our OM Healing vibrations will go toward those who have lost homes, loved ones and pets, and those who have been affected in any way from the superstorm. The healing energy from chanting OM, as we send it out to people in need, will also uplift ourselves. &lt;br /&gt;

     This program will be facilitated by Mark Kolenski, who was given a blessing to lead OM Healing Circles by Sri Swami Vishwandnda of the Atma Kriya organization. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    Sound and vibration are the essence of creation. Universally OM Healing can help uplift the environment and create harmony and unity for all beings and nature. Come join us for this evening, where your prayers, sounds and donations will contribute harmony during a time of profound need.</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judy Copp</member_name><member_id>8642061</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353799549000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1362498</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem MA Meditation Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352076937000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hurricane Relief Meetup with OM Healing</name><id>89974002</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353717000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Salem-MA-Meditation-Meetup-Group/events/89974002/</event_url></item>
