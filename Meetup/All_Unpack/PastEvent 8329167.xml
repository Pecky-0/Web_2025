O'Neil's CAN SLIMÂ® approach. Investing is about playing the probabilities. Thanks to O'Neil, we know what these probabilities are and how to use them to select winning stocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This talk is part of a series of interactive talks with Mike Kinkead at the Wednesday Boston IBD Meetup. Everyone is encouraged to contribute his or her experience and expertise to the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Talk led by Doug Roberts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug has delivered his Market Talk ever since we moved to MIT. The banter in our group of bulls versus bears has become vigorous as the market alternately rallies and tumbles. Join this discussion as Doug gives his perspective on fundamentals, technicals and sentiment. Doug is one of the leaders of the group and is a full-time trader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets starting at 5:30 PM to get more meat into the meetings.
