I know I`m putting this one together on very short notice but I think it sounds like a good idea. I would like to do this as a exercise walk, but I would also like to keep it fun, and we`ll go at the fastest pace of the slowest walker, so no one gets left behind. We can meet at Johnston Memorial Park at 3:30 and then walk until dusk, and then head over to the Atwood Grille for some grub and beverage. If there are people who do not want to do the walk they can still join us at the Grille, @ 5:00 p.m.I was told that they have call ahead seating for 8 or more, and that reservations could also be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to add that this is a 2 part meet up, and I`ll try to make arrangements for all @ the grille for 5:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
