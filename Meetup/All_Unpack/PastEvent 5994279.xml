Tubing on the Farmington River. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satan's Kingdom State Recreation Area, located on Route 44 in New Hartford, CT. Free parking, changing houses, restrooms and shuttle service back to the starting point are available. When you're ready to go, wait in line to sign waiver papers and rent your tube and life jacket. $20 cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.5 mile tubing run is more calm than wild, but you will encounter 3 sets of rapids. It isn't for everyone...you must know how to swim. The 2nd set of rapids can toss you off your tube. Depending on the weather conditions, if the water is high, the current can be strong in places. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, go into their website www.farmingtonrivertubing.com. It will give you more info and tips on what to wear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it rains we will reschedule for the week or some other day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda says:&lt;br /&gt;I would love to be there, but I don't swim. Al will take the reigns (pun). He loves the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a group discount rate of $14 pp if more than 10 people sign up. So RSVP early and i will see if i met the rules for the time ?? with firm plans. Al will be in charge of making the reservations for the group. Maybe Al will announce this to his group as well so we will have more people. If this date isn't good, Al will change it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i see Steve posted it a week earlyier than the one Linda posted so why not make the change ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK Getting There:&lt;br /&gt;From Hartford...&lt;br /&gt;Head toward Avon/Canton via rte 44...&lt;br /&gt;Right after canton, rte 44 and 202 split, take rte 44  split to the north for about 2.5 miles, look for the Satins Kingdom on the right.&lt;br /&gt;Pull on in and look for the cones on the car..oh its a blue Toyota Avalon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map quest, GPS and others, use 112 Main Street (rte 44) new hartford, ct  to get you close enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate Steves group will arrive about 1:30&lt;br /&gt;so thats a good time for us too..maybe eat some snacks there first..&lt;br /&gt; Ok got to go now...&lt;br /&gt;al-r&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184607126000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183951534000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tubing Down The Farmington River on Saturday with other fellow Meetup.com groups</name><id>5994279</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184434200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5994279/</event_url></item>
