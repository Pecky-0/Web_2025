There is no driveable access road into the cemetery itself, one must park on Flynt Street and walk a short distance along a defunct road branching off of Flynt Street. (This defunct road was blocked off by large rocks as of 2002).&lt;br /&gt;There is another entrance which is gated, near Burleigh Park.The Hidden Cemetery contains very old graves dating back to early 1700, the newest being 1997.
