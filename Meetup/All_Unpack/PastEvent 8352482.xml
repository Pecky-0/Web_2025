If this is the first time you are getting this, it will be last minute notice, but here it is.&lt;br /&gt;   On Thursday, July 17, at 7:30pm we will be having our monthly meditation class. It is a great class for people who want to begin to learn to meditate, and also for those who have tried it and are interested in finding out how to meditate as a way of connecting to God inside. All are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In peace,&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Johanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
