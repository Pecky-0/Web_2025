Michael and his two Puggies have invited us to their home in Weymouth.  They've never been to a Puggie meetup before, so the meetup has decided to come to them.  Don't worry, the yard is fully fenced - Michael ran outside to check it for holes before agreeing to do the meetup - and there is shade as well.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of parking available, or at least I hope there is!  Please bring folding chairs.  The group has grown big enough so that there probably won't be enough resident chairs to go around...    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluids will be provided, but now we are counting on our various meetup members to bring the goodies - since they've already been doing a bang up job of packing the table with tasty treats for Pugs and owners alike.   It isn't just the Pugs who stuff themselves at these meetups... your faithful organizer manages to go home with an extra pound or two on board every single time!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT FEED CLOVIS!  He has a damaged brain stem and has trouble swallowing.  Imagine a Pug who has trouble swallowing!  (Okay, you can feed him bits of soft food broken into tiny pieces... are you happy now, Clovis?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetup is on the SECOND Sunday of September.  See you then!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all of the regulars and a few new folks showed up for the fun!  Pug Charley brought FIVE family members and his Puggie cousin Zoey.  Since joining his new family last month, he has a snazzy new harness and a great big smile.  Little 12 week old Templeton attended his very first meetup, Mom wasn't too sure he was big enough to stand up to the crowd by himself, but as you can see from the pictures, he did just fine - chasing the big boys and girls around and around until they were dizzy, and bowling over poor Sadie whenever he could catch her!  Those dignified old ladypugs, Cora and Belle were there too - I think it was their first meetup?  You're never too old to party!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Sharon for making her home and her marvelous fenced yard available as a venue for our Sunday Pug socials.  I cannot imagine a better place!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful time was had by all, and we hope you will be able to attend the next meetup! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192114630000</updated><rating><average>4.90999984741</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186945545000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug September Meetup</name><id>6168057</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189965600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/6168057/</event_url></item>
