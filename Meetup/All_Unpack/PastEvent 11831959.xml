Parts of the trail, particularly&lt;br /&gt;south of the Passaconaway Cutoff, are wet, though recent&lt;br /&gt;relocations have improved the situation. Grades are mostly easy.&lt;br /&gt;The part of the trail south of the Passaconaway Cutoff is in the&lt;br /&gt;Sandwich Range Wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;The trail follows the gravel road beyond the gate for 125 yd., turns&lt;br /&gt;sharp left (sign) on a cross-country ski trail that it follows for&lt;br /&gt;another 125 yd., then turns sharp right on the old route of the trail.&lt;br /&gt;It crosses an old railroad bed and a recent logging road, then&lt;br /&gt;bears right onto an old railroad grade along the west side of&lt;br /&gt;Oliverian Brook (in the reverse direction, bear left here) and&lt;br /&gt;follows it, passing a beaver pond that sometimes floods the trail.&lt;br /&gt;Then it turns left off the railroad grade, and at the Passaconaway&lt;br /&gt;Cutoff diverges right (southwest).&lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Passaconaway Cutoff 43° 58' 14&amp;quot; 71° 20' 58&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;1.70 mi 1 hr 24 min +1053 ft on Passaconaway Cutoff&lt;br /&gt;3.60 mi 2 hr 30 min +1292 ft This trail provides the shortest route to Mt. Passaconaway from&lt;br /&gt;the north, running from the Oliverian Brook Trail, to the Square&lt;br /&gt;Ledge Trail (and thence to the summit via the Walden Trail). The&lt;br /&gt;entire trail is in the Sandwich Range Wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the Oliverian Brook Trail, the cutoff follows an old logging&lt;br /&gt;road at easy grades, crosses a brook, then runs above the brook.&lt;br /&gt;Then it turns left and climbs steadily, with glimpses of Mt.&lt;br /&gt;Passaconaway across the valley. It climbs over a ledge with a&lt;br /&gt;view north to Hedgehog Mountain and continues up to the&lt;br /&gt;junction with the Square Ledge Trail west of Square Ledge.&lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Square Ledge Trail 43° 57' 07&amp;quot; 71° 22' 02&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;0.60 mi 33 min -170 ft on Square Ledge Trail&lt;br /&gt;4.20 mi 3 hr 3 min +1122 ft This trail begins at the junction of the Old Mast Rd. and the&lt;br /&gt;Walden and Lawrence trails, climbs over Square Ledge, and&lt;br /&gt;ascends to the Walden Trail just below the summit cone of Mt.&lt;br /&gt;Passaconaway. It is entirely within the Sandwich Range&lt;br /&gt;Wilderness. In some recent years, peregrine falcons have nested&lt;br /&gt;on the cliff of Square Ledge, so access to the principal Square&lt;br /&gt;Ledge viewpoint may be restricted during the nesting season&lt;br /&gt;(April 1 to August 1).&lt;br /&gt;The trail ascends to the junction with the Passaconaway Cutoff on&lt;br /&gt;the left. It descends steeply down a shoulder then ascends&lt;br /&gt;alongside a rock face. A side&lt;br /&gt;path climbs right up a steep ledge with a view of Mt.&lt;br /&gt;Passaconaway (use caution—the edge of the cliff is partly&lt;br /&gt;obscured by scrubby growth). The main trail ascends to the&lt;br /&gt;wooded summit of the knob.&lt;br /&gt;to Square Ledge 43° 57' 12&amp;quot; 71° 21' 38&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;0.60 mi 33 min +170 ft on Square Ledge Trail&lt;br /&gt;4.80 mi 3 hr 36 min +1292 ft Leaving the ledge, the trail ascends to the wooded summit of the&lt;br /&gt;knob above the ledge. Just past this summit an unmarked side&lt;br /&gt;path climbs left up a steep ledge with a view of Mt. Passaconaway&lt;br /&gt;(use caution—the edge of the cliff is partly obscured by scrubby&lt;br /&gt;growth). The main trail descends alongside a rock face, then&lt;br /&gt;climbs steeply up a shoulder, turns sharp right, and descends to&lt;br /&gt;the junction with the Passaconaway Cutoff on the right.&lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Passaconaway Cutoff 43° 57' 07&amp;quot; 71° 22' 02&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;1.70 mi 1 hr 24 min -1053 ft on Passaconaway Cutoff&lt;br /&gt;6.50 mi 5 hr 0 min +240 ft The cutoff leaves the junction with the Square Ledge Trail west of&lt;br /&gt;Square Ledge. It descends to a ledge with a view north to&lt;br /&gt;Hedgehog Mountain, then descends steadily with glimpses of Mt.&lt;br /&gt;Passaconaway across the valley. It runs above a brook then&lt;br /&gt;crosses it then follows an old logging road at easy grades to the&lt;br /&gt;Oliverian Brook Trail.&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;Distance Time Elev&lt;br /&gt;Change&lt;br /&gt;Trail / Waypoint Latitude Longitude&lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Oliverian Brook Trail 43° 58' 14&amp;quot; 71° 20' 58&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;1.90 mi 1 hr 6 min -240 ft on Oliverian Brook Trail&lt;br /&gt;8.40 mi 6 hr 6 min 0 ft The Passaconaway Cutoff diverges east (southwest). The trail&lt;br /&gt;turns onto the railroad grade and passes a beaver pond that&lt;br /&gt;sometimes floods the trail. It follows along the west side of the&lt;br /&gt;brook, bears left off of the old grade and crosses a recent logging&lt;br /&gt;road. It crosses an old railroad bed then turns onto a relocated&lt;br /&gt;section of trail, using a cross-country ski trail. It leaves the ski trail&lt;br /&gt;(sign) and follows a gravel road to the gate.&lt;br /&gt;to Oliverian Brook Trailhead 43° 59' 38&amp;quot; 71° 21' 01&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;The Oliverian Brook Trail begins at a parking lot 0.1 mi. in from&lt;br /&gt;the Kancamagus Highway on a gravel road that begins on the&lt;br /&gt;south side of the highway, 1 mi. west of the Bear Notch Rd.&lt;br /&gt;intersection.&lt;br /&gt;8.40 mi 6 hr 6 min 0 ft Totals&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has signed up for The New England Hiking and Adventurer's group is probably fully aware that there are risks involved with outdoor activities.
