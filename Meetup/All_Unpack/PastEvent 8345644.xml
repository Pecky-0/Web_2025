Do you like David Hasselhoff, Bette Midler,&lt;br /&gt;Julio Iglesias and Barbara Streisand? Then you're a little bit old&lt;br /&gt;and this month's Green Drinks is in honor of YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Green Drinks committee heard that old people think Green Drinks is&lt;br /&gt;just for us kids. Well poop damn! Just because you're getting gray&lt;br /&gt;doesn't mean you can't be green too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us Pirates this Wednesday, July 16th and get some serious booty&lt;br /&gt;from 6:00-8:00pm at Anchor Bar, 272 College Street, New Haven, CT,&lt;br /&gt;(203) 865-1512.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month Sunlight Solar, a leading photovoltaic design and&lt;br /&gt;installation contractor, will be explaining the process of solar&lt;br /&gt;installation in Connecticut. And avast! Anchor has gotten us some of&lt;br /&gt;the best deals we've seen yet on grog – a dollar off everything – well&lt;br /&gt;cocktails $3 and all beers between $2-4! But that's not all! IF&lt;br /&gt;YOU'RE OLD YOU GET IN FOR FREE! (and so does everyone else but old&lt;br /&gt;people don't read lowercase.) Anyone who brings a walker or wears an&lt;br /&gt;eye-patch the whole night gets a free drink on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to walk, bike, wheelchair, hobble or carpool to the event.&lt;br /&gt;And bring your AARP card just for fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there ... unless it's past your bedtime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- New Haven Green Drinks&lt;br /&gt;newhavengreendrinks @gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine &amp; Melissa</member_name><member_id>3632860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216419059000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216144302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Green Drinks goes Solar</name><id>8345644</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216245600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8345644/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
