This workshop is designed for couples but single people are also welcome to attend.  Here is a description from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;”Herb has been teaching relationship communication courses for 30 years. Even though most communication is affected by personality more than gender, gender differences play a major role. Herb will present information from his life and work and also based on a very revealing book &amp;quot;We Have to Talk&amp;quot; by Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey, a Cambridge couple. We will also have a gender dialogue in the group after the information is presented. Don't miss this special event! .”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring or share our own food as long as it is vegetarian.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292693985000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290315560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gender Dialogues - Effective Ways for Men and Women to Communicate</name><id>15514072</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292630400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/15514072/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/8/global_7203288.jpeg</photo_url></item>
