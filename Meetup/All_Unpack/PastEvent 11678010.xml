Seven of us got thrown out at 10:05 while still playing and having fun.  &lt;br /&gt;Great Toilet Seat Cribbage Board was given out to Larry (not because it was a toilet seat, I don't think), but he had already bought a Beer Keg Cribbage Board for himself  :)  &lt;br /&gt;I skunked someone by 1 point I think Debbie? And yes, lots of other skunking going around, probably why we got thrown out...&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Jane who is a newbie, perhaps she needs the toilet seat?? and thanks to Karen for showing her the ropes and how to win at cribbage by beating Micki, and for taking her home.  &lt;br /&gt;Bette, Emad and Micki had a grand ole time playing cribbage backwards (by trying to lose and not to win).  That's why we were laughing so hard and telling Polish jokes for Noelle, and those four were laughing and having a great skunking time also. &lt;br /&gt;Welcomed back Duane who was one of the four along with Dave, who I think got skunked, and Larry.&lt;br /&gt;Boy do we stay up late or what?  Must be having F*U*N&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the back with our cribbage boards out !</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Micki E</member_name><member_id>4468648</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257462740000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cribbage Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WalthamCribbage</urlname><id>378600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Cribbage!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256138786000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waltham Cribbage Meet-Up - Welcome to November Turkeys    :)</name><id>11678010</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257289200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WalthamCribbage/events/11678010/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/3/7/global_10878823.jpeg</photo_url></item>
