This 10 mile trip is the perfect outing and would be a day-trip and includes lunch on the river. The cost is about $80 bucks. You could say this is a &amp;quot;hike&amp;quot; on the water. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first half of the day offers fun, easy rapids such as &amp;quot;Freight Train&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pinball.&amp;quot; Calm sections allow your guide to fill you in on local history and enjoy the breathtaking scenery. About half-way through the trip, the rafts approach &amp;quot;Zoar Gap,&amp;quot; the day's biggest rapid. After safely navigating this exciting stretch, we serve a hearty riverside picnic lunch. The second half of the trip has fun spots such as &amp;quot;Roger Rapid&amp;quot; and opportunities to get out of the boat and float. This trip is the perfect introduction to whitewater rafting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Place: &lt;br /&gt;Crab Apple on the Deerfield - Charlemont, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this one is Martha (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2559645/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;) so please direct questions to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Please register your intent ASAP so we can make the reservation.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Do not pay via PayPal.
