&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participate in a night of “being” and “playing” in the brilliant flow of angel energy. You   will see why nothing is fully preplanned when a evening with the angels is scheduled, as trusting their Divine guidance brings a wonderful element of surprise and joy! All we need do is gather together with loving hearts and open minds and enjoy how the angels orchestrate our time together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The angels are looking forward to:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whispering their messages to you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dancing with you to the melodies of your soul,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showing you their unconditional love,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listening to your needs as you ASK,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bringing you: peace of mind, solutions and the gift of connecting with each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…….See you there. It will truly be an honor to meet you all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light-filled blessings,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WELCOME:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you interested in fun and simply, a healthier way of eating? Are you suffering from a health condition that may be food or lifestyle related? (85% of chronic diseases are)! The purpose of the Meetup: Cape Cod Raw is to gather and support people who want to transition into a healthier way of eating. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Wherever you are in this process, there are great ways to transition. Even if you are just attempting this for the first time, you will gain valuable information and support on food choices, on an acid/alkaline balance lifestyle, and on enjoying an abundant life that for many are our heart's desire. This Meetup group shares information related to raw food and holistic lifestyle.  We gather for demos, lectures and other related events that encourage a vegan and raw lifestyle. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Do some of us eat cooked food? Yes, of course we do. However, for optimal cellular health, we love eating raw, live food. We welcome the newbie, the curious and the seasoned raw foodist. &lt;br /&gt;
