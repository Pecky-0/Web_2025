Jeff Carreira is EnlightenNext's Director of Education, and has been Andrew Cohen's personal assistant for over six years. He created &lt;br /&gt;and designed an introductory course on Cohen's teachings of Evolutionary Enlightenment that is being taught literally all over the world (www.eecourse.org). He also produced a 10 day international teacher training course for the course, and continues to create new curriculum to communicate and teach people how to practically apply the transformative power of Evolutionary Enlightenment. &lt;br /&gt;Don't miss this meeting!!!
