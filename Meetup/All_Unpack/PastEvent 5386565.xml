NLP has some great stuff for personal and group change, and we'll be doing both this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your courage, your vision, your passion, and your curiousity when you show up on February 22.  As always, both newcomers and experts (and anyone in between) are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  A reminder that the venue has changed.  In response to feedback, we are changing to a quieter, non-restaurant forum.
