As I know you all like to laugh, I am excited to announce that I am teaching a weekly Yin and Laughter Yoga class in central square at a wonderful studio called the Breathing Room right above the Life Alive resaturant. Just buzz in to the door immeidiately to the right of Life Alive. The class is every Monday at noon and you ccan pre-register online at thebreathingroomboston.com. Price info is $15 to drop in and dicounted rates if you pre-register and if you are a student or financial difficulty of any sort. Yin is a type of deep stretchig yoga that will open us up to just relax and laugh together. If you have any questions please let me know.
