We're starting with our first &amp;quot;JP Pub Crawl&amp;quot; event this month, with more to follow in September, October and beyond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alchemist Lounge is a new addition to the JP pub/restaurant/nightlife circuit. Great food - very tasty, ample portions and very reasonably priced. Very mellow Lounge atmosphere in the pub/bar section [and big screen TV for Red Sox games], with separate formal dining area available too. Live music over weekends too, later on in the evening (after the RedSox finish playing!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alchemistlounge.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Alchemist Lounge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions: &lt;br /&gt;Goto the Alchemist Lounge web-site. &lt;br /&gt;Click on &amp;quot;Hours &amp;amp; Directions&amp;quot; to get map &amp;amp; directions from CitySearch.  &lt;br /&gt;There is limited parking on the street; public parking lots available nearby on Center Street (Spring Park Ave) and by the Hi-Lo Foods Minimarket on Hyde Square. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Transport: &lt;br /&gt;Take the Green Line E Branch to the end (Heath Street). Transfer to a #39 bus which will &lt;br /&gt;take you south on S. Huntington Ave, right by the Lounge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE RSVP TO LET US KNOW IF YOU ARE COMING SO THAT WE CAN BOOK A TABLE &amp;amp;/OR ELBOW-ROOM AT THE BAR!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187180897000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185831799000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>JP Pub Crawl #1</name><id>6100228</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186786800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/6100228/</event_url></item>
