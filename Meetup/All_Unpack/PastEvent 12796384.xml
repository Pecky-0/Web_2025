It may be best known for one of its owners- Bruins legend Ray Bourque. But it's a lovely restaurant with good food. We'll begin with our usual cocktail hour in the lounge from 6:00-7:00 for those who can get there early and want to meet other members. Then we'll go up to the 2nd floor for Restaurant Week dinner- 3 courses for $33. (+7% tax, 18% tip &amp;amp; drinks) Check out the menu-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://restaurantweekboston.com/?neighborhood=north-end&amp;amp;meal=any&amp;amp;page=2" target="_blank"&gt;http://restaurantweek...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be best to bring cash, as we won't get individual tabs. The restaurant is located on the right side of upper Hanover St. as you walk from the Greenway. Afterwards, for those with a little more time, we'll slide over to Caffe Paradiso for coffee &amp;amp; dessert. It promises to be an excellent evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further event guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the bar until 7:00.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269558759000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267831067000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tresca-Restaurant Week Dinner</name><id>12796384</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269385200000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/12796384/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
