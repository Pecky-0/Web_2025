There is no sign but the entrance is very visible and is right across from a little garden stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please arrive so that we can depart at 10:00AM.  We'll figure out out route beased on group interest and plan on being on the water 3 hours. As always FUN is first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do remember the water is still quite cold so dress accordingly and have spare warm layers in a dri bag just in case. PFD mandatory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken C</member_name><member_id>7777174</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271859593000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271596073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Minute Patriots Day Padle-E.
