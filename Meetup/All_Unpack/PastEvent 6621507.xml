In the midst of the Marsh Garden's beautiful greenhouses, while live jazz is playing, her work will be shown.   The show is 5:30pm to 9pm (though I don't know how long I'll personally stay) The show itself runs through Dec 14th, but I thought it would be fun to go to the opening.  Let me know your thoughts! You can check out her art at www.clinard.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devorah is your contact: 203-314-4329&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Marsh Gardens can be kind of confusing if you've never been there (though I've only been there once!).  There's nothing really near there, like a cafe, to meet at - but I can be at the corner of Edwards and Prospect from 5:20 to 5:40 if people would like to walk over together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't anticipate it being such a large show that we wouldn't see one another.  If I'm not there and it's after 6:15, that means I've probably already left - but stay and enjoy the art!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195425541000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193415720000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Clinard Sculpture Show Opening</name><id>6621507</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195252200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6621507/</event_url></item>
