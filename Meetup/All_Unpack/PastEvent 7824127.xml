A few people suggested this location, so we will give it a try. Here are the books that you and the rest of the members chose in our recent poll:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert &lt;br /&gt;The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory &lt;br /&gt;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell &lt;br /&gt;Fly Paper for Freaks by Christine Peetz &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll read one book per month in the order listed starting in May. We'll meet on May 18th to avoid interfering with Memorial Day weekend plans. Here's a description of Eat, Pray, Love:&lt;br /&gt;Gilbert (The Last American Man) grafts the structure of romantic fiction upon the inquiries of reporting in this sprawling yet methodical travelogue of soul-searching and self-discovery. Plagued with despair after a nasty divorce, the author, in her early 30s, divides a year equally among three dissimilar countries, exploring her competing urges for earthly delights and divine transcendence. First, pleasure: savoring Italy's buffet of delights--the world's best pizza, free-flowing wine and dashing conversation partners--Gilbert consumes la dolce vita as spiritual succor. &amp;quot;I came to Italy pinched and thin,&amp;quot; she writes, but soon fills out in waist and soul. Then, prayer and ascetic rigor: seeking communion with the divine at a sacred ashram in India, Gilbert emulates the ways of yogis in grueling hours of meditation, struggling to still her churning mind. Finally, a balancing act in Bali, where Gilbert tries for equipoise &amp;quot;betwixt and between&amp;quot; realms, studies with a merry medicine man and plunges into a charged love affair. Sustaining a chatty, conspiratorial tone, Gilbert fully engages readers in the year's cultural and emotional tapestry--conveying rapture with infectious brio, recalling anguish with touching candor--as she details her exotic tableau with history, anecdote and impression.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charis</member_name><member_id>3696786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264377239000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209339001000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May book discussion</name><id>7824127</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211140800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/7824127/</event_url></item>
