This event is a cross post with our friends at MetroWest Walking Group-thanks Lisa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to be geocaching as we hike, what is that you ask? Geocaching (pronounced geo-cashing) is a worldwide game of hiding and seeking treasure. A geocacher can place a geocache in the world, pinpoint its location using GPS technology and then share the geocache's&amp;quot;&amp;gt;geocache's existence and location online. Anyone with a GPS device can then try to locate the geocache. There are a few caches at this park and we will put our collective intelligences together to find them-wander we will...but with a purpose! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three of us will have devices and we will be hunting for treasure in the park (depending on how many attend, we may break into teams). If you have ever wanted to know about geocaching or just like a good puzzle and sleuthing adventure, then you will love this event! We will also be sending off a new travel bug...just to 'bug' you I won't explain more unless you attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read more about geocaching, go to the website at: &lt;br /&gt;www.geocaching.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting at the park entrance at 9:00. &lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From East or west: Rt. 9 west to Rt. 30 exit, right at first set of lights to Edgell Road to Belknap Road (left), right onto Millwood Street to entrance on left across from golf course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will know me by the large spotty dog accompanying me (no he is not a bloodhound-has yet to find anything with his nose except my french fries!). My cell is also 401-487-5273. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear comfortable shoes that have some traction. I will bring the bug spray (not fond of those little blood suckers). Any questions, email or call me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: You may become addicted to Geocaching-it is fun!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Karren will be by the park entrance and accompanied by a large spotty dog.
