This month Dj Hernan and Tambó Presents The Zafire Dance Project from NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zafire Dance Project is born from well-known and recognized dancers, Carlos (Hernandez) &amp;amp; Arlette (Guerra). &lt;br /&gt;

Carlos and Arlette are two of the top, established dancers in NYC. Both have careers as professional dancers, and have teamed up to become one of the most sought-after couples for performances and workshops, in congresses and events, world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their team performances have been described as delightful, inspiring and simply a dedicated team showing their best. Do not miss their performances this month at Tambó.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also we offer salsa lessons at 6pm with Metamovements a dancing/gymnastics company in the Boston area, led by Anara Piers Frank. Learn the basics, intermediate steps and if we are in the Cuban mood, some Rueda Dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those looking for their Salsa Gear, we will have Shoegaloo in the house, with the best in dance-inspired shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
