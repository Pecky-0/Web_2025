 The CenterStage at Fitchburg State University arts and culture series invites you to be transported to the Emerald Isle when the celebrated Irish ensemble Lúnasa performs on Saturday, Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. in Weston Auditorium, 353 North St.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lúnasa’s melodic lines soar as flutes, fiddles, whistles, and uillean pipe capture the ancient soul of traditional instrumental Irish music-and then surge into the 21st century with the rhythmic drive of the double bass. Experience what the Irish Voice calls “the hottest Irish acoustic group on the planet.” No wonder Irish Echo named Lúnasa’s CD one of Top Ten Traditional Albums of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the enjoyment of the evening are step-dance performances by the Fitchburg State dance club and Flying Irish Dance Studio from Ashby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance is preceded by a spotlight talk at 7:15 p.m. with members of the band. While many Celtic bands feature a singer to carry its melodies, Lúnasa has taken a different path. Members of this band discuss how their instrumentation evokes the singer’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets for the concert are $28 for adults, $25 for seniors and $7 for students. The Weston Box Office, located inside Weston Auditorium, is open Thursdays and Fridays from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. and can be reached at 978-665-3347.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda R</member_name><member_id>54538602</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361679310000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360630545000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Something different ...
