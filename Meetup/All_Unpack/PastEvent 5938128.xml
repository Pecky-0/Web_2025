It starts early, and ends whenever Barbara kicks out us! It's a lot easier to make friends when you've got something to do together, right? Expect lots of conversation and maybe some dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to turn some yardwork into a kind of party, replete with food, splashing in water, lounging, and power tools. And what chainsaw garden party would be complete without watching chainsaw-related movies? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is done with the Nashua Friends Group.  See Barbara.  I &lt;br /&gt;will not be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://friends.meetup.com/196/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3114412"&gt;More Information Here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAIN PLANS: If it is actually raining in the morning, the party is cancelled. Otherwise, we'll take our chances! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183473412000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Gamers</urlname><id>393834</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Greater Nashua Gamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182879150000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chainsaw Garden Party III!</name><id>5938128</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183300200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/events/5938128/</event_url></item>
