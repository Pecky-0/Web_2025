The music can be heard while browsing berries, lettuce, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Market is open 11a-4p.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music starts at noon and continues until 2p. I'll be there at NOON and will carry&lt;br /&gt;a purple frisbee, at least one wooden director's chair with&lt;br /&gt;green fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town provides some seats and tables.  I'll try to bring a&lt;br /&gt;little more seating in case.  The music talent is usually&lt;br /&gt;tight, professional, and good sounding.  The stage is on the&lt;br /&gt;lower green, tunes are beamed towards the mayor's office from&lt;br /&gt;about 75 yards away.  Below Destefano's office the organic&lt;br /&gt;vendors operate their stands.  Makes for a nice scene, with&lt;br /&gt;rampant jaywalking across Church street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a lettuce mix last time that I couldn't stop eating.  I&lt;br /&gt;think this may point up some inadequacies in my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's good to support the farmer's and good to give the&lt;br /&gt;musicians a crowd to play to.  The first week this year, on&lt;br /&gt;7/11, attendance was light, but the band was very solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blues, Berries &amp;amp; Jam is what they call this Wednesday&lt;br /&gt;concert/farmer's market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come along and bring friends if you like.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Rob&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541783000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184697002000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>City Farmers' Market, 12-2p concert, Lower New Haven Green</name><id>6036969</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184774400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6036969/</event_url></item>
