The meetup will likely be at Panera but I will decide for sure later. The next closest book, The Time Traveler's Wife, also had several votes so I will also post the May meetup in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy reading,&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have my copy of the book on the table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264377265000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238083879000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Meetup - A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier (Ishmael Beah)</name><id>10041370</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240167600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/10041370/</event_url></item>
