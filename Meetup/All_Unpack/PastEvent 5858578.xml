My thanks to you guys for alerting me with enough time to amend this. It's time to try something different. I'd say its a good time to check out the Metro Rock in Newburyport. This way, those of you who have memberships won't have to pay for another day pass and anyone who has been to Everett already won't have to register again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll still say 11 AM even though this one is definitely a bit more off the beaten path for you guys in and around Boston. If you are unable to go due to lack of a ride I encourage you to post a message in the forum and see if someone is able to offer a carpool. I think it will be a great experience and what better time to go then when there is the comp at our usual venue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/n-directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181660787000</updated><rating><average>2.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181093337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Sunday Climb</name><id>5858578</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181487600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/5858578/</event_url></item>
