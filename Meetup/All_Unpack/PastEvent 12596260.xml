As their stories intersect--and the film's narrative shifts back and forth in time--we witness a dramatic collision of different worlds and the tragic consequences of enemies living as neighbors. (Kino International)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the pleasures of &lt;b&gt;Ajami&lt;/b&gt;, a tough and in many ways unsparing movie, is its deep immersion in the beats and melodies of everyday life in Jaffa and beyond. You emerge from &lt;b&gt;Ajami&lt;/b&gt; moved and also a little worn out, but mostly grateful for the heart, craft and intelligence the movie has shown. NY Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry if you miss some details; this is the kind of movie that rewards a second viewing. NY Daily News&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the extent that its sympathies lie with the occupied and with those who must do the work of enforcing occupation, &lt;b&gt;Ajami&lt;/b&gt; brings a warmly generous spirit to its subjects, almost all of whom become gangsters by default. No one is demonized or sanctified. The movie's sensibilities are humanistic. Village Voice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stylish and important step towards forming a more compelling, bravely engaging portrayal of a country in turmoil without disregarding its hypocrisies, corruption and seemingly never-ending suffering.
