<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join us for a discussion of Chapter 7 of &amp;quot;The Artist's Way&amp;quot; or Chapter 6 of &amp;quot;Finding Water.&amp;quot; Chapter 7 is &amp;quot;Recovering a Sense of Connection.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll take up topics from the chapters, including inspiration, resolve, creative risks, and a sense of connection. If we choose, we can work with one or more of the exercises from the chapters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other weeks, there will also be time for general discussion. If the past is any guide, we'll compare notes on creative interests, exchange information about resources we've found useful, share inspirations for artist date sites, and serve as sounding boards for one another's ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you think about it, each of our meetups puts &amp;quot;a sense of connection&amp;quot; into action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a copy of the book you're following and a pen or pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information on finding either book is on the message board (under &amp;quot;discussions&amp;quot;). Information about parking and public transportation near Gallery 263 can also be found on the message board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: tomato"&gt;**Please note that we are still meeting at 7pm **&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;If you are able, please bring a $5 donation to the Gallery for the use of their space -- thank you!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will greet you at the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>8367984</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269731504000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Artists and Creators!</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Artists-Way-Boston-area</urlname><id>1471304</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Artists Way Boston Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266541491000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Artist's Way Cambridge Meetup</name><id>wqsdnynfbhc</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269558000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Artists-Way-Boston-area/events/12643108/</event_url></item>
