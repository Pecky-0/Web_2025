We can certainly pick a movie backup too, but I've got a short-ish piece of lore to recommend that people read if they haven't already. We can do pizza or other takeout, since it's a week-night, so bring a few bucks if you want to get dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we're going to talk about a particular piece of lore, we suggest Hrafnkel's saga (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrafnkels_saga" class="linkified"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrafnkels_saga&lt;/a&gt;). It's an Icelandic saga with a lot of really good stuff in it. One of the things that we liked was it showed someone as "Frey's Godi" which was one of the rarer times (for us) to see someone dedicate themselves to one god(dess) in the lore. But it also shows it with more proper world view, without any modern woo attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
