The only movie theatre I know of that it's playing at is Boston Common 19. Also, did anyone want to meet up before the movie this time for like McDonalds or something? The movie starts at 7:20 so if you wanted to meet up before we could get together at like 6:30 at McDee's or if you want to meet up right before the movie you can meet up at the concession stand before 7:10. Email me back. rsdragon@optonline.net &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540146000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1142730514000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MEDFORD/BOSTON MOVIE GOERS FAN MEETUP GROUP Meetup</name><id>4879740</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1145745000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/4879740/</event_url></item>
