And remember, you can always update your RSVP as your plans change. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a blonde with a long black apron. But you can "check in" yourself at the table near the door. Just sign in, pick up a name tag and drop off payment (and drop off your swap, cards, if applicable).
