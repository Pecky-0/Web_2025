<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are &lt;b&gt;meeting in East Cambridge Sunday Dec 13th 3PM  to 6PM&lt;/b&gt; to collaborate, arrange, &lt;b&gt;rehearse&lt;/b&gt; and record member's songs.  This effort will also progress towards playing out at &lt;b&gt;open Mikes and making a CD&lt;/b&gt;, for those interested.  Eventually we will have comprehensive shows with everyone at a local Cambridge Clubs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your songs &amp;amp; ideas, and if you are new think of the &lt;b&gt;3 major goals&lt;/b&gt; you would like you accomplish in this group, so that can be incorporated in the agenda matrix.  If you have songs, try to &lt;b&gt;bring copies - chord charts &amp;amp; lyrics&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The official meetup time is 3 to 6PM&lt;/b&gt;, but if you can't make it for most of that, the extended time is from around 2PM until 7 PM,  I'll give the address later to &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; attendees and &amp;quot;maybes&amp;quot;, and my email to verify extended time hours.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will give exact address to attendees &amp; maybes</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>9500592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260926529000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260420705000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MEETUP # 3  Song Rehearsal, Jam, for Open Mikes &amp; Recording </name><id>12057372</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260734400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/12057372/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/global_11501162.jpeg</photo_url></item>
