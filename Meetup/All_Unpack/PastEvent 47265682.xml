Please RSVP now or ASAP as this event has been announced to 4 meetup groups and space will become limited due to capacity limits and the popularity of the game. The winner goes to the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is for the suburban&amp;nbsp;drinking buddies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives&amp;nbsp;have been organizing Patriots Game Watching Events over the past&amp;nbsp;3 months with up to 60 people attending at Boston, Wakefield and Woburn&amp;nbsp;venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we will&amp;nbsp;return to&amp;nbsp;one of our&amp;nbsp;suburban venues&amp;nbsp;on Sunday,&amp;nbsp;January 22 at 2:00pm&amp;nbsp;to watch the Patriots&amp;nbsp;play in the AFC Championship Game. We watched the Pats beat the Broncos at Harrington's&amp;nbsp;last month and had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great and the full menu is available for purchase. Owners Lisa and Dan have offerred us&amp;nbsp;sections of the first floor bar area to watch the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early at 2:00pm and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game time is 3:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people will stay for the NFC Championship Game that starts at 6:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's in front of Bank of America and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center and Commuter Rail accessible from North Station&amp;nbsp;by the&amp;nbsp;Haverhill Train stopping at Wakefield Station&amp;nbsp;with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion Street 1 block, right on to to Main Street and 1 block to Water Street. If you are joining us from the City and do not have a car the Commuter rail or bus&amp;nbsp;is the way to go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink.&amp;nbsp;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP early if you think you will attend. Invite guests, friends, and co-workers. Space may soon become limited&amp;nbsp;with all of the RSVPS from other participating groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following groups&amp;nbsp;are participating&lt;/p&gt;
