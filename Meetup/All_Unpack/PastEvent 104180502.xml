&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please come tomorrow.  Bring freinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give blood regularly with my two donor-buddies - David who is 67 and George who is 79, and gave today (Feb 11th). That makes me eligible on April 8th. Normally I would schedule something for that week but George heads to Florida for 8 weeks and will not return until mid April. David's birthday is April 25th so we will put off the donation for a couple of weeks and donate in Dedham at the Red Cross center on Thursday April 25th - David's 68th birthday. No better treat on one's birthday than to GIVE the gift of life with a great group of people. Soooo, come join us. If we get at least 15 people to join I will spring for a birthday cake and candles.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Rabinovitz</member_name><member_id>8471494</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366153448000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>40-plus</urlname><id>1222683</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2699966431</group_lon><name>40/50 Something Year Olds - Men &amp; Women Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360630703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buddy can you spare a pint... of blood?</name><id>104180502</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>21600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366131600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/40-plus/events/104180502/</event_url></item>
