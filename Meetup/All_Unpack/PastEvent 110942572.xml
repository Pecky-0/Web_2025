&lt;p&gt;AJ (me!) will host and is going to try and get a decent seat at 6:15, lecture starts at 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More info on the event can be found &lt;a href="http://onhsa.yale.edu/science-news-lecture-series-1"&gt;at this hyper-Link!&lt;/a&gt; (Don't try the Library's Website, they usually just reserve the room.)  Past lectures have been broken down into layman's terms quite well and lasted until just before 8pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's first come first serve FREE Parking near by in Yale's Lot 51 on Temple Street (Lot is between houses 302 and 320, across from the Library's rear exit).  Otherwise if parking you'd probably need to find a metered spot on Temple or Elm.  ($1.50/hr until 9pm.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Event description also promises light Snacks, but no details on them.  (Last time it was Insomnia Cookies and Juice/Coffee/Water.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Event is in the Community Public Room.  There's usually paper signs for "Science in the News" put up to lead you.  You can text 315-345-9348 if you don't see me, but phone will be off once lecture begins.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AJ</member_name><member_id>9920708</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364385132000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364223184000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Science Lecture: "The Secret Lives of Drugs and Vaccines"</name><id>110942572</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364336100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/110942572/</event_url></item>
