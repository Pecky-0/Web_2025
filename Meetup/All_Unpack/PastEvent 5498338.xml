Due to certain limitations, I can only post 1:30 or 1:45 as the starting time- better early than late!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a new print of &amp;quot;Becket&amp;quot; , the  historical epic set in 12th century England. King Henry II's  (Peter O'Toole) conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church have become tiresome for this secular and selfish leader. At an opportunate moment he appoints his old drinking buddy, Thomas Becket (Richard Burton) as the Archbishop. &amp;quot;Ahh, all is good and well now&amp;quot;, thinks Henry, &amp;quot;no more problems with Rome!&amp;quot; Becket, however turns the cards by taking his new appointment  seriously - as  the clash between Church and State becomes intensified and  the focal point of this film.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit this is heavy and heady stuff, but I think the discussion afterward should be provocative and thereby, fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Becket&amp;quot; was nominated for 12 Oscars in 1964. Here is a full review: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/1553/story/989812.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.startribun...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie will be hosted by Tom and as usual I  will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row after the film. Then its off to one of the local Kendall Sq. restaurants to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172514894000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172015187000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Becket": A Historical Epic at 1:40 at Kendall</name><id>5498338</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172341800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5498338/</event_url></item>
