The theme is "time" and your costume should be planned acccordingly. I am going as the white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland who is always running late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scavenger items have been posted but there are&amp;nbsp;additions&amp;nbsp;being added to the list. The prizes have been posted as well and they are way cool!. Go it alone or form a team of up to four people for the scavenger hunt. Bring you items the evening of the event, do your search the day of the event or even before! The house will be open as early as :00 PM for you together your team and begin to bring your loot to be tallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, all the normal Fabulous Foodies lack of rules apply. We'll do this as a pot luck because cooking in costumes could be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us, it is going to be great fun and the winner(s) of the scavenger hunt will recieve an amazing prize!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will email address and directions a few days before the party</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323190981000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317658775000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>It is Time for a Party!</name><id>35941302</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322953200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/35941302/</event_url></item>
