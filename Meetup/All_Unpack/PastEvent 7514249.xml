Again I didn't get to talk about Diet and Supplementation so in April I will begin with that information.  Sharing to follow if time allows.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handouts were passed on to all attendees for info on the next meeting.  Read over them in advance if possible and we'll be ready to dive into the diet and supplementation talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207869481000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>You'll love it because everyone here, while in pain and suffering, is dedicated to getting well and are proactive in that endeavor.</why><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205281103000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia April Meeting</name><id>7514249</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207696500000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/7514249/</event_url></item>
