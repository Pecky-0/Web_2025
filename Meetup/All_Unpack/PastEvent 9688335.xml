While traveling to S찾o Paulo, the couple explains Mauro that they will travel on vacation and will leave Mauro with his grandfather M처tel. Daniel promises to return before the first game of the Brazilian National Soccer Team in the Cup. The boy is left in Bom Retiro, a Jewish and Italian neighborhood, and waits for M처tel in front of his apartment. When the next door neighbor Shlomo arrives, he tells the boy that M처tel had just had a heart attack and died. Alone and without knowing where his parents are, the boy is lodged by Shlomo and the Jewish community. Through the young neighbor Hanna, Mauro makes new friends, cheers for the Brazilian team and sees the movement of the police and militaries on the streets while waiting for his parents. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857355/plotsummary" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/t...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Speaker: Manuella Meyer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Films start at 7:00 in the Life Sciences Building. &lt;br /&gt;For directions to Trinity, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/AboutTrinity/VisitingTrinity/DirectionsToTrinity.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trincoll.e...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or call (860) 297-2053.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/92062DC6-138A-430E-9ADA-5A209B506787/0/campusmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trincoll.e...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can come earlier than 6:45, please join me for supper in the Cave cafeteria (basement of Mather Hall, no id required).
