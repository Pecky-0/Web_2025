&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time for us to stomp on the angry &lt;em&gt;Hobbomock&lt;/em&gt; (aka "the sleeping giant"), who, according to one version of the Quinnipiac tribal legend, was cast into a digestive slumber to end his destructive ways, then laid to rest in what is now southwest CT.  Since then the Giant has had a rocky time of it, from the Mount Carmel Traprock Company and other quarrying operations.  Thanks to heroic efforts starting in 1924 and continuing today, this unusual east-west running trap rock ledge has been preserved and maintained for our hiking enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIKE PLAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A looping hike of moderate (at times strenuous) difficulty for the first half to get the juices flowing. For the first half we'll hike up the steep grade of the Giant's head on the blue trail, and will remain on the blue trail to the tower.  After taking in the view from the top, we'll return on the Tower Trail (gravel road) for an easy conclusion to the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mileage 2.5-3mi, elevation gain approx 500ft, moving speed 1.5-2mph.  Additions/alterations to this basic plan will be considered, especially on the return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at the parking lot across from Quinnipiac University at 10:15am. At this time of year, there should be no fee to park (normally $8 for CT residents). The hike will start from the trail head off of the parking lot. We would finish around 1pm and possibly head out to eat lunch if people feel inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
