This is a corn maze that requires a lot of patience to complete.  Not only does one try to navigate thru the maze, but also it includes trying to locate different clues.  In the past it has taken up to three hours to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is $16.95.  We will be meeting at 10:00 A.M. in the Davis Mega Maze parking lot located at 145 Redstone Hill, Sterling, MA 01564.  Dianne and I will be in a black four door Toyota Echo with Maine license plates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan will be to break up into four person teams and compete against each other.  We can even place a small friendly bet (e.g. the losers treat the winning team to an ice cream or something along this line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This outing promises to be a lot of fun (and quite a bit silly).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>DIANNE AND I WILL BE IN A BLACK FOUR DOOR TOYOTA ECHO WITH MAINE PLATES</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225116461000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223037088000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DAVIS MEGA MAZE</name><id>8887514</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224943200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8887514/</event_url></item>
