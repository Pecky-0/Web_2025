<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The divergent paths of three forty-something siblings collide when their mother, heiress to her uncle's exceptional 19th century art collection, dies suddenly. Left to come to terms with themselves and their differences, Adrienne (Juliette Binoche), a successful New York designer, Frederic (Charles Berling), an economist and university professor in Paris, and Jérémie (Jérémie Renier), a dynamic businessman in China, confront the end of childhood, their shared memories, background and unique vision of the future. Written and directed by &lt;b&gt;Olivier Assayas&lt;/b&gt; (Clean, Demonlover). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times Critic's Pick Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extraordinary film, which, in spite of its modest scale, tactful manner and potentially dowdy subject matter, is packed nearly to bursting with rich meaning and deep implication. . .while Mr. Assayas’s filmmaking techniques are identifiably of the moment — and his sensibility is as thoroughly French as the long, painstakingly prepared family meals that punctuate “Summer Hours” — the assurance and aesthetic poise of the film make it quietly ravishing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ifcfilms.com/viewFilm.htm?filmId=1537" target="_blank"&gt;Summer Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film, we'll attempt to get a table at &lt;b&gt;The Friendly Toast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: brown"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, opening today in Kendall Square (thanks to Tom Green for 'discovering' them setting up in place of the (twice) defunct chinese restaurant).  Those who've been to the &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Telluride By the Sea Film Festival&lt;/span&gt; in Portsmouth, New Hampshire are familiar with the original &lt;span style="color: brown"&gt;Friendly Toast&lt;/span&gt;, a family friendly restaurant.  Great food and a great place for a group discussion - provided there is space for us on a Saturday night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time approximate.  Specific start time to be posted later in the week.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be standing for hours in front of the theater as the Closing Credits roll</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242591582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Hours</name><id>10432308</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243120500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/10432308/</event_url></item>
