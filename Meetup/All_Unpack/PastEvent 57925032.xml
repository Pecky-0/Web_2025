&lt;p&gt;Enjoy great food, a unique martini list and a fabulous bartender! The downstairs lounge is a beautiful, intimate setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need at least 15 people for this event to run so I am posting a bit early. No shows will be no welcome at future events at this venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to stay the whole evening nor be there right at the start. Many of us arrive early and grab some dinner others come later for just one drink and some great chatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner Maria is kind enough to open this room up to us privately which is not usually open during the week, and we get the BEST BARTENDER IN THE WORLD Charlie Sheen's double but with an awesome personality Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to tip well as we get the room for free and a dedicated bartender.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337341814000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332783374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RETURN TO ARTICHOKES  Minimum 15 people</name><id>57925032</id><headcount>28</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337207400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/57925032/</event_url></item>
