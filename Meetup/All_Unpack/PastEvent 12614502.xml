And thank you so much, Caryn, for being such a wonderful host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We scheduled the next meetup for MONDAY, MARCH 22.  We didn't settle on a definitive meeting place because we wanted to see if anyone &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; would like to act as host.  If not, we've got a back up plan in place for meeting in Cape Elizabeth.  So, if you'd like to host the next meetup, please send me an email.  If not, we'll go to the back up plan and I'll send out the address, as usual, a couple of days in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and I look forward to seeing you next month,&lt;br /&gt;Kate&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate O'Neill</member_name><member_id>10631919</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271711202000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>MegaMagnets</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PLOAConnection</urlname><id>1426391</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Laws of Attraction Connection</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266289135000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Law of Attraction Connection</name><id>12614502</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269297000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PLOAConnection/events/12614502/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/b/global_13140939.jpeg</photo_url></item>
