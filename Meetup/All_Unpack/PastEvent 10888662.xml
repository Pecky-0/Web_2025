Plan on arriving early enough to unload.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start there and go up river. (to the left)  Plan on 3-4 hours on the river, maybe less, I am planning a slow leisurely paddle.  Going against the current as we start out and ride it slowly on the way back. Bring water and snack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayak safety gear is a must. Life jackets are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The river is a nice slow moving river however the ramp is steep. We will need to get one boat at a time into the water. Due to how steep the ramp is it can be a little tricky getting in and out of your kayak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting There . . .&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From Massachusetts Route 2, take Exit 38 (Route 110/111) south toward Harvard; bear right to stay on Route 110 at Harvard Center; and, turn right onto Still River Depot Road at the Still River Post Office. The refuge parking area is at the end of Still River Depot Road, past the railroad tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the road just ends at the railroad tracks but if you bear left down the dirt road then right the boat launch will be on your left. There is also a tarred parking lot on the right with restrooms. Please note, the last time I was out there, there was no sign for Still River Depot Road, there was a sign for the Oxbow National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan L</member_name><member_id>7773139</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248628740000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247737976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Early Morning on the Nashua River – 9:00 AM </name><id>10888662</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248008400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/10888662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
