The mission expanded as it catered to German and Irish immigrants who worked in the breweries along the Stony Brook and constructed the basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help.  You may have seen it in the news last year, as it was the location of Sen. Edward Kennedy's funeral mass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also see the remains of two Roxbury Puddingstone quarries, an architectural gem of a library designed by Ralph Adams Cram, the former home of Mayor Maurice J. Tobin, and a former tuberculosis sanatorium whose motto was &amp;quot;nothing over us but heaven.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walking tour winds up Mission Hill and ends at the top with sweeping views over Boston and the Boston Harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet outside the Roxbury Crossing T Station on the Orange Line. The tour is $15 for the general public and $5 for card-carrying BBF members and docents.
