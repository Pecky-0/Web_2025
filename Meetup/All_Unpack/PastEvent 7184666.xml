Instead of a feature speaker we will have two new discussion centered dialogs. They are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's Hot and What's Not&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;led by Tom Hill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom will lead a discussion on what trends - and associated stock tickers - are distinctly good for longs or shorts. The focus will be on ETFs and stocks for asset classes, sectors, industry groups and indexes. In particular, we will be looking to hear from you to find out what you have surmised and found a way to trade on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prospecting Using Investors.Com led by Jeff Orrik&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff will use Investors.com and the Premium package to prospect for stocks. The goal is to find stocks and ETFs at buy points while experimenting with the tools available on Investors.Com and using the various talents of everybody in the room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In addition we will continue with our regular features:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harlan's Market Update led by Harlan Rieur&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harlan gives us his live market analysis on market trends. Using StockCharts.com and his own combination of indicators - Bollinger Bands, stochastic RSI, MACD, Williams%, OBV plus his panoply of moving averages. Always a pleasure for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;StockPicks led by Chris Jones - New and Improved!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric announces which stocks performed best. Then we solicit all the picks from everyone and run through all them, with Jeff putting up the charts as we have done in the past. Afterwards we will focus on 5 of the  stocks to be analyzed by Sandy and dissected by the group at large. If any time remains, Chris will pick an industry or sector to brainstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Premeeting Period is the Daytraders Meeting led by Eric Eklof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Premeeting starts at 5:30 and runs until 6:50.
