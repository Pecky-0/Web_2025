&lt;p&gt;All current Meetup members are welcome to attend, and to invite people from outside the group as their guests. Please bring enough copies of your work to share with the group -- if you don't have access to printing, email your submissions to zakbos@gmail.com so that arrangements can be made to get copies for the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moderator for the Spring 2013 workshops will be Andrew Chenevert (Creative Writing, Lesley University).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359515487000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359405042000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BPU Weekly Writers Workshop</name><id>101832302</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359504000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/101832302/</event_url></item>
