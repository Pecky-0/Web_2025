And the campaigns start NOW.  All who wish to see Liberty grow in New Hampshire can help get pro-liberty candidates elected.  The NHLA is sponsoring a series of hands-on workshops to get candidates connected with activists, and to show new activists what they need to do to get their true representatives elected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first session is conveniently co-scheduled with Taproom Tuesday and will be led by Rep. Dan Itse. Come to learn, then hit the streets and campaign!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213919449000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213562010000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Election Activist Activation</name><id>8148111</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213746300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/8148111/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/1/global_4465489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
