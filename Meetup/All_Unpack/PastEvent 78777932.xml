MassArt Made, a retail venture featuring the art and design of alumni, students, faculty, and staff at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. &lt;br /&gt;

We are planning an event specifically for Personal Stylists, in order to introduce ourselves as a resource for you. Our best selling items are jewelry and accessories, and we're hoping to have a broader fashion selection in the fall, as the college is hosting a Zandra Rhodes exhibit in our galleries. We want stylists to think of us as a place to find cutting edge fashion, jewelry, and accessories, and tomorrow's trends. &lt;br /&gt;

The event will be completely free; light refreshments will be served, and parking will be provided. It will be held at MassArt Made, after hours. You'll be able to meet some of the artists and designers, and learn about commissioning works.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorrie Pearson</member_name><member_id>2115352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346290509000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>beauty, fashion, photo stylists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-beauty-fashion-and-photo-stylist</urlname><id>1460783</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Beauty, Fashion and Photo Stylist</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345594081000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Event for stylists at MassArt Made</name><id>78777932</id><headcount>4</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346194800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-beauty-fashion-and-photo-stylist/events/78777932/</event_url></item>
