&lt;p&gt;Many of you have met our wonderful permaculture group members &lt;a href="http://livingwithgoats.com/wordpress/?page_id=4"&gt;Karl Schatz and Margaret Hathaway of Ten Apple Farm&lt;/a&gt; on Route 115 in Gray.  They have generously shared their learning over the years and brought fabulous milk and cheeses to our monthly swaps.  They have been very active in the local Slow Food chapter over the years.  You may also have met their three lovely little girls, the youngest of which was just born a few months ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret has been in and out of the emergency room this week with the sudden onset of Lyme Disease... and with three little ones and a farm full of animals, this call for help is being put out for Sunday morning!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a little bit of time Sunday morning and the ability to get to Ten Apple Farm for a little while?  Karl mentioned that they have a good supply of milk, eggs, cheese to share.  There is also goat manure (some composted) for your garden if you bring some empty buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show up any time after 9am.  Wear/bring work clothes/gloves/footwear and a dish to share for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's more info from Karl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Margaret was diagnosed with Lyme Disease tuesday night at the ER after a week of high fevers, terrible muscle and head pain and nausea. She's finally on the right medication, and in much better shape than she was 4 days ago, but is still suffering unbearable headaches and is also suffering from Bell's Palsy, paralysis of the left side of her face. She's doing her best to rest and try to beat this thing and get back on her feet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...the big project is trying to get the barn cellar set up and ready for our six baby goats that are in a temporary pen in the barn that they are quickly outgrowing. To do this, we need to move a big pile of goat manure/bedding that was shoveled out from up above last year, move a lot of old rotten lumber, and generally clean up under the barn. There's also a goat pen that really needs to get mucked out, and also weeding in the garden. I would say those are the 3 big things: cleaning out barn cellar (and possibly building a pen out of wood pallets), pen mucking, weeding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People are welcome to bring buckets or other containers to take goat manure/ goat bedding home to their compost piles. We have a lot that's already composted and ready to put right on the garden, and a lot that needs further composting. We also have eggs, milk and cheese that people can take home."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
