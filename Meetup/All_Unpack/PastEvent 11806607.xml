It's basically a social event that includes reading a book and getting together once a month (at a pub/restaurant) to discuss the book, while having some beer and grabbing a bite. I have started a discussion to get some feed back as to what book people might want to read, and to know what people thought about the timing. It looks like the book is &lt;b&gt;The Evolution of God by Robert Wright&lt;/b&gt;. I will have loaner copies of the book, if you need one please email me. This Book &amp;amp; Brew meet-up, which I hope to offer once a month, is aimed at sharing, good, scientific literature, philosophical literature, inspiring stories, and the occasional piece of fiction. I will post more information as I get more feed back. This will most likely be held somewhere near Government Center, for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There will be a table reserved for BA..</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>20</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260835528000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257461515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book &amp; Brew (The Evolution of God by Robert Wright)</name><id>11806607</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260662400000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/11806607/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
