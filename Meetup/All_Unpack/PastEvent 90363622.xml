&lt;p&gt;Hop aboard the CT REIA bus... so that we can take you out looking at some of our incredible AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE investment properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This bus tour will be an educational property viewing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All properties we tour will include a detailed summary sheet of the subject property with the current purchase price, total renovations, so that you can project your profit. With our diligence package you can determine your investment basis, selling price and total profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This tour will be very educational AND provide you the opportunity to purchase properties!&lt;/strong&gt; You will have an opportunity to meet with the best in our business and network with others like-minded. Our moderators will offer their expertise on over 30 properties in the buying and rental sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will learn how to develop and continue to improve your real estate investment team while touring potential investment opportunities.&lt;/strong&gt; You will learn which pitfalls to avoid and how to take advantage of those that other investors avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the properties, we will do a thorough walk through to identify the required repairs. You will learn to analyze a rehab to prevent over spending or, more importantly, prevent from missing out on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can hardly remember the times when it was this much fun to buy property!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you expect to pay to gain access to information that has taken years of research to compile? What would you expect to pay for strategies that will ensure that you build financial stability safely and securely for your family? $100, $200, $1,000?&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Baumgarten</member_name><member_id>6320255</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354407009000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Real Estate Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctreia</urlname><id>989128</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>CT REIA - The Connecticut Real Estate Investors Assn.
