You should come to the 2nd floor conference room. There is also parking available at a cheap evening rate in the building.  Parking is also free on the street in front of the building at 6 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 6:30 PM Dmitriy Dunin will discuss interacting with the DOM in JavaScript.  The DOM is an inconvenient and messy API whose exposure and behavior can change in unexpected and unintuitive ways. This presentation will provide an overview of the DOM and what to expect when using different browsers and browser profiles (e.g. quirks v. standards mode) while providing suggestions on how to avoid unexpected DOM behavior and unnecessary headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any JavaScript-related issues members are facing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft will provide pizza again. What a nice company! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and bring guests. Last time we ran out of pizza so we want an accurate head count.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to the 2nd Floor Conference Center.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marsh Sutherland</member_name><member_id>3795141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251414035000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>JavaScripters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>javascript-2</urlname><id>884541</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>The Boston JavaScript Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>43</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246372994000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Interacting with the DOM in JavaScript</name><id>10769074</id><headcount>43</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248991200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/javascript-2/events/10769074/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/f/global_2825455.jpeg</photo_url></item>
