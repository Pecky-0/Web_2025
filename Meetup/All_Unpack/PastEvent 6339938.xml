<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Agile Scrum is one of the fastest-growing Agile methodologis used to rapidly develop products in shorter time and that meets the ever changing needs of todays business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was formalized over a decade ago by Ken Schwaber and Dr. Jeff Sutherland, and it's now being used by companies large and small, including Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, Lockheed Martin, Motorola, SAP, Cisco, GE Medical, CapitalOne and the US Federal Reserve. Many teams using Scrum report significant improvements, and in some cases complete transformations, in both productivity and morale. For product developers - many of whom have been burned by the &amp;quot;management fad of the month club&amp;quot; - this is significant. Scrum is simple, powerful, and rooted in common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join BostonPHP and Michael Bourque as he presents the concept of Scrum and shows why so many people are now deploying scrum to their development projects. Michael will take us through the process and talk about how his company, Parametric Technology Inc. (PTC) , is successfully applying Scrum. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191623548000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189553829000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October User Group:: What is Agile Scrum?</name><id>6339938</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191450600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/6339938/</event_url></item>
