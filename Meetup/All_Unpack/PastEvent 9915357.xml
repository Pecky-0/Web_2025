The Sunday matinees in partnership with the Goethe-Institut Boston showcase a sampling of new and award-winning German films rarely shown outside Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Lumber Kings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lovely and charismatic loser Krischan (Bjarne MÃ¤del) comes back after 12 years to his working class village Tanne in the Harz mountains, planning to hold a lumber jack competition there. He manages not only to overcome the massive resistance of his old friends Ronnie (Frank Auerbach) and Bert (Steven Merting), who had to pay off a huge debt after Krischan left, but also transforms the whole economically depressed village, saving it from a state of stagnancy and resignation. (comedy, 2006, Germany) dir. Matthias Keilich, DVD, 94 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll go to an area restaurant for lunch and discussion of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the movie I'll stand near the theater exit holding a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236617375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Koenige der Nutzholzgewinnung (Lumber Kings)</name><id>9915357</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237734000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9915357/</event_url></item>
