Please bring (or email me) a list of books you would like to read at future meetups.  First meetup will be held at French Press (near BC) - T- accessible on the B line- last stop literally drops you off at the front door of the coffee shop.  Come enjoy your favorite beverage and/or afternoon snack with new friends discussing one of your favorite things-BOOKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 12/3: French Press is a nice but small cafe- I will arrive early to try to reserve us a spot.  However, if there is no room or if you arrive past 3pm and can't find us please walk up the street (two or three shops up from the T-towards Newton) and find us at another shop White Mountain Creamery.  Thanks- Looking forward to meeting you and having a great discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sabina</member_name><member_id>1638720</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165953814000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163646776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December gathering</name><id>5271100</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165780800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/5271100/</event_url></item>
