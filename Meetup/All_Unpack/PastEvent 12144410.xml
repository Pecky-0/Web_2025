LOOK FOR THE PHOTOS OF THIS GREAT ADVENTURE WHEN WE RETURN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each year the &lt;b&gt;Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC)&lt;/b&gt; has a camping/hiking trip called &lt;b&gt;August Camp&lt;/b&gt;.  This years destination is Banff Alberta.  Last year I went on this trip in Oregon and had an amazing time.  I am sending out this information as an FYI.  If you have more interest, go to &lt;a href="http://www.augustcamp.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.augustcamp...&lt;/a&gt;  for all the details.  I am planning on attending this year.  The folks going and I are looking at week four August 7-August 14.  I am not acting as a trip coordinator.  All reservations and payments are on you. If you would like to attend let me know and I can give you information and know that we are headed out the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is information from their home page from the event:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base camp is at Beaverfoot Lodge campground in the Beaverfoot Valley surrounded by stunning mountain scenery. Our location is between Field and Golden, British Columbia and is bordered by Yoho National Park to the north and Kootenay National Park to the south. Our activities will take us to Yoho, Banff, Kootenay, Glacier and Jasper National Parks with their snowcapped mountains, vast glaciers and ice fields, turquoise lakes, thundering waterfalls, wildflowers, hot springs and fossil beds.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;August Camp offers several hikes each day for all levels of ability. Car camping and backpacking excursions, river rafting, canoeing and kayaking are also planned. Delicious cooked meals and trail lunches are provided; great camaraderie and nightly campfires make for a memorable experience.
