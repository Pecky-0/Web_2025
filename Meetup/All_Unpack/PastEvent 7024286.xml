Based on Jimmy Murphy's play, The Kings of the Kilburn High Road, and starring Colm Meaney, Kings is Ireland's nominee for an Oscar this year in the Best Foreign Language Film category. A universal story of a search for identity, Kings tells of six young men who leave their homes in the west of Ireland in the 1970s, to sail to England in hope of making their fortunes and returning home. Thirty years later only one, Jackie Flavin, returns-in a coffin. Jackie's five friends reunite at his wake where they face the reality of their years of alienation and disconnection. Tom Collins's long-awaited, tender film speaks directly to the dispossessed and disenfranchised with nowhere to call home, and shows us that &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; is always closer than we think. In English and Gaelic with English subtitles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MFA members, seniors, and students $8; general admission $9.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will hold up a sign near the front and off to one side while the credits are rolling.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>3369401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949394000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><why>We'll have fun discussing the movie afterwards at a local restaurant.</why><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199400442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Kings" at the MFA</name><id>7024286</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200164400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7024286/</event_url></item>
