I am scheduling these events as 2 separate meetups.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who would like a day at the beach?  We will meetup @ 11:30am on the oceanside directly across from &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; St. and La Bec Rouge Bar &amp;amp; Restaurant. The beach is less congested at this end. I will be standing by the railing on the sidewalk directly over the sandy beach. To those who RSVP a &amp;quot;solid&amp;quot; yes, I will email you my cell #.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, pack your coolers, towels, chair. Don't forget your beach toys! Let's have a fun day. There are meters , some on street parking ( I think?) and plenty of lots off Ocean Blvd. If you are interested in carpooling? Don't just add it to your RSVP.. Contact a member directly via their profile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;* NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;Obviously this event is weather permitting! Please check for a cancellation  message if there is any chance of rain before heading out.This event has been cross posted with other meetup groups.*** We wait 10 minutes for &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs. We do not wait for &amp;quot;maybes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Oceanside directly across from "L" St. &amp; La Bec Rouge (73 Ocean Blvd)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215358552000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214791251000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A  Day @ The Beach - Hampton Beach NH</name><id>8243087</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215185400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/8243087/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/4/global_4630516.jpeg</photo_url></item>
