I spoke to my soccer team and they are open to having pics taken with the caveat that no really bad tragic photos be posted to the web. A copy of all (final) photos taken will be given to me which I will post to our teams TeamSnap website for players to capture the pics they want for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in doing some sports photography with a group of athletic and intense co-ed players. Come out next Saturday. (I was so bummed to not have a camera today. There were some serious physical action shots?.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as to not overwhelm the team I'm going to limit this to 8 NEPN photographers. PLEASE only RSVP if you are 100% you will make it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have 4 more games so if you can't make this one I will post another game after we see how this shoot goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email or call me with questions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Eileen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are in Light Purple (Violet) shirts playing against a team in Light Pink.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214239251000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213502248000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sat, Jun 21, 2008 12:40 PM - 1:50 PM</name><id>8145184</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214065800000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8145184/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/a/global_4457834.jpeg</photo_url></item>
