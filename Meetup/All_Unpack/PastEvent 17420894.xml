Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. would like to help you achieve your potential. Writing a great resume does not mean you need to follow all of the rules you&amp;rsquo;ve read about resume writing. Your resume does not have to be one page or follow a specific resume format. Every resume is a one-of-a-kind marketing communication. It should be tailored to your needs and the positions you are applying for. We invite you to attend our morning program called Best Practices on Writing a Resume. For the first hour, two Vertex Staffing Professionals will share a few practices they feel are best for developing a highly effective resume. After a brief Q&amp;amp;A, we will break off into smaller groups for one - on - one resume review and discussion. Please note this is NOT a recruiting event. The purpose of this exercise is to reach out to our community so you can reach your career potential. Please RSVP to Tracy_Chandler@vrtx.com no later than April 29th. Seating is limited to 50 participants.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cost:&lt;/span&gt; Free&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304823948000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303705804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Career Invigoration: Best Practices on Writing a Technical Resume</name><id>17420894</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304686800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/17420894/</event_url></item>
