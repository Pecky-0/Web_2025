Take note guys - we're on the road so potholes are simply a fact of life here in New England. Road conditions are mixed but we'll be riding on Sunday afternoon so hopefully reduced traffic on the roads. There are several major road crossings (Route 106, under 495 twice, etc.) so you'll need to feel relatively comfortable around motor vehicles and moving quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a shorter, 15-mile route that will start the same but cut out the Easton/Norton portion by turning right before 106 and finishing the loop back to Shaw's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the ride we can go to: &lt;a href="http://www.mandarintaste.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Alice's Mandarin Taste&lt;/a&gt; (fine szechuan and mandarin cuisines -- &lt;i&gt;or so the website says&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the bikes - we'll park close to Main Street, furtherest from the shops near the entrance of the parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bethany</member_name><member_id>10111481</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255198175000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252510884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Keepin' It Local..30 miler!</name><id>11328244</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253469600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/11328244/</event_url></item>
