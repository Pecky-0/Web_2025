With that in mind, we have a friendly competition for the meet-ups that meet here at DoggieDay.  This month we are asking that you bring at least one item from the 'Wishlist' on the Boston MSPCA Animal Care and Adoption Website.  This list includes blankets, towels, grocery store gift cards (fruits and veggies), office supply gift cards, dog and cat toys, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winning meet-up group to provide the most for the MSCPA will win a New Year's Party here at DoggieDay.  This will attract press and exposur efor the MSPCA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165350035000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>43</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162656381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Pug December Meetup</name><id>5243823</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165071600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/5243823/</event_url></item>
