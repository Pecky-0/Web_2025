I find having a plan and working it is the only way to see permanent results and I want to talk about &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot; keeping as well.  Without a journal you can't see your progress clearly.  When incremental changes in your health take place it's hard to see the progress without looking back from where you came.  By sharing our information through recovery we should be able to work on individualized plans to take you to the next level of health and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to take some time to talk about supplements and what is working for each and every one of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the meeting, and remember donations are greatly accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248823419000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242173021000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia June Meetup</name><id>10398064</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244588400000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/10398064/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
