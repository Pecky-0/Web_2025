We're making up for it this month with several wonderful opportunities for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;It's easy to be happy when &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; are going well; but how do you stay in your happy zone and vibrate high at other times?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we'll be discussing and learning &amp;quot;How can I be happy when....?&amp;quot;  First we'll discuss as a group together.  Then we'll get in smaller groups or pairs to work through and practice your own specific examples.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Hoping we'll have time for a nice, little guided meditation, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're sure to leave feeling &amp;quot;good, good, good, good vibrations&amp;quot;! (Beach Boys song)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to RSVP, and after you do so,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; let us know if your plans change, so we wonâ€™t be waiting for you unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Check out our calendar for details on our community cookout on Sat. the 22nd, too!  We've even got fun entertainment with a mentalist lined up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Lastly, remember to set your preferences to receive our e-mails and be able to participate in message board discussions.  (Go to your Account.  Then on the Membership and Communication link.  Then under our meetup, click on edit e-mail settings.)  Let's amp up the value we can gain by sharing more information and tips, etc. and building a greater sense of community and connection.  Connected people are happier people!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun.  Please join us!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to back of front lobby, near water cooler and go upstairs.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6516126</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274302821000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270564576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"How can I be happy when...?"</name><id>lqmdnynhbxb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274223600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/13102277/</event_url></item>
