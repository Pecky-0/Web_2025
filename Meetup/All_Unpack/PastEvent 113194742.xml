&lt;p&gt;At a recent meetup participants had shared that this has happened to them. Has this happened to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt;You're not consistently attracting more of what you want in life &amp;amp; you don't have any ideas of what the real issue is or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt;you know what the issue is, but not sure what to do to resolve it (even though you thought you did) or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; you are triggered by an experience, &amp;amp; suddenly what you thought you've made peace with or overcame is right there, smack in your face again. You feel you are back to where you were, down the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you start judging yourself. "Unattractive" feelings come up again, like "I'm not deserving, I'm not worthy." You might even get panicky, scared &amp;amp; distressed again, feeling a loss of control, wondering whether this will ever end or get resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does this happen &amp;amp; how do you finally put these “unattractive” dissonant feelings &amp;amp; behaviors &amp;amp; root issues to rest? (And you know this is important since this can keep you from attracting more of what you desire.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuliya Cohen, energy healer, has a surprising explanation. You, in fact, might not at fault for these persistent yucky feelings or behavior patterns. That's why all the personal self development “work” you've done might not have worked. You keep blaming yourself for something that is not you and is not yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuliya has been amazingly successful in helping folks discover the root issues easily &amp;amp; energetically in a safe, easy &amp;amp; lasting way, so that they could be whole again. You can become a vibrational attraction magnet again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us this Tuesday at a joint meetup with the Boston Law of Attraction group where Yuliya will share with us this eye-opening 4-step exercise based on her innovative Energy Restructuring system that allows us to "unblend" from old "unattractive patterns." She will also discuss how the new generation of therapies, such as Internal Family System, are using similar approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be learn how... by using Energy Psychology principles of “energetic boundaries” to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- identify the unattractive distressed feelings &amp;amp; behaviors &amp;amp; then separate yourself from them very quickly (so that you can shift into a more “neutral” vibrational place to deal with what's really going on)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- dialog safely with these feelings &amp;amp; behaviors to identify the source of the trauma. You'll be very surprised who is at fault! These deeply entreated emotions could have come from other people in your present life, as early as in the womb. Or These could also be inherited burdens from an ancestor in your family tree among other sources. (Keep an open mind!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- disengage from the root source of the trauma that's not caused by you ( so that they no longer "energetically cling” to you) &amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- most importantly, recover the lost energy of your true essence, your attractiveness. Feel again that you are worthy, no more self judgment, fully healed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we move deeper into Spring time, discover how motivating, powerful &amp;amp; energizing this practice is as you become fully re-integrated &amp;amp; aligned with your wholeness, and even reset your genetic code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
