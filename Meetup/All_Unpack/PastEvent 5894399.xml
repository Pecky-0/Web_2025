<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>At our next meeting we will address the 5th set of objections (by Pierre Gassendi) and replies (from pp 179 through pp 278). This is a long reading for two weeks, let's try to cover as much as we can. I believe that many of us prefer not to finish the rest of the objections and replies and move on. So after the next meeting we probably will tackle other works of Descartes then that of other philosophers. (Let me try to recall the tentative plan: Spinoza, Hobbes, maybe Leibniz, Locke, Hume then possibly Kant, Hegel....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an article about Gassendi in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/" target="_blank"&gt;http://plato.stanford...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183244735000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181904948000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Descartes: Mediations; 5th set of objections and replies</name><id>5894399</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183071600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5894399/</event_url></item>
