I began moderating for Aaron Wall over at SeoBook.Com last year. Being asked to moderate on a forum that is owned by one of the top marketers in the game was quite humbling. In additional to running my own web properties I do private consulting on anything and everything related to B2C marketing (web and print) and I've worked with a couple of the largest insurance carriers in the US on their SEO, social media, and PPC marketing efforts.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:15: Additional Q &amp;amp; A, What's Working, &amp;amp; Challenge Questions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:45pm The End &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you all at this informal Boston search engine round table discussion!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cambridge SEO MeetUp   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------   &lt;br /&gt;Guest Speaker's Wanted:    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've been working hard to find industry experts and to develop a formal agenda to keep it interesting for all those that attend at this new big meeting room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food Event Sponsors:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEO Pro's, will work for food!
