Eaton has transcribed and studied a document in the collection of the MHA, the 1759 account book kept by Captain John Stark of Derryfield. Stark would go on to fame as a general in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. He was effectively second in command of the famous Rogers Rangers, an irregular unit of the British Army during the French and Indian War. His account book reveals a great deal about the life of the soldier during this era. Pre-registration is recommended.
