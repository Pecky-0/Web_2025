It will be a nice way to do some adventure before the winter sports season start.  The offer various sizes for Canoes and Kayaks at the Kendall location by Charles River.  Look at the link below to see the rates and location for Kendall.  They also have relatively cheap parking which will need to be validated, so make sure to bring your sticker.  The rental rates range on the size of boats we rent from $16 to $24 per hour per boat.  Canoe which fits 4-5 people is around $24/hr.  So overall it could be less than $10 per person per hour.  So a relatively cheap activity and lot of fun.  We plan to meet by the location by 2:45.  Make sure you have couple of layers as it might be bit cool on the water although forecast is showing it to be a high of mid 60s and sunny, so that is nice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paddleboston.com/kendall/rates.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.paddlebost...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paddleboston.com/kendall/directions.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.paddlebost...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there, &lt;br /&gt;Vishal&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Vishal</member_name><member_id>10102488</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254668918000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253667863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>On Charles River Canoe and Kayak </name><id>11442221</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253991600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11442221/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
