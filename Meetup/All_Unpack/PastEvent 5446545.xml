<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will continue with Thomas More's Utopia  (Dover Publications ISBN: 0486295834, 85 pages). It is not easy to read the material for the meetings twice a month. To help the situation we will try to nail down the text two meetings ahead. The following meeting (March 1st) will be on Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis (Dover Publications ISBN:  0486430820 , 40 pages). I also would like to ask us to think about and act on the suggestion of one our members form the last meeting. Many of us read these works the first time. Even if we limit the texts (or the part of the text)  to be read each time between 50 and 100 pages it is not easy to focus. To help the discussion we should pick a part of the reading  (lines, paragraph,chapter...) that we found for one reason or an other interesting or captivating. We should re-read that part or just think about it in more detail and bring that up at the meeting. Not that the meetings do not seem lively enough anyways, however I think that this practice would help all of us to focus and to better understand the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171757063000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170423594000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thomas More: Utopia</name><id>5446545</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171584000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5446545/</event_url></item>
