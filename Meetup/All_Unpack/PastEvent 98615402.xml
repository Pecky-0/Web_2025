Let's meet in front of Whole Foods then walk over to the pond and around the the 2.25 mile paved trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh Pond is a reservoir and park in Cambridge. Its grounds were designed in 1897 by the renowned Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Fresh Pond is a favorite place for many people who enjoy walking, running, bike riding, and roller-blading on the 2¼ mile perimeter road. Birders come to observe a wide variety of resident birds, as well as numerous migrating songbirds and waterfowl that pass through every year. Artists, naturalists and students also treasure this green oasis in its urban setting.&lt;/p&gt;
