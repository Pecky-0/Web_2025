From sorrow to laughter, banishment to marriage, the play involves conversations about life and love, and a clash of views, with a hilarious mixture of romantic and slapstick comedy. A play of passion, romance, and disguise, the game of love is tried until identities are revealed and all is resolved.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2nd is also the 3rd annual Celebrate Shakespeare Day, also at the Parkman Bandstand. &amp;quot;Celebrate Shakespeare Day is a multi-faceted free event featuring workshops, performances, backstage tours, and lectures for the public to enjoy and learn more about the works of William Shakespeare.&amp;quot;  Celebrate Shakespeare Day goes from 2:00 to 6:00 pm.  I thought we could meet around 4:00 pm for the workshops and other things they have going on and then stay for the production which starts at 8:00 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be in front of the Parkman Bandstand at 4:00.  We can meet there and then find a place to picnic and see the production.  Bring blankets, chairs, umbrella (in case of rain), snacks and drinks (I don't think alcohol is allowed at the Commons).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in front of Parkman Bandstand.
