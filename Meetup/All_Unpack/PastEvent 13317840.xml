This coming Friday at 7:00pm I am offering an Intro BELAY Class for all those who need to learn.  Starts at 7, should be done at about 9, depending on the number of people. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Here's the deal with cost:   As some of you may know, the gym is currently running a membership special which works in 2 ways.  For $99 dollars you can either get a 3 month membership which includes gear, or a 4 month membership without gear.  Follow me?   This promotion ends on Friday, which is part of the reason why i'm running this class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;This meetup will cost $120 - you will get the Belay Class (normally $55 per person) plus the option of tacking on one of these membership specials.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are at least remotely interested in this sport I would highly suggest taking advantage of this deal.  Think about the costs - a normal visit to the rock costs $14 for a day pass, then $7 gear rental.  $21.   If you came twice a month over the summer under either one of these membership plans, it would pay for itself quickly, and then some.   IT'S A SUPER GOOD DEAL, AND NOT TO BE MISSED!!!!  Plus, you'll learn to belay which is essentially the first step. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anyway, please let me know if you have any questions.  When you RSVP, please also call the gym at 203-404-5166 to reserve your spot.  Also, if you decide to do this please arrive 15 min. beforehand to fill out waivers and get set with gear.  Clothing is something comfortable that you'd wear to the gym. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cheers,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Dan &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Rock-Climbing-Meetup/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note:  This special is not available to current EFT members.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check in at the Front Desk</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Jeanette</member_name><member_id>8934370</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kat</member_name><member_id>11236133</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272840537000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctrockclimbing</urlname><id>1388805</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>CT Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272466967000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beginner Belay Class + Membership Special!!! - A Super Deal - Check it Out!!!</name><id>13317840</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272667500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ctrockclimbing/events/13317840/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/5/global_7662965.jpeg</photo_url></item>
