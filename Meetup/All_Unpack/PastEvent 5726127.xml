The boat will cost $12 and leaves at 10 sharp, so get there early to find the ticket office and the wharf. We will arrive at Spectacle Island 10 minutes later, spend 2 hours there, then catch the 12:15 ferry to Georges Island.  We will catch the 2:30 ferry back to Boston arriving 2:55. Facilities are limited on Georges, so bring water. Bring a lunch or get a sandwich at the Spectacle Island snack bar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harbor Express and Harbor Islands Express vessels depart from the north side of Long Wharf, adjacent the Marriott hotel and the Christopher Columbus Park. Walk north on Atlantic Avenue from the parking garages past the Aquarium. Take a right once you pass the Marriott. Our ticket kiosk is 100 yards down on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonislands.org/isle_profiles.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonisla...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georges Island &lt;br /&gt;At the time of Euro-American colonization, Georges Island was comprised of two drumlins, rising out of the bay like other nearby islands. The island was used for agricultural for two hundred years until 1825 when the U.S. Government acquired the island for coastal defense.&lt;br /&gt;Over the next twenty years the island was dramatically altered and one of the country's finest forts was built. Dedicated in 1847, Fort Warren's defensive design was virtually obsolete upon completion. However the fort served as a training ground, patrol point, and Civil War prison that gained a favorable reputation for the humane treatment of its Confederate prisoners. After one hundred years of military use the fort was decommissioned in 1947 and acquired by the Metropolitan District Commission for historic preservation and recreation in 1958.&lt;br /&gt;To this day, within the fort's dark corridors, the legend lives on of &amp;quot;The Lady in Black,&amp;quot; the ghost of a Confederate prisoner's wife who is said to have been sentenced to death for aiding in an escape and hanged in a black robe made from the Fort's mess hall drapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spectacle Island&lt;br /&gt;Spectacle Island (105 acres) features a marina, visitor center, cafe, two sandy beaches, and five miles of walking trails that lead to the crest of a 157 foot-high hill, offering panoramic views of the harbor and the city. Supervised swimming is offered daily.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181055582000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177967072000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Harbor Islands</name><id>5726127</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180878300000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5726127/</event_url></item>
