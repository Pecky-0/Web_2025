Breakfast includes pancakes, eggs, sausage, hash browns, fruit, muffins, bagels, juice, coffee and more. Tickets will be given to you that morning, so be on time so we don't have wait on you to eat. After breakfast we ask that you stay and help with preparing mailers for sponsorships and donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

There is also usually a bake sale going on if you want to bring some money to pick up something yummy! I'm sure they would appreciate the added support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet up that morning</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Petrillo</member_name><member_id>8764866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365351161000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362695894000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wapping Fair Work Party breakfast</name><id>108161482</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>9000000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365341400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/108161482/</event_url></item>
