As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight. What she can only understand as a cautionary miracle, sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
