Wimp Volleyball on a sand court is a noncompetitive game. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be following the rules and keeping score. Having fun and learning will be more important than winning. We work on trying to keeping the volley going, rather than trying to end the volley. So, bring your friends and teens, your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and insect repellent.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Don’t want to play but want to spend the day cheering us on?   Just bring a lawn chair and join us on the sideline.    I hope to see you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will be bringing ladder golf and I have two badmitton rackets.  If you have other yard games, please feel free to bring those too and you my want to bring a chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can bring charcoal and lighter fluid.  Bring your own burger/dogs to cook and something to share.  If you want to state what you are bringing to share that might be helpful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If&lt;/span&gt; anyone has a better venue in mind where there is a volleyball net, please feel free to send me a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
