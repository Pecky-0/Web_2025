Use the time to finish up any gifts or cards you're making, work on your ATCs for swaps in 2011, or on anything else you want. We always have fun at these smaller Meetups. Sign up now to join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY/TIME: Sunday, December 19, from 1 pm to ???? (Really, we'll stay as late as anybody wants to stay!) Come for an hour or two; come for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AGENDA: No scheduled activities. Arrive and leave when you want. Work on your own projects at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that you keep your RSVP up to date so we know who's coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMENITIES: Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: $10 to help defray the Studio rental costs. (ArtStudio 360 renters attend free.)&lt;br /&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP: These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting list. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function. Please RSVP for your guests as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event. See the end of this message for an important update about RSVPs for Open Studios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO BRING: Your own materials and projects to work on (just as you do for the regular Meetup). But basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use. Even if you show up empty-handed, we can get you started on projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANCELLATIONS: In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot; So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292867587000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291437883000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Studio at ArtStudio 360 in Holliston, Sunday, December 19th </name><id>15637753</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292781600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/15637753/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/b/global_19441659.jpeg</photo_url></item>
