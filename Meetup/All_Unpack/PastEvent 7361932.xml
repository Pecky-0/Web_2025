The film is about so much more, the less you know the better. The reason I like it is because Fight Club defines an entire generation (the X'ers) to some degree. Although I am not a part of that generation, I understand the part about the spiritual depression. It's a poignant and moving statement for the current state of affairs for the young people in any generation.

Notes: Please do not RSVP YES if you do not intend to come. Yes is not a MAYBE. If you can't figure out what you are going to do in the future, please do not burden us with that. Please buy your tix AHEAD of time! I'm going to watch this regardless of people coming, but it will more fun with people.

I will be there with friends probably before 11:30PM sometime. I intend to go into the auditorium by 11:45PM SHARP with spaces reserved. So the earlier you come, the more likely you can get a good seat. If you don't show up, I won't be reserving a seat for you. The film begins @midnight.</description><how_to_find_us>I"ll be wearing my trademark green hat+Meetup logo+my screename JediFonger in front as usual @the TOP of the stairs AFTER you buy your ticket!
