&lt;p&gt;SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues. We create social spaces that allow for the possibility of cross-issue connections and run a Skillshare Series, hosted by The NonProfit Center*, which increases our individual capacity for movement building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very excited that Robbie Samuels, co-founder of Socializing for Justice and &lt;em&gt;Art of the Schmooze&lt;/em&gt; trainer, is returning to facilitate this training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraising: Getting Past the Fear of Asking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This engaging coaching session focuses on getting past the fear of asking and how to avoid some common mistakes. Learn an easy way to sort through contact lists and build a strong prospect list based on the 3 Cs of fundraising: capacity, connection and commitment. Learn specific language for how to make a strong ask, based on the relationship-building tips shared in &lt;em&gt;Art of the Schmooze&lt;/em&gt;, and ten tips that will make your next fundraising plan a success. "If you are afraid to ask for money, kick yourself out of the way and let the cause talk."&lt;/p&gt;
