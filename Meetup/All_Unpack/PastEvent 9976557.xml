By sharing we should be able to work on individualized plans for recovery to take you to the next level of health and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs to have an individualized plan that they work on every day so let's get that done at the next meeting.  It doesn't have to be complicated, just 1 or 2 new products or plans of action to follow through on each and every day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to introduce you to my newest favorite Fibro book.  For me it's the best book to be published in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(I will be bringing in a new topical product for pain with Alpha Lipoic Acid in it.  It is for nerve related pain and has been used for diabetic neuropathy. Recently the company that sells it, Massada, got feedback about its value for Fibro pain.  I want everyone to apply some as soon as they get in the room.  The company says it works within 30-45 minutes.  I want your feedback on its' performance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the meeting, and remember donations are greatly accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244590575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237334988000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia May Meetup</name><id>9976557</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242169200000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/9976557/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
