This is due to the Memorial Day Holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be our final meetup until September, so please do try to make it if possible! We will be meeting at the usual place: the Trident Cafe on Newbury Street in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will bring a Meetup sign similar to the ones you see on the site. Feel free to bring friends and other designers you think will be interested. Also please note that we will be asking for donations to defray the cost of our Meetup group (about $10 per month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to bring business cards and extra money for food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273539736000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Graphic Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>graphicdesign-39</urlname><id>71144</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Graphic Design Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1115253375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Graphic Design June Meetup</name><id>4687645</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1118273400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/graphicdesign-39/events/4687645/</event_url></item>
