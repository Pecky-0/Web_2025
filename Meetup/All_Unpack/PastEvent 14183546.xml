She lived in Roman Egypt, and was killed by a Christian mob who falsely blamed her for religious turmoil.Some suggest that her murder marked the end of what is traditionally known as Classical antiquity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A helpful review appears at &lt;a href="http://www.weeklydig.com/arts-entertainment/movies/201007/agora" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.weeklydig....&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be ready to grab drinks afterward, as the group decides.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280710180000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279830462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Screening: AGORA</name><id>14183546</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280705400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/14183546/</event_url></item>
