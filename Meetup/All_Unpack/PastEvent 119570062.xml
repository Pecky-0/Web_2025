<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Lets earn some good elevation gain and get a good workout for our legs on Sunday morning. For all those of us who have obligations later in the day and can't head to the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we will do: &lt;br /&gt;

 Use the steps and seats of the 37 sections of the stadium to run/walk up and down, and up and down, and up and down,... One tour (heading up and down all 37 sections once) adds to approx. 1.2mi, approx. 40% uphill, 40% downhill, 20% flat as you walk from section to section, as measured by another runner. Good timesÂ &lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/981263258369601089/img/smileys/smile.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody can go at his/her own pace to get a great workout, and we can cheer each other on across the sections. Every time I have been there many locals were working out; it is a great atmosphere as strangers root for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-street parking as well as free parking right at the stadium (as you drive in through the gates around the stadium). Only one entrance into the stadium is open --&amp;gt; you have to walk up some stairs and you arrive in section 1. We will meet right there in Section 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be starting my workout at 7:30am sharp. I will be there approx. 10minutes early to 'meet and greet' all of you. Should you be arriving past 7:30am, yell my name, and I will 'wave' from another section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to complete 2 full sections, mixing using the seats and steps 50/50. I hope to complete this in less than 1.5hours without break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to bring: &lt;br /&gt;

 -something to drink &lt;br /&gt;

 -possibly dress in layers (weather dependent) &lt;br /&gt;

 -possibly a sweat towel &lt;br /&gt;

 I am not sure whether an evening event will occur on Saturday evening. If so, then the Stadium will be cleaned that morning and you canNOT leave your water bottle and/or jacket in one section; then you will need to carry your belongings with you. (Last weekend the cleaning crew was busy cleaning after a football game; they are awesome guys, stepping out of your way as you are running up and down, respecting our workouts in their workspace; but they will clean EVERYTHING; it was the only time a cleaning crew was in the Stadium thus far when I was there, so I say the odds are low; when they are not, you can leave your belongings in one place.)&lt;/p&gt;
