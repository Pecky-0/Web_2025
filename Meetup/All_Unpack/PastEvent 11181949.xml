Avenue and Hereford Street in the Back Bay with the Red Sox Natives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there if and when you can and hang as long as you are able. Watch the Red Sox vs White Sox game with the Red Sox Natives. Game time is 7:10pm. The Natives are a very friendly collection of Red Sox fans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a joint meetup with the Red Sox Natives where about 35 people showed last month. The Pour House is offering the Natives and all of us who show up a FREE hot dog buffet with all of the fixins', nacho bar and homemade apple crisp until 8pm, complimentary peanuts in the shell, (you may toss the shells on the floor) and chances to win Pour House Gift Cards by answering Baseball TRIVIA questions! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free swag was provided last time...and drinks are cheap.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please maintain your own tab or pay as you order.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info on the event and the Red Sox Natives meetup can be found at RedSoxNatives.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lower Level of The Pour House</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252016413000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251075101000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pour House Happy Hour &amp; Watch Sox Game with Red Sox Natives</name><id>11181949</id><headcount>34</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251239400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/11181949/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/d/global_9267149.jpeg</photo_url></item>
