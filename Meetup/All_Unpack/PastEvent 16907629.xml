&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : 12px"&gt;Hi Everyone &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is kinda last-minute but I believe that a great Liberty outreach opportunity has presented itself in the form of a protest in Dover, Monday morning against the parking meters. Many attending(inside of city hall) will be business people, but I am sure there will be some residents, as well. I think it would be great if some nicely dressed and polite people were standing outside of the door(s) where people enter, could be holding signs and offering pamphlets about Liberty, futility of government, etc. I will bring signs and have some pamphlets ready and be outside of Dover City Hall at 8:00. I think we could be outside and inside. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please, please let's do this as I think these will be not only be receptive, but with some information we could help them refine their focus. Hell, I will even buy people coffee and bring muffins to get them to show up!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Todd Puterbaugh</member_name><member_id>4083337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300108343000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1300053046000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Liberty Outreach / Dover Parking Meter Protest</name><id>16907629</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300104000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/16907629/</event_url></item>
