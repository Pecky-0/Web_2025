<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all!  Another last minute location post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we'll be meeting at "Szechuan Taste Chinese Food" in downtown Exeter, NH.  It is literally the building that runs right along the right side of the town off-street parking lot there.  I have no ghost reports per se, but several reports made by mediums and sensitives who've eaten there.  No one has said anything negative resides there, but more than one has said the feelings can get intense.  What the heck does THAT mean?  C'mon down and find out, I suppose!  :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly dinner meetings are primarily non-mandatory networking events. Although we talk business updates for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group. Because our regular place has closed down we are going back to our roots and will be choosing a different reportedly haunted location to meet at each month. Keep your eye on the meetup post for details. We look forward to you joining us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie Roy</member_name><member_id>4599203</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364434825000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852354000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>kgjdnyrfbkc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364423400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/107907312/</event_url></item>
