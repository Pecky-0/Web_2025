<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hey Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for not updating this event sooner.... I was away last week on Business and didn't have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the member that was hosting the event is unable to host the event right now.  I am sorry for the short notice.  Instead we'll be meeting for dinner and/or beverages at a restaurant/pub near the Beacon Hill.  I hope you can still make it.  If you need to find the group please call or text me at 617-459-5145.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>2881088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214004896000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211501074000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Expat Canadian June Meeting</name><id>7994824</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213831800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/7994824/</event_url></item>
