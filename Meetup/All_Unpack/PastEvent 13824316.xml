Just tell them you want the Meetup/Bruno table. HOWEVER, I will not be doing the buffet. You can bring snacks to share but please be discreet about it. NO COOLERS, PLEASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go early and try to snag seating at the white wrought iron gazebo. It was the best spot in the place last year, and we had it! I 'm hoping to pull it off again. Look for the red and blue balloon.
