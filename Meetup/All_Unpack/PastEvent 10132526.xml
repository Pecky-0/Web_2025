While challenging many myths that have been accepted as fact, Dr. Gutzman discusses how fundamental Constitutional principles have been undermined. His perspective is insightful and thought provoking. The presentation is a must for anyone who is interested in the evolution of our national economy and political culture. A period for book signings and questions and answers will follow Dr. Gutzmanâ€™s planned presentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Gutzman received his J.D. and M.P.Aff. from Texas (1990) and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Virginia (1999). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a copy of the ad that will be in the Ridgefield Press this Thursday. There will be no admission charge. All are welcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can make it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to pass this information along to others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Land&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240669868000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239072739000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Invitation: WCSU Professor Kevin Gutzman April 22 Ridgefield Community Center</name><id>10132526</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240439400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/10132526/</event_url></item>
