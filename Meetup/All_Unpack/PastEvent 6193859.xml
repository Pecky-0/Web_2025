He was a leading voice of the so-called Black Mountain Poets (which included Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Edward Dorn, and Joel Oppenheimer among others), named for the experimental college with which all were at one time or another associated.  George Butterick &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polis Is This: The Life and Art of Charles Olson (2006, 60 min.). A new film by award-winning filmmaker Henry Ferrini, Polis Is This explores the life and work of American poet Charles Olson. The enigmatic hulking six-foot-eight Harvard historian finds himself drifting back to the hard-luck New England fishing port of his boyhood summers. There he forges transcendent vision that links his besieged town, caught between tradition and modernity, to all places, in all times. Actor John Malkovich narrates this one-hour race for meaning that stretches from antiquity to yesterday, from the local to the universal, and from that which is most familiar to that which can only be imagined. Discussion with Henri Ferrini and writer/collaborator Ken Riaf follows screening.
