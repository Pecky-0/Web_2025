Johnny is quite popular and tickets will go fast. I have negotiated with TCAN for a reduced ticket cost of $23 for the show. To get this rate, I have to collect the money from you for the show and charge what I receive to my personal credit card. &lt;b&gt;So, if I don't receive the checks, you will be on your own for tickets.&lt;/b&gt; TCAN has reserved seats for us based on my collecting the money and presenting it to them for a group discounted rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make checks out in the amount of $23 payable to: Richard D'Apollo.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TCAN has extended my final count date to January 6th&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Send Checks to:&lt;br /&gt;Richard D'Apollo&lt;br /&gt;95 Outlook Drive&lt;br /&gt;Worcester, MA 01602&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The plan for Friday night, Feb 19, 2010 is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agostino's for Food at 6:00 PM SHARP !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;23 Washington Street&lt;br /&gt;Natick, MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;508-655-6643&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then on to TCAN for Blues by 7:30 PM to make the 8:00 PM show at:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Center for the Arts in Natick (TCAN)&lt;br /&gt;14 Summer Street&lt;br /&gt;Natick, MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to purchase tickets on your own, the number for Tickets and Information is 508.647.0097&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you do this, we won't be able to sit together.

But the Bostonian bluesman really came of age in the early '90s as a member of J. Geils Band front man Peter Wolf's Houseparty 5. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything he learned about supporting a song by knowing when to show off (and, more important, when not to) has been incorporated into his now elegant style: a potent blend of rock, jazz and blues tied together by a sweet tone and a constant emphasis on melody. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TCAN website [/url]&lt;a href="http://www.natickarts.org/tcan_artistdetail.php?artist_id=704&amp;amp;event_id=1398" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Rich at  Agostino's before the show.
