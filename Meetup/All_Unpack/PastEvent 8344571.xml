The two books are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Living Buddha, Living Christ by Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;br /&gt;+ One River, Many wells by Matthew Fox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good summer and enjoy these books....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 21, we will begin our new year with Living Buddha, Living Christ by Thich Nhat Hanh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all for now.
