We will also explore the surrounding neighborhood including the aqueduct trail, Cold Spring Park and perhaps the streets around Crystal Lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newtonconservators.org/8cemetery.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newtoncons...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Created in the 19th century naturalistic style pioneered by Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Watertown, Newton Cemetery is beautifully landscaped. Visitors are allowed to quietly view the grounds, but jogging, dog walking, food, and bicycling are not allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this serene spot you will find four ponds, graceful hillsides, and over 26 species of unusual trees such as marshall maple, castor auralia, shagbark hickory, hardy rubber tree, zelkova, amur corktree, camperdown elm, and weeping beech.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch afterwards the Union Street Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;107R Union St, Newton, MA&amp;#8206; - (617) 964-6684&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unionst.com&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walk is T accessible by the Newton Center station and has parking.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in  Newton Center in front of Johnny's Luncheonette</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1240524430000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236463242000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newton Cemetery walk</name><id>9904795</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240153200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9904795/</event_url></item>
