The Barkwood is a fun and safe place for the bullies to run. It is fenced in and has an indoor/outdoor area for play. Plenty of fresh water (and dishes) as well as waste disposal will be provided. There are a few requirements for this meetup. The Barkwood Inn would need to receive proof of Rabies,D/H/L/P, and Kennel Cough vaccines,also a negative fecal read done within the past year.  All info can be faxed or mailed to Gracy ATTN:Kim prior to May 1,2010.  This will insure the safety to the guests of The Barkwood Inn as well as all of our meetup friends. There will be an $8.00 charge per bulldog to be paid at time of meetup. The meetups will be held in the evenings for about 1 1/2 hrs. I am hoping for a great turnout so we can plan monthly meetups here at The Barkwood. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;                                             Kim Lachance             Fax: (508)434-0494 &lt;br /&gt;                                         462 Worcester Rd. &lt;br /&gt;                                        Charlton,Ma.01507        &lt;br /&gt;                      &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are right on RT.20 on the Oxford/Charlton line.
