We will meet at 7pm.  After the show we can go dancing at a local pub! Make your reservations at the Governors Inn and mention you are with "Trailblazers" and want to sit at the disignated table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Headlining the evening is the amazing Mike Koutrobis, an entertainer who has been stunning audiences for 25 years with his clever and comic insight. Drawing on his life growing up in an occasionally dysfunctional family, and on the difficulties of being a man, Koutrobis makes non-stop laughter. He combines witty, yet sarcastic commentary on interesting people he has met in his travels, and his travel for comedy has taken him to every corner of New England and the country &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Koutrobis is a regular at clubs and colleges all across New England and New York; opening for such performers as Harland Williams, Bob Nelson, Lenny Clarke and Reno Collier. He was recently aired nationally on The Steve Katsos show, and can be seen in the comic movies “Bride Wars”, “Mall Cop” and “The Invention of Lying.” &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;Sharing the stage on Nov. 23 at The Governor’s Inn will be Jay Grove, a comedian known throughout New England for his self-acclaimed ‘trailer park upbringing.’ That anyway is the basis for his hilarious musings about small town living, the struggles of dating, and being a country guy in the city. Grove has been wildly popular at Nascar events, and says of himself “I can work with a crowd that … fixes cars… rides in car seats… or steals cars… and we can still all have the same amount of fun.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Grove’s quick rise through the comedy ranks has allowed him to perform throughout New England, working with headliners like Kevin Knox, Joe Wong, and Tony Moschetto, as well as international headliner Wil Sylvince, Def Comedy Jam’s Vincent Oshana, and “Way Out TV” star Damon Wayans Jr. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The evening at the Governor’s Inn starts at 6:30 p.m. with casual menu selections from Spaulding Steak &amp;amp; Ale. Show tickets are $10 in advance and $15 at the door.
