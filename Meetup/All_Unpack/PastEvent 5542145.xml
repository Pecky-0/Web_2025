<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Sorry guys, I'm going to reschedule this for March 24th just in case people have any difficulty making it to this one. Hopefully we won't have snow then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn't like pizza? Being a transplant from California myself, I thought it might be fun to head out to the local CPK and just have a casual dinner. If you haven't met anyone in this meetup group, come out for a drink. Don't feel pressured to stay if you don't want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are coming, please RSVP at least 1 day before the event so I can be sure how many are coming. Also, please be sure you can attend before RSVPing &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing people there! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541104000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialnetworking</urlname><id>251346</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173199243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>California &amp; Pizza &amp; Fun!</name><id>5542145</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174773600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialnetworking/events/5542145/</event_url></item>
