He will be here Thursday through Sunday, giving seminars and meeting with people who are interested in learning about the mystical spiritual path.  Kicking of the weekend, on Thursday evening Father Peter will be giving a much-anticipated concert of his amazing folk/rock style music at New Haven's Little Theater, at the end of Lincoln Way (off of Trumbull, between Whitney and Orange). Come on out for a lively, warm, and wonderful evening of great music, with a friendly audience, and a chance to meet Father Peter afterward. He's a very dynamic yet approachable person, and this is an opportunity you won't want to miss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;additional details below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In peace,&lt;br /&gt;Rev.
