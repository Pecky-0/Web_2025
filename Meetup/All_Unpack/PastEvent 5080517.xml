The movie is called The Illusionist and the show time is 7:05.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets meet in front of the escalators at 6:45 (with your ticket in hand).   It might be a good idea to buy your ticket in advance since it has just recently been released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also planning on going to Cold Stones after the movie for an ice cream with anyone who is interested in ingesting some extra calories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact me if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1156806259000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155740918000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Meet up</name><id>5080517</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156633200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5080517/</event_url></item>
