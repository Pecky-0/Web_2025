Bring your questions and an open mind. This meeting is great for those who feel like they are just getting started or are not consistent in attracting what they put out there.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet from &lt;b&gt;10:00am-11:30pm&lt;/b&gt;.  I will have a meetup sign on our table. Call my cell phone if you don't see us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panera is in a small plaza of shops after Kelly's, next to Marshalls and across the street from Target off the the Lynn Fells Pkwy. It is on the South side of Route 1.        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!   &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie     &lt;br /&gt;Organizer &lt;br /&gt;617-678-5061&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>2696130</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260803714000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>northofbostonlawofattraction</urlname><id>567480</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The North-of-Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253163793000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Introduction to LOA Discussions</name><id>11394501</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260630000000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/northofbostonlawofattraction/events/11394501/</event_url></item>
