&lt;p&gt;Join us for fresh juices and healthy snacks to discuss our wellness plans for 2013. Maybe you want to lose some weight or just start eating better? Maybe you're looking to get more exercise or meet others who want to do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group will meet for friendly support, healthy meals, wellness discussions, recipe tips and workout ideas every other Wednesday. When you RSVP, there will be a few questions to answer and then the meeting location will be emailed to you a couple days before the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this discussion group, we may also make plans to meet at other times during the week for fitness sessions such as walking, biking, hiking, yoga, tennis or aerobic-type classes. Bring your ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another discussion topic might be sustaining healthy eating habits. So please bring any diet &amp;amp; nutrition books, pamphlets or websites that you would like to share.&lt;/p&gt;
