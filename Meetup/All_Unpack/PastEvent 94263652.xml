 Prof. McCormick, who has given two previous DAS talks, is a very knowledgeable and engaging speaker. And, in the words of Michael Martin, Prof. Emeritus of Philosophy at Boston University and author of Atheism: A Philosophical Justification (1990) and The Case Against Christianity (1991), "McCormick's book is one of the best—if not the best—critiques of the core of Christianity ever written." &lt;br /&gt;

 The location will be Rm. 203 in the Boston University Photonics Center, 8 St. Mary's St., Boston (a half block from the "BU Central" stop on the B Greenline train). Rm. 203 is one of the large lecture rooms down the hall on the left as you enter the building from St. Mary's St. It's free and open to all. &lt;br /&gt;

"The more we consider the theological God, the more impossible and contradictory will he appear." — Paul Thiry d'Holbach, The System of Nature (1770) &lt;br /&gt;

 The Disproof Atheism Society (www.disproofatheism.org), founded in 1994, brings together people from around the world who recognize and support the development of a growing number of empirical and conceptual disproofs of the existence of God. &lt;br /&gt;
