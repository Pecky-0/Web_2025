Complete your 5 mile run, and receive a Table Talk mini pie and a long sleeve t-shirt.  You get to burn off calories and then put them right back on with a pie.  What more can you want?  This is a local tradition and a very fun event on Thanksgiving morning.   The run starts at 8:30 AM at the Newport County YMCA in Middletown, but I thought people who wanted to run could meet at Easton's (First) Beach in Newport, near the carousel, and drive together since it can be difficult meeting up at the race.  For those of you who don't want to run, they also offer a walk.  Don't forget to bring a canned item for the food drive. This run is good for the body, good for the soul, and good for the taste buds!  Hope to see you there.  &lt;br /&gt;Paula  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details, course description,  and registration, go to &lt;a href="http://needtorace.com/race.php?calendar_id=5768" target="_blank"&gt;http://needtorace.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot near the playground.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259414023000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257372624000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pie Run 5 mile race on Thanksgiving Morning - Earn Your Dessert</name><id>11796641</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259240400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11796641/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/4/global_11646388.jpeg</photo_url></item>
