I just got my scehdule for the week, and I'm only working the night job Fri &amp;amp; Sat (oh good....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join me on Wednesday to play board games.  I'll update the event when I go home today to tell you what kinds of games that I have at home. (Other games are welcome).  I'll email you the address in North Haven - while I do have a longish driveway, to ensure that people do not get blocked in I would recommend parking in the street.  BYOB -  I will provide snacks.  There are cats &amp;amp; dogs in the house, so please take an antihistamine if you feel the need to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone to has offered to bring things - how about paper goods?  like little plates, napkins, etc?  That would be helpful; if you can, just put it in your RSVP so that people know that it's taken care of.  Also, I know I said BYOB, but I'm sure that if you wanted to bring a bottle of wine or something no one would complain! Other than that, don't worry - just come and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193440277000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190736420000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game night at Devorah's</name><id>6424802</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193266800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6424802/</event_url></item>
