The hall is absolutely beautiful, and the acoustics are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program is a bit of a departure from our usual Wednesday night fare:  The NEC Wind Ensemble will be playing, and the focus will be on music inspired by jazz.  Charles Peltz will again be conducting (he conducted the concert 2 weeks ago as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details about the concert, go to &lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-wind-ensemble" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-wind-ensemble" target="_blank"&gt;http://necmusic.edu/n...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but let's meet up at 7:30, so the group has a chance to get good seats and socialize a bit before the concert.  We usually end up sitting in the left side of center section just past the overhang, but if the balcony is open, I will always try to sit in the left-middle balcony section, since it affords a good view of the orchestra, and any pianist's hands should there be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Jordan Hall:&lt;br /&gt;The hall is located at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=jordan+Hall,+Boston+MA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=59.467068,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.342781,-71.085577&amp;amp;spn=0.006883,0.020599&amp;amp;z=17" target="_blank"&gt;the corner of Huntington and Gainsborough streets&lt;/a&gt;, about a block south of the Symphony T stop on the Green Line.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt; There is currently black canvas covering the entire side of the building and the sidewalk, as I believe the facade is under repair.  The main entrance is reached from Gainsborough Street, under the scaffolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serenade for Winds by Alec Wilder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stravinsky's Ebony Concerto (composed for Woody Herman)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Music from Kurt Weill's Little Three-Penny Opera music&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bernard Rands' Ceremonial for winds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will stand in the lobby until 7:45, after which I will join the group, either in the left side of the center section, just past the overhang, or, if it's open, upstairs in the left-middle balcony section.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Will</member_name><member_id>7339843</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258159175000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257355375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Classical Concert Series:  NEC Wind Ensemble</name><id>11793537</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257985800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11793537/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/5/global_10915013.jpeg</photo_url></item>
