Conveniently located on the green line steps from Coolidge Corner, it's a terrific and relatively inexpensive deli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll use the time to get to know one another and to discuss not only the role of the organizer (and related war stories) but the direction of the group as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is open to all organizers, it's really a meeting focused on the Boston-area chapter of NE Meetup Organizers, which will be our focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!`&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232754191000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Organizers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NEOrganizers</urlname><id>321127</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>New England Meetup Organizers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228350133000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NE Organizers Winter Meetup - Boston</name><id>9275849</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232580600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NEOrganizers/events/9275849/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/0/3/global_4756611.jpeg</photo_url></item>
