This session on Sunday January 24 at 12:30 is part of the new 6 week classes on Meditation and Mysticism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This series is designed to help you to understand the laws of the universe, start or deepen your meditation practice and explore the foundations of Mysticism. Even if some of the Teachings are based on the Christian Mystical Tradition, this is open to all. There is no restriction on faith and spiritual background. You only have to believe that there is most likely a power and intelligence that is higher than human intelligence. &lt;br /&gt;In each class we explore three areas: &lt;br /&gt;• Spiritual exercises designed to help you develop skills needed for inner work and meditation &lt;br /&gt;• Understanding the cosmos, the Laws and Beings that govern it, and our roles as living, conscious humans in that cosmos &lt;br /&gt;• Hands-on experiences, through which you can learn to see, hear, and feel the spiritual world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These classes have been taught for many years to many people. Take this opportunity for yourself. If Sundays doesn't work with your schedule, there are some other dates and times in different locations like in Cambridge (near Alewife T station) n Wednesdays at 7 pm and in Newton (near Mass Pike) on Fridays at 7 pm. &lt;br /&gt;Contact me if any questions via e-mail or phone. I will be glad to answers them. &lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, &lt;br /&gt;Rev.
