How about some wine/drinks at Blu? This will be the fourth time we'll be heading to Blu. This is for those who weren't able to come last time. People seem to really like Blu. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be reserving the large booth/table overlooking the Paramount Theatre. Very comfortable and great for group conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu originally was the private restaurant for the Sports Club members and The Ritz Carlton residence and hotel. For a while now it's been open to the public but it's somewhat hidden so it's never crowded. This is why prices are so reasonable/moderate. Not only do I appreciate the venue for it's food and service, the bar and dining room have large 30 foot high windows that have an unobstructed view overlooking Washington Street and downtown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's share a few bottles of wine or have a few drinks and maybe some tapas/dinner .... if that's what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME:&lt;br /&gt;7:00PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLACE:&lt;br /&gt;Blu Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;4 Avery St., 4th Floor (The LA Sports Club Entrance)&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02111&lt;br /&gt;(617) 375-8550&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you at Blu for some wine/drinks and maybe something to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike/Meet up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246057899000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235434692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Some Wine/drinks &amp; maybe dinner at Blu </name><id>9807352</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245884400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9807352/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/e/global_7604142.jpeg</photo_url></item>
