It's a nice bar with good food, and they have salsa wednesday nights in the neighboring room so there's something for everyone!  We had a fantastic time there in May, and hope you guys will be able to join us this time around!  ***note, there's no cover for the karaoke, but there's a $7 cover for the salsa...***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there, whether you're singing or cheering on the singers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C line to St Mary's St, first stop after Kenmore.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>must sign up for the meetup to find out!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248483916000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243487480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karaoke at An Tua Nua</name><id>10511589</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248310800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10511589/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/f/global_8845759.jpeg</photo_url></item>
