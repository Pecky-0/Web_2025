The state has designated the area as an important grassland and a natural habitat for plants and animals that have been forced from former farmland. Rock Meadow offers hiking, birding, biking, picnicking and wandering opportunities. The area is also the home of Belmont's community gardens. It resembles the meadows in the south of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parking lot may be crowded if Sunday turns out a sunny day.  When the lot is full, I've seen people park:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  along Mill Street bordering Rock Meadow and the old barn that stands on one side of the driveway down to the RM parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  there is parking on the shoulder of Concord Ave on the Rock Meadow side. The spot is right before Concord meets up with Mill St if heading East i.e towards Belmont center, very near where Concord meets Winter Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  there is a small parking lot on Mill Street on the opposite side of Rock Meadow.  If you are heading towards Trapelo Rd. (South),  it is about 1 block's worth from the entrance to Rock Meadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are chairs beneath the Crabapple tree beside the entrance to the community gardens: &amp;nbsp;let's meet there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6025746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307306700000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Subnats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>science-88</urlname><id>1005141</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Suburban Naturalists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307204574000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock Meadow</name><id>20953681</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307289600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/science-88/events/20953681/</event_url></item>
