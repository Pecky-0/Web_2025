This will be a laid-back affair, to last from 11 until at least 2... members are free to drop by as they wish, but should definitely RSVP so I can make arrangements for a larger table if need be. Keep in mind that as Charles River Writers, you get a 20% discount at Meetup gatherings. Ask me for details. If you are a new member and would like to join us for this brunch meeting, please drop me a line so we can properly tune your expectations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mea culpa, my friends and colleagues; I have let the summer doldrums lull me into a less reliable routine. I shall resume more regular weekly e-mails, with the expected literary events, etc, beginning next Friday. We shall continue to meet on Sundays, unless I receive requests for other days. Please note that the indicated meeting for the 20th has been canceled. Suggestions for other venues are needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally... I'd like to plan the annual book crawl on a weekend day. When before October 15th works for y'all, and at what times? I intend to nail these plans down in the next two weeks, so please do let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zachary Bos&lt;br /&gt;Organizer, Boston Poetry&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning Vegetable Lamb Hunter&lt;br /&gt;IM: &amp;quot;Five Quartets&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;#: 617-935-4951&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1157468538000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157165195000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Writers Brunch at Trident</name><id>5108700</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1157295600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/5108700/</event_url></item>
