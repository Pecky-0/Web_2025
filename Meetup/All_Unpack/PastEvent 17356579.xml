We'll have live music, great food, great conversation, refreshing beverages, and the finest (and coolest) of business networking opportunities. This year we're being co-sponsored by Pioneer Valley Local First, which I encourage everyone to check out at www.PVLocalFirst.org. They're a great group of local businesses dedicated to making the Pioneer Valley a better place to live. Other sponsors include Full Spectrum Reiki, Paper City Brewery, Gramp's Restaurant, and the newly forming Creatrix 413 Network. BBQ and Keg Tapping starts at 5pm, and the music will start in the early evening. All musicians are invited to bring their instruments and jam along. There will be a PA and mikes and a house drum kit and we're hoping for a lot of creative jamming. Last party the music went til after 4am. We're very excited that this year fantastic local artist Donna Estabrooks will be our featured exhibit, with many of her paintings on display and available for purchase. Thanks Donna! See her work at www.DonnaEstabrooks.com Check out www.Positronic.TV for videos of previous parties and call 413.532.6440 if you have any questions.
